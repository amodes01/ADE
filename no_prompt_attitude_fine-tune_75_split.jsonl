And he wasn't some \\\\\\\"Britain First\\\\\\\" character like the assassin of British MP Jo Cox, where everything is about national sovereignty.  \\\\\\\"The structure of the United States of Europe, if well and truly built, will be such as to make the material strength of a single state less important,\\\\\\\" Churchill stated. \\\\\\\"Small nations will count as much as large ones and gain their honor by their contribution to the common cause.\\\\\\\"  Of course he did not like some of the specific plans of his day, namely the Treaty of Paris as well as the European Defense Community. But when he got back into office after his party lost parliament in 1945, he pushed hard for the West European Union.  \\\\\\\"If we are to form a United States of Europe, or whatever name it may take, we must begin now. \\\\u2026 Our constant aim must be to build and fortify the strength of the United Nations organization. Under and within that world concept, we must recreate the European family in a regional structure, called, it may be, the United States of Europe, and the first practical step would be to form a Council of Europe. If at first all states of Europe are not willing or able to join the union, we must nevertheless proceed to assemble and combine those who will and can.\\\\\\\"  I am sure there are some who would say that things are different now than in Churchill's time, with Middle East refugees. But the great British Prime Minister knew that xenophobia and hatred of others was what led to the need for a stronger Europe to combat these in the first place.  \\\\\\\"It is from Europe that has sprung that series of frightful and nationalistic morals originated by the Teutonic nations in their rise to power, which we have seen in the 20th century and which have for a long time wrecked the peace and marred the prospects of all mankind,\\\\\\\" Churchill told the people.  He also credited \\\\\\\"that great republic across the Atlantic Ocean has at length realized that the ruin or enslavement of Europe has involved their own fate as well.\\\\\\\"  That's right - Churchill wanted the United States to play a strong role in helping foster a unified Europe.

On Thursday, Britain will decide whether to remain or leave the EU, a decision that has threatened to divide Europe.

When asked Wednesday how he feels about the possibility of the United Kingdom leaving the EU, Trump said it was his \\\\\\\"inclination\\\\\\\" that they should get out. But \\\\\\\"I do not think anybody should listen to me [because] I have not really focused on it very much,\\\\\\\" the potential next leader of the free world said.  On Thursday, Britain will decide whether to remain or leave the EU, a decision that has threatened to divide Europe. The implications are radical for the United States: Following World War II, the EU brought stability and order to Europe, and as a single unit it has helped the U.S. with geopolitical responsibilities around the world. On the economic front alone, President Obama has urged against a Brexit, saying it could take as many as 10 years for Britain to negotiate new trade deals with the States.

London School of Economics researchers recently estimated that investment flows into Britain could fall as much as 22 percent as companies, including American firms, move operations elsewhere or put plans on hold in the wake of a leave vote. This would translate to a 2,200-British pound ($3,234) decline in real income per household, they said.  Advertisement  The study also concluded that two major bright spots in the UK economy, financial services and autos, would suffer from a Brexit.  LSE also said annual UK car manufacturing would decline by 181,000 units, or 12 percent, due to higher European tariffs if Britain reverts to World Trade Organization trading status.  It added that financial firms based in Britain would likely see \\\\\\\"big cuts\\\\\\\" after losing their \\\\\\\"passport\\\\\\\" arrangements to operate in EU countries without having to set up costly local subsidiaries.  JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon earlier this month warned staff in Bournemouth, where a quarter of the banking giant's 16,000 UK employees are based, that this would cost jobs.  Advertisement  \\\\\\\"After a Brexit, we cannot do it all here, and we will have to start planning for that. I do not know if it means 1,000 jobs, 2,000 jobs; it could be as many as 4,000,\\\\\\\" Dimon said.  Ford Motor Co , which has factories scattered across the UK and Europe, told employees in a letter on Monday that it could face tariffs of up to 2.7 percent on UK engine exports and 10 percent on vehicles, potentially costing \\\\\\\"hundreds of millions of dollars every year.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"This would significantly impact our business,\\\\\\\" Ford Britain Managing Director Andy Barratt wrote. Profits at Ford's European operations are just starting to return to pre-2008 crisis levels after years of losses and painful plant closures.  CHOCOLATE DIVERGENCE  Advertisement  Other firms that use Britain as an export base also worry about a gradual regulatory divergence between the UK and EU.  Mars Inc. Vice President for Public Affairs Matthias Berninger told Reuters that a post-Brexit Britain would likely want to set its own standards for food safety and chocolate or pet food ingredients, creating problems for a European production network optimized for efficiency over the past 40 years.

London School of Economics researchers recently estimated that investment flows into Britain could fall as much as 22 percent as companies, including American firms, move operations elsewhere or put plans on hold in the wake of a leave vote. This would translate to a 2,200-British pound ($3,234) decline in real income per household, they said.  Advertisement  The study also concluded that two major bright spots in the UK economy, financial services and autos, would suffer from a Brexit.  LSE also said annual UK car manufacturing would decline by 181,000 units, or 12 percent, due to higher European tariffs if Britain reverts to World Trade Organization trading status.  It added that financial firms based in Britain would likely see \\\\\\\"big cuts\\\\\\\" after losing their \\\\\\\"passport\\\\\\\" arrangements to operate in EU countries without having to set up costly local subsidiaries.  JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon earlier this month warned staff in Bournemouth, where a quarter of the banking giant's 16,000 UK employees are based, that this would cost jobs.

I do not know if it means 1,000 jobs, 2,000 jobs; it could be as many as 4,000,\\\\\\\" Dimon said.  Ford Motor Co , which has factories scattered across the UK and Europe, told employees in a letter on Monday that it could face tariffs of up to 2.7 percent on UK engine exports and 10 percent on vehicles, potentially costing \\\\\\\"hundreds of millions of dollars every year.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"This would significantly impact our business,\\\\\\\" Ford Britain Managing Director Andy Barratt wrote. Profits at Ford's European operations are just starting to return to pre-2008 crisis levels after years of losses and painful plant closures.  CHOCOLATE DIVERGENCE  Advertisement  Other firms that use Britain as an export base also worry about a gradual regulatory divergence between the UK and EU.  Mars Inc. Vice President for Public Affairs Matthias Berninger told Reuters that a post-Brexit Britain would likely want to set its own standards for food safety and chocolate or pet food ingredients, creating problems for a European production network optimized for efficiency over the past 40 years.

{"instruction": "Extract attitudes from the article in JSON format", "input": "Investors and markets around the world are on edge as Britain decides whether it will stay in the European Union. The uncertainty around the future of Europe as we know it sent markets tumbling last week, and the CBOE volatility index, a measure of investor fear, spiked.  Investors have significant positions in foreign funds these days. Over the last decade, investors poured $643 billion into world stock funds, while they pulled $834 billion out of U.S. stock funds, according to the Investment Company Institute's 2016 Fact Book. So they are naturally concerned about how the so-called Brexit could affect their portfolios.  Some investors have recently sold their foreign funds. \\\\\\\"Investors pulled $1.1 billion from U.K. equity funds in the week to yesterday, according to data from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. This was the fastest rate of withdrawals in 13 months,\\\\\\\" according to data from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. This was the fastest rate of withdrawals in 13 months,\\\\\\\" according to The Street.  But we know that the best returns come from staying invested long term. Those who sell out of the market today will have to decide when to get invested again, and history shows that by the time investors feel ready to get back in the market, they have often missed out on significant gains.  Do not let uncertainty hold you back  Often investors wait to see how things progress, but this assumes that eventually they will feel more certain about where the market's headed. The reality is that uncertainty is part of investing, just like it's part of life, and as investors, we have to come to terms with uncertainty if we hope to get ahead.  Even after Thursday's vote, there will still be uncertainty. If Britain votes to leave the E.U., there will be two years of negotiations on the terms of the separation. And even then, we will not know how Britain and the E.U. will do on their own. So if you need to be invested to reach your goals, then get invested. Do not let the uncertainty of a Brexit hold you back from doing the work you need to do to get ahead.  Invest in what you know now -- and adapt as markets change  Focus on what you know now. You know why you are invested and what you are trying to accomplish. For most of us, investing is not just about money, it's about having the freedom to live the life we want-to retire on our schedule, to give our kids the option to go to the college of their choice. These goals are not tied to the result of the British referendum.  You also know that over the long term-even through times of global crisis and political upheaval-investing in stocks has been the best way to make money. The volatility of stocks makes it tough to hold stocks long enough to benefit from their terrific long-term results, but if you stick it out, those gains can change your life.  Another thing you probably know is how different areas of the market have been performing lately and, long before the Brexit, Europe wasn't performing well. Most Europe funds and ETFs have been out of favor for some time now; the iShares MSCI Eurozone ETF (EZU) has lagged the S&P 500 for the last three years running, and my firm's Upgrading strategy has kept us out of these funds.  U.S. funds are currently in favor  Decades of academic research and a January 2016 Morningstar study have found that funds that have done well recently tend to continue to do well for the next few months or even years . At the moment, that means U.S. stock funds. And funds that have not performed well tend to remain out of favor for some time.

Again, it is - to me - inarguable that Britain performed worse after 1945 than most of Western Europe. The question is why. It may, as Tombs implies, have been mere post-war catch-up. But it was likely more than that. Britain does seem to have suffered from union-induced overmanning and amateurism in sectors of British corporate management (car manufacturers spring to mind). Worse, after 1945, the U.K. went down the road of nationalization, currency controls and demand management, all of which tended to prioritize stability and vested interests over creative destruction and dynamism.

I am more excited about the potential of developing relationships outside of Europe in terms of Canada and US.\\\\\\\"  While many are concerned about the immediate effects of a UK exit, including the damage to the exchange rate and the power of the pound, in his chat to Harpers, McLaren asked the trade to keep an open mind to the possibility of long-term benefits.  \\\\\\\"I think the danger is that most people with think about how it will affect next week's mortgage payments rather than what we could be achieving in five years time,\\\\\\\" he said.  \\\\\\\"I think leaving is the more interesting proposition. There is more potential in it for rapid change and advancement rather than the safe option which is next week to be back where we were before.\\\\\\\"  Tim North at Les Grands Chais de France, traders of wines and alcohols in France with strong UK connections, disagrees.  He says that the devil is in the - in this case, the unseen - detail.  \\\\\\\"There are so many unseen barriers to trade that people do not know about. At the moment the legalities on drinks labels are the same for the UK as the rest of Europe. If we leave and the legislation changes, then producers exporting to England would have to come up with two separate labels. I know many small French producers who would be very affected by the additional costs. This goes for the wider world too - including California,\\\\\\\" he said.  North also challenged the idea that leaving the EU would lead to Britain becoming more entrenched in a global market.  \\\\\\\"It's ridiculous to think you can turn the clock back to the way it was before. The world is changing. In terms of technology and communication, the world is becoming smaller. We need to be part of a bigger group if we want to thrive in the modern world.\\\\\\\"  McClaren went on to point out that from an external point of view, having a national identity separate from Europe would drive innovation in how products are tailored to the UK market.  He said: \\\\\\\"A lot of Americans like to think of Europe as a market, so they think the British must be same as the Germans. Only when they delve deeper do they realise there is big different between a French or German and British consumer.\\\\\\\"  He also argues that the deep rooted relationships between England and Europe's top producing wine countries, will ensure longevity.  \\\\\\\"If we leave, people will still buy the cars they want to buy and they will continue drink wine from France and Italy and Spain purely out of convenience, because they are so close, and because we have been doing it for decades. People in the wine business are some of the most traditional in the world. There will be difficulties if we leave but no one can say what they will be until we face them head on.\\\\\\\"  However, he concedes, \\\\\\\"I am not saying let us", "output": "[{\"entity1\": {\"entity\": \"John McLaren\", \"references\": [\"John McLaren\"]"}

Will leaving the EU lead to the break-up of the UK?  What will happen to immigration if there is Brexit?  Will Brexit make the UK more or less safe?  Will the UK benefit from being released from EU laws?  Will leaving the EU save taxpayers money and mean more money for the NHS?  What will Brexit mean for British tourists booking holidays in the EU?  Will Brexit help or damage the environment?  Will Brexit mean that Europeans have to leave the UK?  What will Brexit mean for British expats in Europe?", "output": "[{\"entity1\": {\"entity\": \"UK\", \"references\": [\"UK\"]"}

Well, the UK government has already reached an agreement with the EU on out-of-work benefits. Newly arrived EU migrants are banned from claiming jobseekers' allowance for three months. If they have not found a job within six months they will be required to leave. EU migrant workers in the UK who lose their job, through no fault of their own, are entitled to the same benefits as UK citizens, including jobseekers' allowance and housing benefit, for six months.

Research published last year by the Office for Budget Responsibility suggested there was a small negative effect of migration on the wages of locals in the semi-skilled and unskilled service sector, such as care workers, shop assistants, restaurant and bar workers but the impact of migration on the wages of the UK-born in this sector since 2004 has been no more than 1 per cent over a period of eight years.  Finally, immigration is not a single issue debate. Significant economic issues are linked. If the UK wants future access to the EU Single Market, we will not be able to \\\\\\\"control our borders\\\\\\\". Free movement of people lies at the core of EU values alongside free access to EU markets. The Leave campaign has shifted its viewpoint from wanting to negotiate access to the Single Market to seeking alternative models in order to keep the focus on immigration, not economics.

First, the most startling fact is that the House of Commons has undertaken a significant study on this but failed to (successfully at least) publish it. One has to resort to an independent and comprehensive report from the Centre for European Policy Studies to find the outcome of the House of Commons analysis: 6.8 per cent of primary UK legislation and 13.8 per cent of UK secondary legislation had a role in implementing EU law - 20.6 per cent of legislation in total compared to the 75 per cent that we hear from prominent Leave campaigners.

In our mountains, poor forest lands management in our urban forest communities, such as Big Bear, Running Springs and Lake Arrowhead (building foundations within drip lines or right up to the trunks, trees growing through decks, paving over treed areas, etc.), has weakened trees and caused an exacerbation of bark beetle populations even in average rainfall years. The trees' natural means of expelling bark beetles is to pump sap, literally blocking the beetles in their bore holes. With the drought, the trees can not produce enough sap and the bark beetle populations have exploded from the urban forest areas out into the natural forestlands, devastating some areas with high numbers of tree mortalities. These standing dead trees are like match sticks, waiting for a spark or lightning strike.\\\\\\\"  Website: http://www.redlands.edu  Contact: Jennifer Dobbs, [email protected]  Causes of Wildfires and Environmental Impacts of Drought  Wendy McIntyre  Professor, Environmental Studies  University of Redlands  \\\\\\\"The drought is the most important reason that fire season is growing each year. Weather does play a role, especially when rain or snow changes the susceptibility of ecosystems to fire, and how the rain or snow falls -- i.e., do we get rains in huge downpours (which mostly runs off) or in slower steady showers that can soak into the ground and be available to plants to keep them growing and less fire-prone.\\\\\\\"  Website: http://www.redlands.edu  Contact: Jennifer Dobbs, [email protected]  Deaf-Blind Awareness Week Begins June 26  Beth Kennedy  Director of DeafBlind Central  Central Michigan University  \\\\\\\"Deafblindness is a disability of access.

Automakers need to show more urgency when dangerous defects become apparent. Says Ball: \\\\\\\"What we see over and over again in these situations is that automakers are aware of product defects, but they alert consumers only after injuries mount and regulators finally step in to force a recall. Once recalls are issued, these global corporations show a shameful lack of urgency in making sure vehicle owners are aware of the dangers. While investigators are calling this a 'tragic accident,' it's clear that Jeep should be doing a much better job warning motorists of the potential problems that could cause their vehicles to roll away like this.\\\\\\\"  Contact: Robert Tharp, [email protected]  Drought-Related Fire Hazard and Environment Impact/Issues  Timothy Krantz  Professor, Environmental Studies  University of Redlands  \\\\\\\"One has a situation where the past decade of average or below-average precipitation has resulted in a cumulative fire risk. In our mountains, poor forest lands management in our urban forest communities, such as Big Bear, Running Springs and Lake Arrowhead (building foundations within drip lines or right up to the trunks, trees growing through decks, paving over treed areas, etc.), has weakened trees and caused an exacerbation of bark beetle populations even in average rainfall years. The trees' natural means of expelling bark beetles is to pump sap, literally blocking the beetles in their bore holes. With the drought, the trees can not produce enough sap and the bark beetle populations have exploded from the urban forest areas out into the natural forestlands, devastating some areas with high numbers of tree mortalities. These standing dead trees are like match sticks, waiting for a spark or lightning strike.\\\\\\\"  Website: http://www.redlands.edu  Contact: Jennifer Dobbs, [email protected]  Causes of Wildfires and Environmental Impacts of Drought  Wendy McIntyre  Professor, Environmental Studies  University of Redlands  \\\\\\\"The drought is the most important reason that fire season is growing each year. Weather does play a role, especially when rain or snow changes the susceptibility of ecosystems to fire, and how the rain or snow falls -- i.e., do we get rains in huge downpours (which mostly runs off) or in slower steady showers that can soak into the ground and be available to plants to keep them growing and less fire-prone.\\\\\\\"  Website: http://www.redlands.edu  Contact: Jennifer Dobbs, [email protected]  Deaf-Blind Awareness Week Begins June 26  Beth Kennedy  Director of DeafBlind Central  Central Michigan University  \\\\\\\"Deafblindness is a disability of access.

The UK's IT industry is worth \\\\u00a358 billion to the economy annually. London-based tech firms alone raised \\\\u00a31.09 billion in venture capital last year. There are 42.4 million smartphone users in the UK, and that's steadily rising. We are the world's fifth biggest economy, and technology and science make up a big part of that.  Leaving the EU will have consequences for every sector, and technology is no exception. No one can say for certain what will happen when (presumably) leave, however Norway - who chose not to enter the EU in 1994 and was often cited as an example by pro-Brexit campaigners - delivered a warning that being alone is not all fun and games.  Of course the politicians can be wrong, the experts can be wrong, and the business leaders can be wrong - this is new territory. They can also be right, and some of the world's most influential technologists have been quite vocal about the EU referendum.  Related: 4 ways Brexit is melting the internet  What are big tech companies saying?  There is no shortage of corporate bigwigs wading in on the EU debate, and that's a good thing. When it comes to Brexit, it's important to get a view of what our country's biggest technology business leaders believe will happen. It's their livelihoods on the line, after all.  It's no surprise that the Remain camp has garnered the lion's share of support from big business. The majority of UK exports to the EU, across both services and manufacturing, can largely (though not exclusively) be sourced to the major corporations.  Some of the key tech players throwing their lot in with Remain include: Bill Gates (Founder of Microsoft), Richard Branson (Founder of Virgin), Stephen Hawking (Award-winning physicist), Stephen Fry (Actor and technology columnist), Dr Ian Robertson (Board member at BMW, Gavin Patterson (CEO of BT), Martha Lane Fox (Founder of Lastminute.com), Dido Harding (CEO of TalkTalk), Ronan Dunne (CEO of Telefonica O2 UK), David Stokes (CEO of IBM), and Tim Berners-Lee (inventor of the World Wide Web).  Here's Richard Branson talking about his fears for Brexit:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1u8iMKml8xI  Bill Gates said that a post-Brexit Britain would be a \\\\\\\"significantly less attractive place to do business and invest\\\\\\\". He added:  \\\\\\\"While ultimately a matter for the British people to decide, it is clear to me that if Britain chooses to be outside of Europe\\\\u2026it will be harder to find and recruit the best talent from across the continent; talent which, in turn, creates jobs for people in the UK.\\\\\\\"  And Chris Kenyon, the Senior Vice President at Canonical - the British minds behind the Ubuntu operating system - said:  \\\\\\\"Canonical supports the Remain campaign, and believes the UK will fare better, socially and economically, inside the European Union. Employment conditions, safety standards, scientific advancement and economic vibrancy all improve with access to larger pools of talent and customers.\\\\\\\"  Microsoft founder Bill Gates supports the Remain campaign  Kenyon added that the UK has a \\\\\\\"special deal\\\\\\\" with Europe, that is \\\\\\\"a better deal than any other country will ever obtain, or that the UK could ever attain again\\\\\\\".  The technology industry's Leave camp is a little smaller, granted. Nevertheless, important industry leaders have spoken out", "output": "[{\"entity1\": {\"entity\": \"Bill Gates\", \"references\": [\"Bill Gates\"]"}

So we have heard from big business, but there is more to the UK economy that giant corporations. What does the UK's booming tech start-up sector have to say about the prospect of Brexit?  Well, it seems that the vast majority of start-ups are keen to stay in the EU. A recent study by Coadec found that 81% of people in the digital start-up sector are hoping for a Remain vote. The sample size was 175, including 126 start-up founders, 26 start-up employees, 19 investors, and four others.  The study revealed that the key issues for the Remainers were:  Access to a large single market, with harmonised regulations  Free movement of labour, giving access to a talented workforce  Having a 'seat at the table'  Stability and security  The key issues for Leavers, meanwhile, were:  Sovereignty  Over-regulation and red tape  \\\\\\\"These results are not surprising,\\\\\\\" explains Coadec in its survey analysis. \\\\\\\"The UK's start-up community is international in its outlook and in its composition.

And they aim to sell and expand across a trading block of 500 million consumers.\\\\\\\"  The Coadec survey is not alone in its findings, either. A survey from Tech London Advocates found 87% of start-ups wanted to remain, while research by techUK found that 71% wanted to remain in a reformed EU.  In fact, a Brexit vote could be felt very acutely by many of the UK's tech start-ups. That's because of the uncertainty over immigration legislation and the possible loss of free movement of labour.  Robert Newry, who founded technology recruitment service Arctic Shores, believes that the current interest in UK start-ups will \\\\\\\"dry up\\\\\\\" if we leave the EU:  \\\\\\\" We currently have 14 employees, four are European, three of whom are first-generation .

According to the Royal Society, we receive a greater amount of EU research funding than we contribute. Between 2007 and 2013, we received 8.8 billion euros for research, development, and innovation activities.

A further 4.63% are unsure, and 11.91% want to leave the EU. And even amongst researchers that intend to vote, 80% are against leaving the EU.  Professor Stephen Hawking called the prospect of Brexit a \\\\\\\"disaster for UK science\\\\\\\" in a letter to the Times newspaper, signed by over 150 fellows of the Royal Society. The letter reads:  \\\\\\\" First, increased funding has raised greatly the level of European science as a whole and of the UK in particular because we have a competitive edge.

Better still, roaming charges across Europe will be scrapped entirely from 2017. That means you can not be charged extra for using your phone texts, minutes, or data when travelling within the European Union.  That's an impressive feat, and here's why.

In front of a crowd of 6,000, three Remain debaters - London Mayor Sadiq Khan, Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson, and General Secretary of the Trades Union Congress Frances O'Grady - faced off against Vote Leave's Boris Johnson, Minister of State for Energy Andrea Leadsom, and Labour MP Gisela Stuart.

All EU countries should have a referendum.\\\\\\\" British Prime Minister David Cameron and his eurosceptic opponents made final pitches for wavering voters on Wednesday on the referendum, with the outcome still too close to call.

WSP Global Inc., an engineering services company with offices in 40 countries, is another stock to consider, he said. If the U.K. votes to stick with the EU, Belisle will consider Canadian and U.S. banks amid \\\\\\\"more widespread buying\\\\\\\" as the overhang of Brexit concern fades. In such a scenario, global stocks could gain about 5 per cent over several days, with the S&P/TSX having as much as 8 per cent upside. With investors paying a premium for protection against calamity in the equity market, this presents an opportunity for options investors to take advantage by buying cheap calls if Brexit fails, according to Hans Albrecht, a fund manager at Horizons ETFs Management Canada Inc. A measure of the spread in prices between 1-month bullish and bearish options, or skew, in the iShares S&P/TSX 60 Index exchange-traded fund, the largest, most liquid ETF in Canada, jumped to the highest level since 2011 Wednesday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Even after the S&P/TSX rally this year, the too-close-to-call outcome of the vote and the low cost of contracts that pay in the event Canadian shares rise make now the time to boost bullish bets, Albrecht said.

There is a widespread feeling, backed up by economic data, that most citizens keep falling behind as their wages and incomes lag below the true increase in their cost of living.  There is also, throughout the United States and Europe, a feeling that their countries are besieged by immigration from people of different cultures and backgrounds which also has the effect of threatening their livelihood by bringing large numbers of new low-wage workers to the workforce.  And there is a feeling that the world economy has brought a race to the bottom, where jobs are exported to lower-wage nations in an economy where the rules are fixed and the deck is stacked against the common man and woman, and in favor of financial establishments and elites who wield power over political and government establishments.  In both America and Europe there is the omnipresent threat of terrorism, which is related to the intense issue of immigration. To complicate matters further, Russian strongman Vladimir Putin has become increasingly aggressive, and the more Europe becomes divided the greater the danger from Putin, who would gain strength from a European breakup.  Finally, there is a widespread feeling that events have spun out of control, that national sovereignty has lost its meaning, that events are in the saddle and riding mankind.  Throughout Europe these sentiments have incited enormous anger against establishments of all kinds that motivates both the left and the right and has increasing appeal to the center.
