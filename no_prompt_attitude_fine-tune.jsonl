Peter Leary is the Canon Murray Fellow in Irish History at Oxford University, and will soon release his book 'Unapproved routes: Histories of the Irish border, 1922-72', which explores issues of state and identify while looking at the impact the border had on everyday life in the region.

Even after partition, nobody sat down and thought 'let us create a customs barrier' but once the border was in place it became an unintended consequence of diverging tax regimes.  \\\\\\\"Clearly a Brexit would bring back or 'harden' the border on some level, probably in small ways at first. But we could be talking less about what we might see immediately, than about how relationships between Britain and Ireland, Britain and Europe, and North and South might then evolve over ten, or twenty, or thirty years or more.\\\\\\\"  Mr Leary added the people of Fermanagh have always found a way of coping, though, showing \\\\\\\"great creativity in finding ways to make do and even sometimes turn it to their own advantage.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Smuggling was, of course, the best known example of this,\\\\\\\" he said. \\\\\\\"But that was always about making the best of often very difficult circumstances.\\\\\\\"  Advertisement  Related posts: No related posts.", "output": "{\"topical_attitudes\": [{\"source\": {\"entity\": \"Peter Leary\", \"references\": [\"Peter Leary\"]}, \"target\": {\"topic\": \"Brexit\", \"references\": [\"Brexit\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"Clearly a Brexit would bring back or 'harden' the border on some level, probably in small ways at first.\"], \"attitude\": \"Negative\"}, {\"source\": {\"entity\": \"Peter Leary\", \"references\": [\"Peter Leary\"]}, \"target\": {\"topic\": \"Irish border\", \"references\": [\"border\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"The border was not something that many, if anyone, on either side wanted or expected.\", \"Once the border was in place it became an unintended consequence of diverging tax regimes.\"], \"attitude\": \"Negative\"}, {\"source\": {\"entity\": \"Peter Leary\", \"references\": [\"Peter Leary\"]}, \"target\": {\"topic\": \"historical impact of the Irish border\", \"references\": [\"impact the border had on everyday life in the region\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"which explores issues of state and identity while looking at the impact the border had on everyday life in the region.\"], \"attitude\": \"Neutral\"}, {\"source\": {\"entity\": \"Peter Leary\", \"references\": [\"Peter Leary\"]}, \"target\": {\"topic\": \"emotional experience of the border\", \"references\": [\"emotional experience of dislocation\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"there was also an emotional experience of dislocation, a sense of being set apart from familiar places and people.\"], \"attitude\": \"Negative\"}, {\"source\": {\"entity\": \"Peter Leary\", \"references\": [\"Peter Leary\"]}, \"target\": {\"topic\": \"smuggling\", \"references\": [\"Smuggling\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"Smuggling was, of course, the best known example of this.\"], \"attitude\": \"Neutral\"}, {\"source\": {\"entity\": \"Peter Leary\", \"references\": [\"Peter Leary\"]}, \"target\": {\"topic\": \"creativity of the people of Fermanagh\", \"references\": [\"great creativity in finding ways to make do\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"the people of Fermanagh have always found a way of coping, though, showing great creativity in finding ways to make do.\"], \"attitude\": \"Positive\"}], \"entity_attitudes\": [{\"entity1\": {\"entity\": \"Peter Leary\", \"references\": [\"Peter Leary\"]}, \"entity2\": {\"entity\": \"Phillip Callahan\", \"references\": [\"Phillip Callahan\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"One wartime observer, Phillip Callahan, who served in the US Army Air Forces near Belleek, described it as 'one of the worst examples of frontier bureaucracy in existence.'\"], \"attitude\": \"Neutral\"}]}"}
{"instruction": "Extract attitudes from the article in JSON format", "input": "'I believe that this Thursday can be our country's Independence Day'  Leading proponents of the \\\\\\\"Leave\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"Remain\\\\\\\" campaigns sparred in a final televised debate before Britain will vote on whether it will remain in the European Union.  Those in favor of \\\\\\\"Brexit\\\\\\\"-Britain's exit from the EU-emphasized the need for the United Kingdom to take back control of its economy and borders, while those who want to remain in the Union warned British citizens that exiting would be a \\\\\\\"one-way leap into the dark,\\\\\\\" with potentially devastating economic implications.  Boris Johnson, London's former mayor, a member of the Conservative Party, and a leading proponent of the campaign to leave the EU, clashed with his successor Sadiq Khan, a member of the Labour Party, over the economy, immigration, and Britain's role on the international stage.  Britain's possible exit from the EU has garnered warnings from world leaders, including President Obama. British Prime Minister David Cameron has also vocally opposed Brexit, telling voters in a last-ditch appeal Tuesday to consider the ramifications for future generations of an exit from the EU.  Members of the \\\\\\\"Remain\\\\\\\" campaign made similar arguments during the nearly two-hour live television debate on Tuesday evening, the last of its kind before British citizens will vote in the referendum on Thursday. Khan, along with Ruth Davidson, leader of the Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party, and Frances O'Grady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, characterized exiting the EU as a gamble that could have grave economic and rights implications. He accused the Leave campaign of not having a plan in place to guide Britain in a post-Brexit world.  \\\\\\\"You want the British public to take a one-way leap into the dark without a plan,\\\\\\\" said Khan during the debate, which featured questions from a roughly 6,000-person strong audience split evenly between supporters of each campaign.  \\\\\\\"I know the EU is not perfect, but the benefits far outweigh any costs,\\\\\\\" Davidson explained during closing remarks. \\\\\\\"The Britain that I know works with its neighbors. It does not walk away from them.\\\\\\\" Davidson said British citizens would not be able to reverse a decision to leave the EU.  These claims were rejected by Brexit proponents. Johnson, Labour member of Parliament Gisela Stuart, and Conservative energy minister Andrea Leadsom all expressed confidence that a Britain untethered from the EU could write its own trade agreements, control its borders, and shed EU laws and regulations.  \\\\\\\"We do not need unelected, bureaucratic European leaders \\\\u2026 to tell us what our rights should be,\\\\\\\" said Leadsom. \\\\\\\"We should take back control and look after our own society.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"They say we can not do it; we say we can. They say we have no choice but to bow down to Brussels; we say that they are woefully underestimating this country and what we can do,\\\\\\\" Johnson said. \\\\\\\"I believe that this Thursday can be our country's Independence Day.\\\\\\\"  Both sides accused the other of resorting to scare tactics in order to sell their positions to the public.  The British public is split on whether the United Kingdom should remain in the EU, according to polling tracked by the Economist since the campaigns for and against Brexit officially launched in mid-April. As of Monday, 44 percent of voters wanted to remain in the EU, while 43 percent favored Brexit.

Published 12:00 am Wednesday, June 22, 2016  \\\\\\\"I wish to speak to you today about the tragedy of Europe,\\\\\\\" Winston Churchill told his audience in 1946. But he wasn't speaking of a united Europe as a bad thing. Actually, he strongly supported the development of a European Union, and probably would not embrace \\\\\\\"Brexit,\\\\\\\" the decision of the United Kingdom to leave the EU, which will soon be in the hands of voters.  \\\\\\\"Let Europe Arise!\\\\\\\" former Prime Minister Churchill stated at a speech to the University of Zurich, which you can find in \\\\\\\"Vital Speeches of the Day\\\\\\\" published on Oct. 1, 1946 (you can also find it in the book The Sinews of Peace, under \\\\\\\"Post-War Speeches by Winston S. Churchill, published by Cassell & Company, Ltd. in 1948).  \\\\\\\"If Europe is to be saved from infinite misery and, indeed, from final doom, there must be this act of faith in the European family and this act of oblivion against all the crimes and follies of the past, and the free peoples of Europe must rise to the height of these resolves of the soul and of the instinct of the spirit of man,\\\\\\\" Churchill said.  And he wasn't some \\\\\\\"Britain First\\\\\\\" character like the assassin of British MP Jo Cox, where everything is about national sovereignty.  \\\\\\\"The structure of the United States of Europe, if well and truly built, will be such as to make the material strength of a single state less important,\\\\\\\" Churchill stated. \\\\\\\"Small nations will count as much as large ones and gain their honor by their contribution to the common cause.\\\\\\\"  Of course he did not like some of the specific plans of his day, namely the Treaty of Paris as well as the European Defense Community. But when he got back into office after his party lost parliament in 1945, he pushed hard for the West European Union.  \\\\\\\"If we are to form a United States of Europe, or whatever name it may take, we must begin now. \\\\u2026 Our constant aim must be to build and fortify the strength of the United Nations organization. Under and within that world concept, we must recreate the European family in a regional structure, called, it may be, the United States of Europe, and the first practical step would be to form a Council of Europe. If at first all states of Europe are not willing or able to join the union, we must nevertheless proceed to assemble and combine those who will and can.\\\\\\\"  I am sure there are some who would say that things are different now than in Churchill's time, with Middle East refugees. But the great British Prime Minister knew that xenophobia and hatred of others was what led to the need for a stronger Europe to combat these in the first place.  \\\\\\\"It is from Europe that has sprung that series of frightful and nationalistic morals originated by the Teutonic nations in their rise to power, which we have seen in the 20th century and which have for a long time wrecked the peace and marred the prospects of all mankind,\\\\\\\" Churchill told the people.  He also credited \\\\\\\"that great republic across the Atlantic Ocean has at length realized that the ruin or enslavement of Europe has involved their own fate as well.\\\\\\\"  That's right - Churchill wanted the United States to play a strong role in helping foster a unified Europe. We need to study what Churchill said, beyond the Iron Curtain speech and catty comments to Lady Astor.  If we are so angry over a bust of him being allegedly removed from the White House - fact check it - we should listen to his words about what should be done in Europe.", "output": "{\"topical_attitudes\": [{\"source\": {\"entity\": \"Winston Churchill\", \"references\": [\"Winston Churchill\"]}, \"target\": {\"topic\": \"Brexit\", \"references\": [\"Brexit\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"he probably would not embrace 'Brexit', the decision of the United Kingdom to leave the EU\"], \"attitude\": \"Negative\"}, {\"source\": {\"entity\": \"Winston Churchill\", \"references\": [\"Winston Churchill\"]}, \"target\": {\"topic\": \"European Union\", \"references\": [\"development of a European Union\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"Actually, he strongly supported the development of a European Union\"], \"attitude\": \"Positive\"}, {\"source\": {\"entity\": \"Winston Churchill\", \"references\": [\"Winston Churchill\"]}, \"target\": {\"topic\": \"United States of Europe\", \"references\": [\"United States of Europe\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"The structure of the United States of Europe, if well and truly built, will be such as to make the material strength of a single state less important\", \"We must recreate the European family in a regional structure, called, it may be, the United States of Europe\"], \"attitude\": \"Positive\"}, {\"source\": {\"entity\": \"Winston Churchill\", \"references\": [\"Winston Churchill\"]}, \"target\": {\"topic\": \"xenophobia and hatred of others\", \"references\": [\"xenophobia and hatred of others\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"the great British Prime Minister knew that xenophobia and hatred of others was what led to the need for a stronger Europe to combat these\"], \"attitude\": \"Negative\"}], \"entity_attitudes\": [{\"entity1\": {\"entity\": \"Winston Churchill\", \"references\": [\"Winston Churchill\"]}, \"entity2\": {\"entity\": \"United Kingdom\", \"references\": [\"United Kingdom\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"he probably would not embrace 'Brexit', the decision of the United Kingdom to leave the EU\"], \"attitude\": \"Negative\"}, {\"entity1\": {\"entity\": \"Winston Churchill\", \"references\": [\"Winston Churchill\"]}, \"entity2\": {\"entity\": \"United States\", \"references\": [\"United States\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"Churchill wanted the United States to play a strong role in helping foster a unified Europe\"], \"attitude\": \"Positive\"}, {\"entity1\": {\"entity\": \"Winston Churchill\", \"references\": [\"Winston Churchill\"]}, \"entity2\": {\"entity\": \"Jo Cox\", \"references\": [\"assassin of British MP Jo Cox\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"he wasn't some 'Britain First' character like the assassin of British MP Jo Cox\"], \"attitude\": \"Negative\"}]}"}

What ho, Wonkists and Wonkastrians on both sides of the Atlantic! Are we steeling ourselves for potentially the second-greatest electoral mistake of 2016 tomorrow?  We are talking, of course, about the Brexit referendum Thursday, in which UK subjects will decide whether to listen to some Oxbridge Tories and free themselves from the bureaucratic shackles of the European Union, in favor of proper English shackles provided by these same Tories (plus a lot less money).  Polls are basically dead even on whether Great Britain will vote for a British Exit, or Brexit, from the 28-nation EU. Like the rise of the Donald Trump in America, this is a sign that nativist resentment is always a match for pointy-headed intellectual notions about so-called \\\\\\\"arithmetic\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\"history.\\\\\\\" Most economists reckon Britain would be the poorer for leaving the EU, and the precedent would be a setback for the world economy (to say nothing of a continuation of 70 years of basically unprecedented peace between European nations), and could lead to a breakup of the UK itself when Scotland...  Wait, wait, wait, HEY! Where are you going? Look, we know that you, dear reader, have important naked Sara Benincasa movies to watch, so we will let you do your own research on the ins and outs of British trade and immigration policy. We will just point out who is for and against Brexit, so that you can know whether your reaction to the referendum results should be \\\\\\\"Top hole!\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\"Hard luck!\\\\\\\"  Against leaving we have not only god-Emperor B.H. Obama and your nerd boyfriend Paul Krugman , but also John Oliver, America's favorite teacup Englishman. Oliver acknowledges that few things put the British knicker in a twist more than a Belgian bureaucrat, but points out that most arguments in favor of leaving the EU are based on bullshit or simple racism.  [wonkbar]<a href=\\\\\\\"https: //wonkette.substack.com/p/british-member-of-parliament-jo-cox-murdered-american-gun-nuts-have-a-good-larf\\\\\\\"></a>[/wonkbar]Leading the Brexit push ( aside from deranged murderers ) are some members of the ruling Conservative Party, or Tories. Tory Prime Minister David Cameron came up with the brilliant plan of holding a vote, although he's against leaving the EU (he just wants a bunch of special rules for the UK). Alongside the pro-Brexit Tories you have the U.K. Independence Party (UKIP), a group that thinks the problem with thinly veiled racism is the unnecessary veil.

{"instruction": "Extract attitudes from the article in JSON format", "input": "Participants hold a British Union flag and an EU flag during a pro-EU referendum event at Parliament Square in London Thomson Reuters  By David Lawder and Howard Schneider  Advertisement  WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A vote by Britons to leave the European Union on Thursday may not drag the United States into recession, but its effects on U.S. monetary policy, trade and corporate profits are causing concern in Washington D.C. and boardrooms alike.  Market volatility in the immediate aftermath of such an unprecedented decision would likely drive down the British pound and push the U.S. dollar up, keeping Federal Reserve interest rate rises on hold for even longer as the damage is assessed and divorce terms are negotiated with the EU.  Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen on Tuesday repeated the U.S. central bank's concerns over the \\\\\\\"Brexit\\\\\\\" vote, telling lawmakers it could have \\\\\\\"significant economic repercussions\\\\\\\", including a flight to the safety of dollar assets that would push up the dollar and further slow U.S. exports.  Britain, the world's fifth largest economy, is the seventh largest U.S. trading partner, with $56 billion in U.S. goods exports to Britain and $58 billion in imports from the UK in 2015.  Advertisement  Aircraft and aircraft engines are the biggest U.S. exports to Britain, while cars and trucks are the largest U.S. imports from the UK, with two-way pharmaceuticals trade important for both countries.  More than half of Britain's exports go to Europe though, where a vote to leave the EU could put it at a disadvantage.  Leaving the EU would cost Britain its privileged free trading status with the continent, throwing up problems for multinational companies with British operations, including higher tariffs on UK-produced cars and engines as well as uncertainty over how banks and insurers in the London financial hub can operate in Europe.  The United Kingdom also would be excluded from EU free trade agreements with other countries, such as those with Canada, Mexico and South Korea. The EU currently has Preferential Trade Agreements with 52 countries and is negotiating agreements with another 72.  Advertisement  A massive trans-Atlantic trade deal under negotiation with the United States would also be in jeopardy. President Barack Obama has warned it could be years before Washington is ready to start talks on a bilateral deal with Britain.  \\\\\\\"We think a strong UK in a strong and unified European Union is in everybody's interest,\\\\\\\" U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman said on Tuesday. \\\\\\\"We think their voice is stronger as part of a larger entity.\\\\\\\"  It could take Britain up to two years to negotiate new trading and regulatory arrangements with Europe, creating a pall of uncertainty that will dampen trade and capital flows and put business decisions on hold, said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors in New York.  \\\\\\\"The likely outcome is more of a pause, an additional slowdown.

I do not know if it means 1,000 jobs, 2,000 jobs; it could be as many as 4,000,\\\\\\\" Dimon said.  Ford Motor Co , which has factories scattered across the UK and Europe, told employees in a letter on Monday that it could face tariffs of up to 2.7 percent on UK engine exports and 10 percent on vehicles, potentially costing \\\\\\\"hundreds of millions of dollars every year.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"This would significantly impact our business,\\\\\\\" Ford Britain Managing Director Andy Barratt wrote. Profits at Ford's European operations are just starting to return to pre-2008 crisis levels after years of losses and painful plant closures.  CHOCOLATE DIVERGENCE  Advertisement  Other firms that use Britain as an export base also worry about a gradual regulatory divergence between the UK and EU.  Mars Inc. Vice President for Public Affairs Matthias Berninger told Reuters that a post-Brexit Britain would likely want to set its own standards for food safety and chocolate or pet food ingredients, creating problems for a European production network optimized for efficiency over the past 40 years.  Moving employees between locations would be more problematic with new immigration restrictions that are being advocated by the \\\\\\\"leave\\\\\\\" camp, Mars Inc's Berninger added. A long-term deterioration of the pound would also eat into profit margins in the UK which is the M&Ms and Snickers maker's second-largest market worldwide.  \\\\\\\"All of those things are a headache that translates into costs that eat into profitability,\\\\\\\" Berninger said. \\\\\\\"It's a slow crash.\\\\\\\"  Advertisement  In choosing Britain as a base, U.S. companies often cite its more flexible labor market than the rest of Europe, the English language, the rule of law, and a creative culture, but without EU access, the appeal dims.  \\\\\\\"For us, EU membership is also a big reason why we have chosen Britain. Recent suggestions that the UK should leave the single market if it exits the EU are particularly concerning and potentially hugely damaging,\\\\\\\" wrote several corporate executives, including General Electric CEO Jeff Immelt, Cisco Systems Inc CEO Chuck Robbins, and Bloomberg LP chairman Michael Bloomberg in a letter published by the London Financial Times last month.

{"instruction": "Extract attitudes from the article in JSON format", "input": "Investors and markets around the world are on edge as Britain decides whether it will stay in the European Union. The uncertainty around the future of Europe as we know it sent markets tumbling last week, and the CBOE volatility index, a measure of investor fear, spiked.  Investors have significant positions in foreign funds these days. Over the last decade, investors poured $643 billion into world stock funds, while they pulled $834 billion out of U.S. stock funds, according to the Investment Company Institute's 2016 Fact Book. So they are naturally concerned about how the so-called Brexit could affect their portfolios.  Some investors have recently sold their foreign funds. \\\\\\\"Investors pulled $1.1 billion from U.K. equity funds in the week to yesterday, according to data from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. This was the fastest rate of withdrawals in 13 months,\\\\\\\" according to data from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. This was the fastest rate of withdrawals in 13 months,\\\\\\\" according to The Street.  But we know that the best returns come from staying invested long term. Those who sell out of the market today will have to decide when to get invested again, and history shows that by the time investors feel ready to get back in the market, they have often missed out on significant gains.  Do not let uncertainty hold you back  Often investors wait to see how things progress, but this assumes that eventually they will feel more certain about where the market's headed. The reality is that uncertainty is part of investing, just like it's part of life, and as investors, we have to come to terms with uncertainty if we hope to get ahead.  Even after Thursday's vote, there will still be uncertainty. If Britain votes to leave the E.U., there will be two years of negotiations on the terms of the separation. And even then, we will not know how Britain and the E.U. will do on their own. So if you need to be invested to reach your goals, then get invested. Do not let the uncertainty of a Brexit hold you back from doing the work you need to do to get ahead.  Invest in what you know now -- and adapt as markets change  Focus on what you know now. You know why you are invested and what you are trying to accomplish. For most of us, investing is not just about money, it's about having the freedom to live the life we want-to retire on our schedule, to give our kids the option to go to the college of their choice. These goals are not tied to the result of the British referendum.  You also know that over the long term-even through times of global crisis and political upheaval-investing in stocks has been the best way to make money. The volatility of stocks makes it tough to hold stocks long enough to benefit from their terrific long-term results, but if you stick it out, those gains can change your life.  Another thing you probably know is how different areas of the market have been performing lately and, long before the Brexit, Europe wasn't performing well. Most Europe funds and ETFs have been out of favor for some time now; the iShares MSCI Eurozone ETF (EZU) has lagged the S&P 500 for the last three years running, and my firm's Upgrading strategy has kept us out of these funds.  U.S. funds are currently in favor  Decades of academic research and a January 2016 Morningstar study have found that funds that have done well recently tend to continue to do well for the next few months or even years . At the moment, that means U.S. stock funds. And funds that have not performed well tend to remain out of favor for some time.

{"instruction": "Extract attitudes from the article in JSON format", "input": "James Pethokoukis of the American Enterprise Institute is - at least to this historian of Britain - one of the most readable and stimulating commentators on economic affairs out there today. His recent column on \\\\\\\"Is America Really in Decline? What We Can Learn from Britain\\\\\\\" raises a few points which shed some light on the declinist argument and on the case for Britain's exit from the European Union, or Brexit.  As Pethokoukis puts it, drawing on historian Robert Tombs, the so-called decline panic that Britain experienced in the post-1945 decades \\\\\\\"rests on two assumptions: First, Britain experienced a collapse in global influence and economic dynamism. Second, those results stemmed from 'long-standing failures' of the nation's core institutions.\\\\\\\"  Pethokoukis implies this was false. But a good bit of it is actually true. British influence in the world did decline precipitously after 1945, as British withdrawals from the eastern Mediterranean (1947) and East of Suez (1967-68) illustrate. Some of this decline resulted from the rise of the superpowers after 1945, who outmatched the U.K. There was nothing the U.K. could have done about this.  Loss of influence  Another and much more complicated problem was Britain's post-war economic weakness, which led directly to most of these withdrawals. In any case, this wasn't a panic: it felt like a loss of influence for the simple reason that it was a loss of influence.  Then there is Britain's post-war economic dynamism. Again, it is - to me - inarguable that Britain performed worse after 1945 than most of Western Europe. The question is why. It may, as Tombs implies, have been mere post-war catch-up. But it was likely more than that. Britain does seem to have suffered from union-induced overmanning and amateurism in sectors of British corporate management (car manufacturers spring to mind). Worse, after 1945, the U.K. went down the road of nationalization, currency controls and demand management, all of which tended to prioritize stability and vested interests over creative destruction and dynamism.  Pethokoukis is completely right, on the other hand, that this led to an assault on \\\\\\\"the nation's core institutions,\\\\\\\" which were taken to be stolid, stuck in the mud, and undynamic. The results can be seen if you look around any British town - all of which underwent an attack of architectural vandalism of the most Brutalist kind, in the belief that the large scale use of reinforced concerted was, ipso facto, modernizing and would somehow jolt the British psyche from its torpor.  More broadly, if there was a guiding theme in Britain between the early 1960s and the late 1990s, it was \\\\\\\"modernization.\\\\\\\" Of course, that term meant different things to different people - but by and large it meant more top-down control, relentless legislative fiddling, and, except during the Thatcher/Major era, an expanded state.  The U.S. is not the UK, but the comparison has its merits  This is not as far from the U.S. experience as Pethokoukis implies. We are not, fortunately, dwarfed by superpower competitors. On the other hand, there is near-peer China, a range of regional competitors, and we really have not won a war for 25 years. We are not at risk, right now, of a U.K.-style collapse, but we are on the back heel in Europe and the South China Sea, we are clearly doing far worse than that in the Middle East, and U.S. defense spending trends look a bit too much like those of the U.K. for comfort.

{"instruction": "Extract attitudes from the article in JSON format", "input": "calls for the U.S. to focus on domestic rebuilding (i.e., more domestic spending) have been echoed by current presidential candidates. The U.S. is showing some of the same centralizing trends that did Britain few favors in the post-war era - trends that, on the progressive side of politics, are accompanied by just the sort of critique of U.S. institutions that the U.K. experienced (find me, for example, a progressive who praises federalism or rejects government-run healthcare). In short, while I agree we are not the U.K., the comparison has its merits.  The EU is part centralizing hindrance, part distraction  And what of Brexit? One of the major arguments offered for British entry into the European Economic Community (as it then was), was that British industry needed the \\\\\\\"cold shower\\\\\\\" of greater competition to snap out of its tradition-induced torpor. This was nonsense: British industry (and British unions) had plenty of problems, but the answer wasn't the EU. It was better government policies. And today, while the U.K. - thanks in large part to the fact that it's kept the pound - still has a fair amount of freedom to make its own policies. EU membership is all about reducing that freedom. The EU today is partly a centralizing hindrance and partly, as it was in the 1960s, a distraction from focusing on substantive issues.  And besides, if anyone today needs a cold shower, as Pethokoukis's graphs imply, it's the continent. Britain and the U.S. could and should be doing better, but it's the EU that's really underperforming. Focusing on the EU as your best market is a bit like emphasizing selling into the British Empire in 1945: It's a declining, fissiparous market that still has imperial ambitions.  Britain suffered after World War II, in part, because it had had the Empire as a more or less captive market for too long.

By Jo Gilbert  When asked if there could be any merit from a leave result following tomorrow's referendum, the resounding voice from the trade is 'no'.  When asked if there could be any positive outcomes from a leave result following tomorrow's referendum, the resounding voice from the UK trade is 'no'.  But looking at the way the polls are at the moment, the trade might have to prepare itself for an unpopular result.  John McLaren, UK director of the Wine Institute of California, is asking the UK trade to look beyond the uncertainty-is-bad-for-business mantra and see the \\\\\\\"bigger picture\\\\\\\".  He said: \\\\\\\"There is a psychological barrier within EU to play the safe option, which means staying within the EU community. This can be limiting. I am more excited about the potential of developing relationships outside of Europe in terms of Canada and US.\\\\\\\"  While many are concerned about the immediate effects of a UK exit, including the damage to the exchange rate and the power of the pound, in his chat to Harpers, McLaren asked the trade to keep an open mind to the possibility of long-term benefits.  \\\\\\\"I think the danger is that most people with think about how it will affect next week's mortgage payments rather than what we could be achieving in five years time,\\\\\\\" he said.  \\\\\\\"I think leaving is the more interesting proposition. There is more potential in it for rapid change and advancement rather than the safe option which is next week to be back where we were before.\\\\\\\"  Tim North at Les Grands Chais de France, traders of wines and alcohols in France with strong UK connections, disagrees.  He says that the devil is in the - in this case, the unseen - detail.  \\\\\\\"There are so many unseen barriers to trade that people do not know about. At the moment the legalities on drinks labels are the same for the UK as the rest of Europe. If we leave and the legislation changes, then producers exporting to England would have to come up with two separate labels. I know many small French producers who would be very affected by the additional costs. This goes for the wider world too - including California,\\\\\\\" he said.  North also challenged the idea that leaving the EU would lead to Britain becoming more entrenched in a global market.  \\\\\\\"It's ridiculous to think you can turn the clock back to the way it was before. The world is changing. In terms of technology and communication, the world is becoming smaller. We need to be part of a bigger group if we want to thrive in the modern world.\\\\\\\"  McClaren went on to point out that from an external point of view, having a national identity separate from Europe would drive innovation in how products are tailored to the UK market.  He said: \\\\\\\"A lot of Americans like to think of Europe as a market, so they think the British must be same as the Germans. Only when they delve deeper do they realise there is big different between a French or German and British consumer.\\\\\\\"  He also argues that the deep rooted relationships between England and Europe's top producing wine countries, will ensure longevity.  \\\\\\\"If we leave, people will still buy the cars they want to buy and they will continue drink wine from France and Italy and Spain purely out of convenience, because they are so close, and because we have been doing it for decades. People in the wine business are some of the most traditional in the world.

(Photo: Fred Chartrand/CP)  In 2010, Canada competed in a three-way race with Germany and Portugal for two rotating slots on the UN Security Council. Germany was considered a shoo-in and won the necessary two-thirds of support on the first ballot, but Portugal surprised Canadian officials by coming in second, and increasing its support by a large margin during the second round of voting, after which Canada pulled out to avoid a further embarrassment.

Paul Heinbecker, Canada's ambassador to the UN from 2000 to 2003, told the CBC after the vote that the Conservatives' foreign policy - from decreasing African aid, to staunchly supporting Israel, to a lack of engagement on climate change and peacekeeping operations - had been unpopular with the international community.
