Peter Leary is the Canon Murray Fellow in Irish History at Oxford University, and will soon release his book 'Unapproved routes: Histories of the Irish border, 1922-72', which explores issues of state and identify while looking at the impact the border had on everyday life in the region.

Even after partition, nobody sat down and thought 'let us create a customs barrier' but once the border was in place it became an unintended consequence of diverging tax regimes.  \\\\\\\"Clearly a Brexit would bring back or 'harden' the border on some level, probably in small ways at first. But we could be talking less about what we might see immediately, than about how relationships between Britain and Ireland, Britain and Europe, and North and South might then evolve over ten, or twenty, or thirty years or more.\\\\\\\"  Mr Leary added the people of Fermanagh have always found a way of coping, though, showing \\\\\\\"great creativity in finding ways to make do and even sometimes turn it to their own advantage.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Smuggling was, of course, the best known example of this,\\\\\\\" he said. \\\\\\\"But that was always about making the best of often very difficult circumstances.\\\\\\\"  Advertisement  Related posts: No related posts.", "output": "{\"topical_attitudes\": [{\"source\": {\"entity\": \"Peter Leary\", \"references\": [\"Peter Leary\"]}, \"target\": {\"topic\": \"Brexit\", \"references\": [\"Brexit\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"Clearly a Brexit would bring back or 'harden' the border on some level, probably in small ways at first.\"], \"attitude\": \"Negative\"}, {\"source\": {\"entity\": \"Peter Leary\", \"references\": [\"Peter Leary\"]}, \"target\": {\"topic\": \"Irish border\", \"references\": [\"border\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"The border was not something that many, if anyone, on either side wanted or expected.\", \"Once the border was in place it became an unintended consequence of diverging tax regimes.\"], \"attitude\": \"Negative\"}, {\"source\": {\"entity\": \"Peter Leary\", \"references\": [\"Peter Leary\"]}, \"target\": {\"topic\": \"historical impact of the Irish border\", \"references\": [\"impact the border had on everyday life in the region\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"which explores issues of state and identity while looking at the impact the border had on everyday life in the region.\"], \"attitude\": \"Neutral\"}, {\"source\": {\"entity\": \"Peter Leary\", \"references\": [\"Peter Leary\"]}, \"target\": {\"topic\": \"emotional experience of the border\", \"references\": [\"emotional experience of dislocation\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"there was also an emotional experience of dislocation, a sense of being set apart from familiar places and people.\"], \"attitude\": \"Negative\"}, {\"source\": {\"entity\": \"Peter Leary\", \"references\": [\"Peter Leary\"]}, \"target\": {\"topic\": \"smuggling\", \"references\": [\"Smuggling\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"Smuggling was, of course, the best known example of this.\"], \"attitude\": \"Neutral\"}, {\"source\": {\"entity\": \"Peter Leary\", \"references\": [\"Peter Leary\"]}, \"target\": {\"topic\": \"creativity of the people of Fermanagh\", \"references\": [\"great creativity in finding ways to make do\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"the people of Fermanagh have always found a way of coping, though, showing great creativity in finding ways to make do.\"], \"attitude\": \"Positive\"}], \"entity_attitudes\": [{\"entity1\": {\"entity\": \"Peter Leary\", \"references\": [\"Peter Leary\"]}, \"entity2\": {\"entity\": \"Phillip Callahan\", \"references\": [\"Phillip Callahan\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"One wartime observer, Phillip Callahan, who served in the US Army Air Forces near Belleek, described it as 'one of the worst examples of frontier bureaucracy in existence.'\"], \"attitude\": \"Neutral\"}]}"}

Those in favor of \\\\\\\"Brexit\\\\\\\"-Britain's exit from the EU-emphasized the need for the United Kingdom to take back control of its economy and borders, while those who want to remain in the Union warned British citizens that exiting would be a \\\\\\\"one-way leap into the dark,\\\\\\\" with potentially devastating economic implications.  Boris Johnson, London's former mayor, a member of the Conservative Party, and a leading proponent of the campaign to leave the EU, clashed with his successor Sadiq Khan, a member of the Labour Party, over the economy, immigration, and Britain's role on the international stage.  Britain's possible exit from the EU has garnered warnings from world leaders, including President Obama. British Prime Minister David Cameron has also vocally opposed Brexit, telling voters in a last-ditch appeal Tuesday to consider the ramifications for future generations of an exit from the EU.  Members of the \\\\\\\"Remain\\\\\\\" campaign made similar arguments during the nearly two-hour live television debate on Tuesday evening, the last of its kind before British citizens will vote in the referendum on Thursday. Khan, along with Ruth Davidson, leader of the Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party, and Frances O'Grady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, characterized exiting the EU as a gamble that could have grave economic and rights implications. He accused the Leave campaign of not having a plan in place to guide Britain in a post-Brexit world.  \\\\\\\"You want the British public to take a one-way leap into the dark without a plan,\\\\\\\" said Khan during the debate, which featured questions from a roughly 6,000-person strong audience split evenly between supporters of each campaign.  \\\\\\\"I know the EU is not perfect, but the benefits far outweigh any costs,\\\\\\\" Davidson explained during closing remarks. \\\\\\\"The Britain that I know works with its neighbors. It does not walk away from them.\\\\\\\" Davidson said British citizens would not be able to reverse a decision to leave the EU.  These claims were rejected by Brexit proponents. Johnson, Labour member of Parliament Gisela Stuart, and Conservative energy minister Andrea Leadsom all expressed confidence that a Britain untethered from the EU could write its own trade agreements, control its borders, and shed EU laws and regulations.  \\\\\\\"We do not need unelected, bureaucratic European leaders \\\\u2026 to tell us what our rights should be,\\\\\\\" said Leadsom. \\\\\\\"We should take back control and look after our own society.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"They say we can not do it; we say we can. They say we have no choice but to bow down to Brussels; we say that they are woefully underestimating this country and what we can do,\\\\\\\" Johnson said. \\\\\\\"I believe that this Thursday can be our country's Independence Day.\\\\\\\"  Both sides accused the other of resorting to scare tactics in order to sell their positions to the public.  The British public is split on whether the United Kingdom should remain in the EU, according to polling tracked by the Economist since the campaigns for and against Brexit officially launched in mid-April. As of Monday, 44 percent of voters wanted to remain in the EU, while 43 percent favored Brexit.

Published 12:00 am Wednesday, June 22, 2016  \\\\\\\"I wish to speak to you today about the tragedy of Europe,\\\\\\\" Winston Churchill told his audience in 1946. But he wasn't speaking of a united Europe as a bad thing. Actually, he strongly supported the development of a European Union, and probably would not embrace \\\\\\\"Brexit,\\\\\\\" the decision of the United Kingdom to leave the EU, which will soon be in the hands of voters.  \\\\\\\"Let Europe Arise!\\\\\\\" former Prime Minister Churchill stated at a speech to the University of Zurich, which you can find in \\\\\\\"Vital Speeches of the Day\\\\\\\" published on Oct. 1, 1946 (you can also find it in the book The Sinews of Peace, under \\\\\\\"Post-War Speeches by Winston S. Churchill, published by Cassell & Company, Ltd. in 1948).  \\\\\\\"If Europe is to be saved from infinite misery and, indeed, from final doom, there must be this act of faith in the European family and this act of oblivion against all the crimes and follies of the past, and the free peoples of Europe must rise to the height of these resolves of the soul and of the instinct of the spirit of man,\\\\\\\" Churchill said.  And he wasn't some \\\\\\\"Britain First\\\\\\\" character like the assassin of British MP Jo Cox, where everything is about national sovereignty.  \\\\\\\"The structure of the United States of Europe, if well and truly built, will be such as to make the material strength of a single state less important,\\\\\\\" Churchill stated. \\\\\\\"Small nations will count as much as large ones and gain their honor by their contribution to the common cause.\\\\\\\"  Of course he did not like some of the specific plans of his day, namely the Treaty of Paris as well as the European Defense Community. But when he got back into office after his party lost parliament in 1945, he pushed hard for the West European Union.  \\\\\\\"If we are to form a United States of Europe, or whatever name it may take, we must begin now. \\\\u2026 Our constant aim must be to build and fortify the strength of the United Nations organization. Under and within that world concept, we must recreate the European family in a regional structure, called, it may be, the United States of Europe, and the first practical step would be to form a Council of Europe. If at first all states of Europe are not willing or able to join the union, we must nevertheless proceed to assemble and combine those who will and can.\\\\\\\"  I am sure there are some who would say that things are different now than in Churchill's time, with Middle East refugees. But the great British Prime Minister knew that xenophobia and hatred of others was what led to the need for a stronger Europe to combat these in the first place.  \\\\\\\"It is from Europe that has sprung that series of frightful and nationalistic morals originated by the Teutonic nations in their rise to power, which we have seen in the 20th century and which have for a long time wrecked the peace and marred the prospects of all mankind,\\\\\\\" Churchill told the people.  He also credited \\\\\\\"that great republic across the Atlantic Ocean has at length realized that the ruin or enslavement of Europe has involved their own fate as well.\\\\\\\"  That's right - Churchill wanted the United States to play a strong role in helping foster a unified Europe. We need to study what Churchill said, beyond the Iron Curtain speech and catty comments to Lady Astor.  If we are so angry over a bust of him being allegedly removed from the White House - fact check it - we should listen to his words about what should be done in Europe.", "output": "{\"topical_attitudes\": [{\"source\": {\"entity\": \"Winston Churchill\", \"references\": [\"Winston Churchill\"]}, \"target\": {\"topic\": \"Brexit\", \"references\": [\"Brexit\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"he probably would not embrace 'Brexit', the decision of the United Kingdom to leave the EU\"], \"attitude\": \"Negative\"}, {\"source\": {\"entity\": \"Winston Churchill\", \"references\": [\"Winston Churchill\"]}, \"target\": {\"topic\": \"European Union\", \"references\": [\"development of a European Union\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"Actually, he strongly supported the development of a European Union\"], \"attitude\": \"Positive\"}, {\"source\": {\"entity\": \"Winston Churchill\", \"references\": [\"Winston Churchill\"]}, \"target\": {\"topic\": \"United States of Europe\", \"references\": [\"United States of Europe\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"The structure of the United States of Europe, if well and truly built, will be such as to make the material strength of a single state less important\", \"We must recreate the European family in a regional structure, called, it may be, the United States of Europe\"], \"attitude\": \"Positive\"}, {\"source\": {\"entity\": \"Winston Churchill\", \"references\": [\"Winston Churchill\"]}, \"target\": {\"topic\": \"xenophobia and hatred of others\", \"references\": [\"xenophobia and hatred of others\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"the great British Prime Minister knew that xenophobia and hatred of others was what led to the need for a stronger Europe to combat these\"], \"attitude\": \"Negative\"}], \"entity_attitudes\": [{\"entity1\": {\"entity\": \"Winston Churchill\", \"references\": [\"Winston Churchill\"]}, \"entity2\": {\"entity\": \"United Kingdom\", \"references\": [\"United Kingdom\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"he probably would not embrace 'Brexit', the decision of the United Kingdom to leave the EU\"], \"attitude\": \"Negative\"}, {\"entity1\": {\"entity\": \"Winston Churchill\", \"references\": [\"Winston Churchill\"]}, \"entity2\": {\"entity\": \"United States\", \"references\": [\"United States\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"Churchill wanted the United States to play a strong role in helping foster a unified Europe\"], \"attitude\": \"Positive\"}, {\"entity1\": {\"entity\": \"Winston Churchill\", \"references\": [\"Winston Churchill\"]}, \"entity2\": {\"entity\": \"Jo Cox\", \"references\": [\"assassin of British MP Jo Cox\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"he wasn't some 'Britain First' character like the assassin of British MP Jo Cox\"], \"attitude\": \"Negative\"}]}"}

Aside from the peace and prosperity?  What ho, Wonkists and Wonkastrians on both sides of the Atlantic! Are we steeling ourselves for potentially the second-greatest electoral mistake of 2016 tomorrow?  We are talking, of course, about the Brexit referendum Thursday, in which UK subjects will decide whether to listen to some Oxbridge Tories and free themselves from the bureaucratic shackles of the European Union, in favor of proper English shackles provided by these same Tories (plus a lot less money).  Polls are basically dead even on whether Great Britain will vote for a British Exit, or Brexit, from the 28-nation EU. Like the rise of the Donald Trump in America, this is a sign that nativist resentment is always a match for pointy-headed intellectual notions about so-called \\\\\\\"arithmetic\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\"history.\\\\\\\" Most economists reckon Britain would be the poorer for leaving the EU, and the precedent would be a setback for the world economy (to say nothing of a continuation of 70 years of basically unprecedented peace between European nations), and could lead to a breakup of the UK itself when Scotland...  Wait, wait, wait, HEY! Where are you going? Look, we know that you, dear reader, have important naked Sara Benincasa movies to watch, so we will let you do your own research on the ins and outs of British trade and immigration policy. We will just point out who is for and against Brexit, so that you can know whether your reaction to the referendum results should be \\\\\\\"Top hole!\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\"Hard luck!\\\\\\\"  Against leaving we have not only god-Emperor B.H. Obama and your nerd boyfriend Paul Krugman , but also John Oliver, America's favorite teacup Englishman.

[wonkbar]<a href=\\\\\\\"https: //wonkette.substack.com/p/british-member-of-parliament-jo-cox-murdered-american-gun-nuts-have-a-good-larf\\\\\\\"></a>[/wonkbar]Leading the Brexit push ( aside from deranged murderers ) are some members of the ruling Conservative Party, or Tories. Tory Prime Minister David Cameron came up with the brilliant plan of holding a vote, although he's against leaving the EU (he just wants a bunch of special rules for the UK). Alongside the pro-Brexit Tories you have the U.K. Independence Party (UKIP), a group that thinks the problem with thinly veiled racism is the unnecessary veil.  One of their main reasons for leaving the EU would be reducing immigration into the UK, eliminating the freedom of travel and work across borders that is one of the EU's main selling points. The other is a mostly crap, but popular belief that Britain sends too much money to \\\\\\\"those people,\\\\\\\" basically the reasoning behind all those dumb new cities in Atlanta that white people create so they can avoid paying for roads in black neighborhoods.  But most importantly, one of the main proponents of Brexit is this fucking prick , former London mayor Boris Johnson.    He's much smarter than Trump, so what's his excuse?

Market volatility in the immediate aftermath of such an unprecedented decision would likely drive down the British pound and push the U.S. dollar up, keeping Federal Reserve interest rate rises on hold for even longer as the damage is assessed and divorce terms are negotiated with the EU.  Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen on Tuesday repeated the U.S. central bank's concerns over the \\\\\\\"Brexit\\\\\\\" vote, telling lawmakers it could have \\\\\\\"significant economic repercussions\\\\\\\", including a flight to the safety of dollar assets that would push up the dollar and further slow U.S. exports.  Britain, the world's fifth largest economy, is the seventh largest U.S. trading partner, with $56 billion in U.S. goods exports to Britain and $58 billion in imports from the UK in 2015.  Advertisement  Aircraft and aircraft engines are the biggest U.S. exports to Britain, while cars and trucks are the largest U.S. imports from the UK, with two-way pharmaceuticals trade important for both countries.  More than half of Britain's exports go to Europe though, where a vote to leave the EU could put it at a disadvantage.  Leaving the EU would cost Britain its privileged free trading status with the continent, throwing up problems for multinational companies with British operations, including higher tariffs on UK-produced cars and engines as well as uncertainty over how banks and insurers in the London financial hub can operate in Europe.  The United Kingdom also would be excluded from EU free trade agreements with other countries, such as those with Canada, Mexico and South Korea. The EU currently has Preferential Trade Agreements with 52 countries and is negotiating agreements with another 72.  Advertisement  A massive trans-Atlantic trade deal under negotiation with the United States would also be in jeopardy. President Barack Obama has warned it could be years before Washington is ready to start talks on a bilateral deal with Britain.  \\\\\\\"We think a strong UK in a strong and unified European Union is in everybody's interest,\\\\\\\" U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman said on Tuesday. \\\\\\\"We think their voice is stronger as part of a larger entity.\\\\\\\"  It could take Britain up to two years to negotiate new trading and regulatory arrangements with Europe, creating a pall of uncertainty that will dampen trade and capital flows and put business decisions on hold, said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors in New York.  \\\\\\\"The likely outcome is more of a pause, an additional slowdown. What are economies struggling with? Global demand is low, trade is low. Growth is slow. None of this will help that,\\\\\\\" he added.

London School of Economics researchers recently estimated that investment flows into Britain could fall as much as 22 percent as companies, including American firms, move operations elsewhere or put plans on hold in the wake of a leave vote.

{"instruction": "Extract attitudes between entities and topics from the article in json format and categorize them [Positive, Neutral, Negative] and justify them quoting the article", "input": "James Pethokoukis of the American Enterprise Institute is - at least to this historian of Britain - one of the most readable and stimulating commentators on economic affairs out there today. His recent column on \\\\\\\"Is America Really in Decline? What We Can Learn from Britain\\\\\\\" raises a few points which shed some light on the declinist argument and on the case for Britain's exit from the European Union, or Brexit.  As Pethokoukis puts it, drawing on historian Robert Tombs, the so-called decline panic that Britain experienced in the post-1945 decades \\\\\\\"rests on two assumptions: First, Britain experienced a collapse in global influence and economic dynamism. Second, those results stemmed from 'long-standing failures' of the nation's core institutions.\\\\\\\"  Pethokoukis implies this was false. But a good bit of it is actually true. British influence in the world did decline precipitously after 1945, as British withdrawals from the eastern Mediterranean (1947) and East of Suez (1967-68) illustrate. Some of this decline resulted from the rise of the superpowers after 1945, who outmatched the U.K. There was nothing the U.K. could have done about this.  Loss of influence  Another and much more complicated problem was Britain's post-war economic weakness, which led directly to most of these withdrawals. In any case, this wasn't a panic: it felt like a loss of influence for the simple reason that it was a loss of influence.  Then there is Britain's post-war economic dynamism. Again, it is - to me - inarguable that Britain performed worse after 1945 than most of Western Europe. The question is why. It may, as Tombs implies, have been mere post-war catch-up. But it was likely more than that. Britain does seem to have suffered from union-induced overmanning and amateurism in sectors of British corporate management (car manufacturers spring to mind). Worse, after 1945, the U.K. went down the road of nationalization, currency controls and demand management, all of which tended to prioritize stability and vested interests over creative destruction and dynamism.  Pethokoukis is completely right, on the other hand, that this led to an assault on \\\\\\\"the nation's core institutions,\\\\\\\" which were taken to be stolid, stuck in the mud, and undynamic. The results can be seen if you look around any British town - all of which underwent an attack of architectural vandalism of the most Brutalist kind, in the belief that the large scale use of reinforced concerted was, ipso facto, modernizing and would somehow jolt the British psyche from its torpor.  More broadly, if there was a guiding theme in Britain between the early 1960s and the late 1990s, it was \\\\\\\"modernization.\\\\\\\" Of course, that term meant different things to different people - but by and large it meant more top-down control, relentless legislative fiddling, and, except during the Thatcher/Major era, an expanded state.  The U.S. is not the UK, but the comparison has its merits  This is not as far from the U.S. experience as Pethokoukis implies. We are not, fortunately, dwarfed by superpower competitors. On the other hand, there is near-peer China, a range of regional competitors, and we really have not won a war for 25 years. We are not at risk, right now, of a U.K.-style collapse, but we are on the back heel in Europe and the South China Sea, we are clearly doing far worse than that in the Middle East, and U.S. defense spending trends look a bit too much like those of the U.K. for comfort.

By Jo Gilbert  When asked if there could be any merit from a leave result following tomorrow's referendum, the resounding voice from the trade is 'no'.  When asked if there could be any positive outcomes from a leave result following tomorrow's referendum, the resounding voice from the UK trade is 'no'.  But looking at the way the polls are at the moment, the trade might have to prepare itself for an unpopular result.  John McLaren, UK director of the Wine Institute of California, is asking the UK trade to look beyond the uncertainty-is-bad-for-business mantra and see the \\\\\\\"bigger picture\\\\\\\".  He said: \\\\\\\"There is a psychological barrier within EU to play the safe option, which means staying within the EU community. This can be limiting. I am more excited about the potential of developing relationships outside of Europe in terms of Canada and US.\\\\\\\"  While many are concerned about the immediate effects of a UK exit, including the damage to the exchange rate and the power of the pound, in his chat to Harpers, McLaren asked the trade to keep an open mind to the possibility of long-term benefits.  \\\\\\\"I think the danger is that most people with think about how it will affect next week's mortgage payments rather than what we could be achieving in five years time,\\\\\\\" he said.  \\\\\\\"I think leaving is the more interesting proposition. There is more potential in it for rapid change and advancement rather than the safe option which is next week to be back where we were before.\\\\\\\"  Tim North at Les Grands Chais de France, traders of wines and alcohols in France with strong UK connections, disagrees.  He says that the devil is in the - in this case, the unseen - detail.  \\\\\\\"There are so many unseen barriers to trade that people do not know about. At the moment the legalities on drinks labels are the same for the UK as the rest of Europe. If we leave and the legislation changes, then producers exporting to England would have to come up with two separate labels. I know many small French producers who would be very affected by the additional costs. This goes for the wider world too - including California,\\\\\\\" he said.  North also challenged the idea that leaving the EU would lead to Britain becoming more entrenched in a global market.  \\\\\\\"It's ridiculous to think you can turn the clock back to the way it was before. The world is changing. In terms of technology and communication, the world is becoming smaller.

Calgary Forest Lawn MP Deepak Obhrai, the parliamentary secretary for foreign affairs from 2006 to 2015, laid the blame for the Tories' embarrassing lost at the UN firmly at the foot of the EU Tuesday.

(Photo: Fred Chartrand/CP)  In 2010, Canada competed in a three-way race with Germany and Portugal for two rotating slots on the UN Security Council. Germany was considered a shoo-in and won the necessary two-thirds of support on the first ballot, but Portugal surprised Canadian officials by coming in second, and increasing its support by a large margin during the second round of voting, after which Canada pulled out to avoid a further embarrassment.

That is threatening our interests,\\\\\\\" Obhrai said.  \\\\\\\"Britain's exit from the EU will help small countries like Canada.\\\\\\\"  A referendum will be held Thursday to determine if Britain should remain part of the EU.  \\\\\\\"Britain's exit from the EU will help small countries like Canada.\\\\\\\" - Conservative MP Deepak Obhrai  Obhrai dismissed suggestions Canada had lost because of its pro-Israel voting record, and cuts to the development aid budget that affected African countries in particular.  \\\\\\\"No,\\\\\\\" he said firmly. \\\\\\\"I campaigned\\\\u2026 We were giving money to Africa and everywhere, through multilateral institutions and we had countries of focus.\\\\\\\"  Perhaps, the Arab states did not appreciated the country's support for Israel, but they were only one bloc, Obhrai said.

Paul Heinbecker, Canada's ambassador to the UN from 2000 to 2003, told the CBC after the vote that the Conservatives' foreign policy - from decreasing African aid, to staunchly supporting Israel, to a lack of engagement on climate change and peacekeeping operations - had been unpopular with the international community.

It comes after the Ukip leader was accused of adopting Nazi style propaganda tactics to help win the EU referendum. The poster Mr Farage unveiled showed refugees on the Slovenian border - part of Europe's passport-free Schengen area.  Next to the billboard was the headline \\\\\\\"Breaking Point\\\\\\\" and underneath it \\\\\\\"the EU has failed us all\\\\\\\".  When asked if he had apologised for the controversial billboard - as one Ukip MEP claimed during the television BBC debate on Tuesday - Mr Farage responded after his speech: \\\\\\\"I apologised for the timing\\\\u2026 but I can not apologise for the truth.\\\\\\\"  The SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon described the poster as \\\\\\\"disgusting\\\\\\\" while one of her MPs, Pete Wishard, also weighed in saying that a \\\\\\\"vote for leave is pretty much become a vote for petty xenophobia and anti-immigrant rhetoric\\\\\\\". American playwright Bonnie Greer, who has famously clashed with Mr Farage in the past, compared him to Nazi military leader Herman Goering.  George Osborne, the Chancellor, described it \\\\\\\"disgusting and vile\\\\\\\" and said it had \\\\\\\"echoes of literature used in the 1930s\\\\\\\".  Mr Farage also used his last major speech before voters head to the polls to cast their vote in the EU referendum to urge British people to vote with the \\\\\\\"heart\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"soul\\\\\\\". He added that voters could make Friday the UK's \\\\\\\"Independence Day\\\\\\\".  \\\\\\\"Let us stop pretending what this European project is,\\\\\\\" the Ukip leader said in his speech. \\\\\\\"They have an anthem, they are building an army, they have already got their own police force and of course they have got a flag.  \\\\\\\"At the end of the day tomorrow when people vote they must make a decision: which flag is theirs? I want, I want us to live under British passports and under the British flag.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Vote with your heart, vote with your soul, vote with pride in this country and its people and together we can make tomorrow our Independence Day - a big day in our national history.  Speaking to press from all over the world and Vote Leave supporters in Westminster, Mr Farage branded the EU \\\\\\\"a big business cartel\\\\\\\".  He said: \\\\\\\"We find ourselves, for the benefit of tariff-free trade, having to accept unlimited free movement of people. We find ourselves prohibited from making our own deals with the rest of the world.\\\\\\\"  Mr Farage accused Brussels of usurping control and sovereignty from the UK, and imposing EU law which \\\\\\\"is supreme\\\\\\\". His voice rising with passion and pulling out his passport from his jacket and waving it in front of the microphone - a signature move by the Ukip leader - he declared: \\\\\\\"We do not even have a British passport anymore\\\\\\\" - raising a clap from his supporters in the audience.

Read our privacy policy  Winston Churchill's delightful quote, \\\\\\\"the best argument against democracy is a five minute conversation with the average voter\\\\\\\" could never be more apposite when it comes to the EU referendum. Moreover, the average voter could be forgiven for replying, \\\\\\\"The best argument against democracy is a five-minute conversation with the average politician.\\\\\\\" What should have been an intelligent debate on the pros and cons of remaining in Europe has been dumbed down to a shouting match and desperate confirmation bias - the search and use of data to prove the point one believes in, coupled with an infinite capacity to ignore or refuse to listen to any counter arguments.  John Major came closest to presenting an honest case when he said that he was \\\\\\\"no starry eyed Europe enthusiast but had no doubt that the UK should remain in the EU\\\\\\\". The decision whether or not to remain hinges on making a large number of often complex trade-offs, ideally based on facts. I too have ended up firmly in favour of remaining.  Put simply, the Leave campaign has failed completely to convince me that the balance of advantage lies in quitting. No positive case has been made and no substantive counter arguments to the risks and uncertainties of leaving have been provided. Dismissing alternative points of view from credible independent experts as Cameron-sponsored collusion is schoolboy stuff and insulting to the average voter.  The Leave campaign now seems to be focusing on two issues: firstly, immigration - \\\\\\\"We need to control our borders\\\\\\\" - and secondly, sovereignty - \\\\\\\"We need to control our own laws\\\\\\\". They have lost the economic argument (more on that later). Moreover, their logic on immigration and sovereignty is fatally flawed and misleading.  Contrary to voter expectations, at no time has the Leave campaign argued that Brexit will result in lower immigration from the EU. Their rhetoric suggests they favour the prospect of an Australian-style points system to decide whom we would allow to enter the country. This is a seductive proposition but dangerously misleading when viewed in isolation or out of context. First, the statistical truth: 27.3 per cent of Australia's population is foreign born compared to 12.3 per cent in the UK. So what Leave is really saying is that the number of EU immigrants coming to the UK might not change with Brexit but that labour markets are inefficient and that Government is better placed to decide what skills we need and do not need. Putting aside my cynicism that Government knows better than employers with free access to EU labour skills, the facts do not support this case.  Employers thus far have done an excellent job at taking advantage of access to EU skills - and the UK as a country has benefited. 78 per cent of EU immigrants are in work in the UK compared to 73 per cent of the rest of the population. Moreover, the value of these immigrants to the UK economy is well documented by detailed research by Christian Dustmann, University College London (born in Herford, Germany) and Tomas Frattini, University of Milan (born in Bergamo, Italy), neither of whom can be dismissed as \\\\\\\"Remain stooges\\\\\\\".

Between 2001 and 2011, the net fiscal contribution of recent arrivals from the eastern European countries that have joined the EU since 2004 has amounted to almost \\\\u00a35bn. Even during the worst years of the financial crisis, in 2007-11, they made a net contribution of almost \\\\u00a32bn to British public finances. Migrants from other European countries chipped in \\\\u00a38.6bn.  In short, most EU migrants come here to work and add value to the UK economy. So what about the 22 per cent not working? Well, the UK government has already reached an agreement with the EU on out-of-work benefits. Newly arrived EU migrants are banned from claiming jobseekers' allowance for three months. If they have not found a job within six months they will be required to leave. EU migrant workers in the UK who lose their job, through no fault of their own, are entitled to the same benefits as UK citizens, including jobseekers' allowance and housing benefit, for six months. And by way of reminder, David Cameron secured concessions from the EU in his negotiations whereby access of newly arriving EU workers to non-contributory in-work benefits is limited for a total period of up to four years from the commencement of employment. David Cameron may have failed in his original demand to ban migrant workers from sending child benefit money back home but he successfully gained agreement that payments will instead be linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live. The new rules will apply immediately for new arrivals, and for existing claimants from 2020.  Leave campaigners also point to the impact of immigrants on wages and employment. First, let us dispel the argument often made that EU workers are low-skilled. EU employees in the UK are on average more highly educated than their UK peers. Only 15 per cent of EU employees left formal education before the age of 17 against 44 per cent of UK-born employees. More than 40 per cent of EU workers were educated beyond the age of 21 compared with less than a quarter of UK-born workers.  Law school professor's takedown of the Brexit argument goes viral  Moreover, there is little evidence that more migrants push wages down or unemployment up. Economists from the Centre for Economic Performance in School of Economics (also not Government lackeys) say that when they look at the areas with the largest increase in EU immigration, these have not seen the sharpest falls in employment or wages since 2008. Research published last year by the Office for Budget Responsibility suggested there was a small negative effect of migration on the wages of locals in the semi-skilled and unskilled service sector, such as care workers, shop assistants, restaurant and bar workers but the impact of migration on the wages of the UK-born in this sector since 2004 has been no more than 1 per cent over a period of eight years.  Finally, immigration is not a single issue debate. Significant economic issues are linked. If the UK wants future access to the EU Single Market, we will not be able to \\\\\\\"control our borders\\\\\\\". Free movement of people lies at the core of EU values alongside free access to EU markets. The Leave campaign has shifted its viewpoint from wanting to negotiate access to the Single Market to seeking alternative models in order to keep the focus on immigration, not economics.  Norway and Switzerland are quoted as potential role models - but they are not. Both Norway and Switzerland have accepted the free movement of EU citizens as part of their trade agreements with the EU.

Michael Gove has pointed to the Albania-Ukraine model as the way forward. Putting aside that Albania accounts for 0.1 per cent of European trade and half the population live below the global poverty line of $5 per day, Michael Gove clearly does not understand the Stabilisation and Association Agreements in the Western Balkans. These arrangements were designed as support at the start of a journey towards EU membership and integration for relatively small, troubled economies, rather than a separation settlement for a big, successful one. Olli Rehn, who negotiated such pacts as EU enlargement commissioner, said he was \\\\\\\"surprised\\\\\\\" the Leave side would want an agreement that would put the UK \\\\\\\"permanently on the substitutes bench\\\\\\\".  Boris Johnson has a vision of the UK undertaking trade negotiations with every country and regional organisation in the world from scratch. EU trade agreements apply in the territory of its member states but if we leave the EU, we will no longer benefit from those agreements, including the 22 the EU has made with the UK's Commonwealth partners. We would no longer be covered by the negotiations with the US, Japan and other leaders in world trade now heading towards conclusion. Boris Johnson argues that the UK could quickly negotiate its own set of trade agreements to compensate. I defer to the view of Peter Sutherland, first Director General of the World Trade Organisation: \\\\\\\"This, judging from my long experience of trade negotiations, is highly unlikely. The trends are towards bloc-to-bloc negotiations. The US has confirmed that it would prefer to negotiate with the EU (with the UK in the EU, by the way).  \\\\\\\"The last in this catalogue of claims is that, if all else failed, the UK could rapidly negotiate its own trade agreement with the EU and somehow thereby replicate all the benefits of the single market. This would include \\\\\\\"passporting\\\\\\\" in financial services - the system, crucial to the City of London, by which a company based in one-member state can trade throughout the single market. Never mind that even the recently agreed EU-Canada trade deal, the most comprehensive the union has ever agreed (and seven years in the making), does not give the Canadians passporting rights.

{"instruction": "Extract attitudes between entities and topics from the article in json format and categorize them [Positive, Neutral, Negative] and justify them quoting the article", "input": "searching for a few facts myself.  First, the most startling fact is that the House of Commons has undertaken a significant study on this but failed to (successfully at least) publish it. One has to resort to an independent and comprehensive report from the Centre for European Policy Studies to find the outcome of the House of Commons analysis: 6.8 per cent of primary UK legislation and 13.8 per cent of UK secondary legislation had a role in implementing EU law - 20.6 per cent of legislation in total compared to the 75 per cent that we hear from prominent Leave campaigners.  Turning to the content of these EU driven laws: how do they affect our lives and would we repeal them? Most of the areas where EU laws take precedence set the business norms and standards that all nations must observe in a global economy. Some establish levels of protection for workers; others, environmental controls. In short, most of these laws we should welcome or at least accept are necessary to trade in the Single Market. They will continue to apply if we leave and want to continue to trade with Europe. I was surprised recently when Sir James Dyson and Sir Anthony Bamford - both founders and leaders of extraordinarily successful global businesses - came out in favour of Brexit. Both believe they have axes to grind on EU laws. Dyson has failed in an EU legal challenge to competitor labelling practices; Bamford has lost a six-year battle against a \\\\u20ac39 million fine by the Commission for anti-trust breaches. Whatever the merits or not of their cases, these laws will not go away if we exit and still want to continue to trade with Europe.  On many other policies the UK has opted out - the euro, Schengen (open borders) and some elements of legal and judicial affairs, for example. And on the legislation that really affects our daily lives, for instance taxes, welfare, war and peace, and national security, policy has been set by Westminster politicians. We may agree or disagree with these laws but we cannot claim they are EU driven and that we have surrendered democracy or self-government.  It is also wrong to argue, as Nigel Farage does frequently, that EU laws are imposed by unelected bureaucrats in the European Commission. The commission only proposes draft legislation. It is then adopted by the Council of Ministers, consisting of elected national governments, and the elected European Parliament. The harsh reality - an irony here for the Brexiteers - is that the House of Commons is poor when it comes to overseeing our EU policies. The unelected House of Lords actually does a much better job, as do the national parliaments in Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands for example.  Finally, sovereignty of which nation are we demanding: England and Wales? Let us be absolutely clear - a vote to leave the EU will ultimately mean a vote for Scotland to leave the UK and hence the break-up of the UK as we know it today. Both Yes and No voters in the Scottish referendum favoured EU membership. A Brexit will trigger a new Scottish referendum. Imagine Anglo-Scottish border controls along the 100 miles between Berwick or Gretna. And imagine border controls between Ireland and Northern Ireland along the 500 miles between Lough Foyle and Carlingford Lough. This used to be one of the most politically contentious borders in the world with customs posts turned into military check points. Ireland did not sign up to Schengen, preferring instead to opt for its current passport free status (shared with the Channel Islands and Isle of Man) as part of the Common Travel Area.

You see a globalized world, bursting with opportunities, and you want your state to win a slice of that big pie.  But this week, that expansive worldview is facing a test in the form of a referendum in the United Kingdom - the single largest foreign investor in the U.S. economy. Money from the U.K. makes up about 15 percent of all cumulative foreign direct investment holdings in this country.  In other words, what happens in the U.K. can make a difference here. If British companies - say BP, HSBC Bank, GlaxoSmithKline, Unilever and Prudential - are making lots of money, then they can afford to invest more here.  Sponsor Message  But the U.K.'s economic future may be changing, thanks to a decision coming on Thursday. Voters throughout the United Kingdom, including England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, will decide whether to stay in the European Union, a 28-member collection of countries with deep economic and regulatory ties.  If voters say it's time to leave, then Britain will begin the process of severing many bonds with the European continent. People have been calling that outcome \\\\\\\"Brexit.\\\\\\\"  Enlarge this image toggle caption Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP  Overwhelmingly, U.S. business leaders are pulling for the U.K. to remain. They fear such a big change might derail the U.K. economy and unravel the EU. It's easier to do business with a single, large economic entity, rather than cope with 28 different sets of rules spread over a half-billion Europeans.  Such concerns were floating in the air this week in Washington, D.C., as British investors met with state economic teams attending the two-day SelectUSA Investment Summit, sponsored by the U.S. Commerce Department. The annual event works like a speed-dating party. Each state tries its best to catch the eye of potential foreign suitors strolling the exhibit floor of the Washington Hilton.  Americans working in those booths hand out brochures (and let us be honest: candy) to attract visitors, who represent 70 foreign markets. They have good reason to work hard. Last year, this country saw a record $348 billion in foreign direct investment.  Sponsor Message  So here is a sampling of Brexit thoughts from chats with state economic development officials attending SelectUSA:  California: Brian Peck said his state's business leaders would rather see the U.K. stay in the EU \\\\\\\"for the stability of it.\\\\\\\" If the U.K. votes to leave, \\\\\\\"it could have a domino effect on Europe,\\\\\\\" creating regulatory chaos.  South Carolina: Jeremy Cauthen noted that in recent years, BMW and Volvo - both European manufacturers - have chosen South Carolina as the place to build vehicles. He did not want to take sides on Brexit specifically, but said, \\\\\\\"We do everything we can to attract investments\\\\\\\" - and it helps when European companies are prosperous and looking to expand.  Colorado: Stephanie Dybsky said her state's smaller businesses are not paying much attention to Brexit, but larger companies are. \\\\\\\"A number of big companies have offices in the U.K. because it gives them access to the whole European market,\\\\\\\" she said. If the U.K. were to leave the EU, then those Colorado companies would face tough decisions about moving operations from the U.K. to the continent.

In our mountains, poor forest lands management in our urban forest communities, such as Big Bear, Running Springs and Lake Arrowhead (building foundations within drip lines or right up to the trunks, trees growing through decks, paving over treed areas, etc.), has weakened trees and caused an exacerbation of bark beetle populations even in average rainfall years. The trees' natural means of expelling bark beetles is to pump sap, literally blocking the beetles in their bore holes. With the drought, the trees can not produce enough sap and the bark beetle populations have exploded from the urban forest areas out into the natural forestlands, devastating some areas with high numbers of tree mortalities.

Roy believes that these young people \\\\\\\"find in Islam the best way to express, experience, and to live their rejection of society.\\\\\\\" This theory has proved controversial among other scholars, who tend to stress the opposite: the radicalization of Islam through the spread of Salafist ideas.  I spoke by phone with Roy, who is also the author of Holy Ignorance: When Religion and Culture Part Ways. In our conversation, which has been edited and condensed, we discussed Donald Trump's strange brand of Islamophobia, how Muslims are assimilating in Europe, and what the Orlando shooter tells us about radicalism.  Isaac Chotiner: How does Omar Mateen fit into your thinking about radicalization?  Olivier Roy: The first point is that the guy is second-generation, which is the most common pattern for terrorists. The second point is that, to the extent we know-and every day we learn something new about him-he was not very religious: He was an angry man without a precise cause. One thing that is interesting is that his family was Afghan, and his father has made political statements. But he never mentioned Afghanistan during the killing. He could have said he was attacking the American people in revenge for Mullah Mansour, the Taliban leader killed by an American drone. He could have justified his anti-American stance by referring to events in Afghanistan. He did not.  Advertisement  Advertisement  Advertisement  Advertisement  This is a very common pattern among terrorists. Terrorists almost never refer to their own country or the country of origin of their parents. They usually refer to global jihad, not to concrete situations. You can be angry at the United States government for good reasons, or at least real reasons: drones, the invasion of Iraq, and so on. But these guys always refer to virtual, global jihad.  What does that signify to you?  They are not reacting to a real situation. They are not reacting to a real conflict. They are in a virtual war. The key thing about Daesh is that it has evolved to promote a narrative of global or virtual jihad: Daesh almost never mentions real conflicts. It attracts these types of guys who are what I call de-culturated and who never adjust to any society, whether it is American society or any society. It is not the revenge of the Afghans against the Americans. It is not connected to real struggles. They live in an imaginary world.  Advertisement  It sounds like you think this guy was on a path to some sort of radicalization or violence, whether or not it was through Islam.  I think that these guys do not become radicalized because they become more and more religious. It is not religious radicalization that leads to political radicalization. When they became radical, they are religious. They frame their wrath in a religious narrative. They think they will go to paradise. It is Islamization of radicalization. I think Islam is the framework of the radicalization; it is not the primary cause.

Advertisement  Advertisement  Advertisement  These guys are not Salafi. The idea that this is the Salafization of Islam does not make sense because their approach to salvation is not the Salafi approach. The Salafis do not believe in suicide. They think that suicide is a sin against God, like the Jews and the Christians. If you kill yourself or put yourself in a position where you will necessarily be killed, you preempt the will of God. But in the mind of the suicide bombers, the idea is that you do not need to be a good Muslim, you do not need to pray five times a day, you do not need to go for hajj. If you make a supreme sacrifice, you will go directly to paradise and there is no need to be strict believer.  Advertisement  If what you are saying is true, how do we stop these attacks? We often hear that the solution is to \\\\\\\"moderate\\\\\\\" Islam, but that would not seem to be the solution in the narrative you just laid out.  These guys are attracted by the narrative of Daesh. And Daesh today is the only international anti-society, anti-world order group. There is no more global international extreme left. If you take [left-wing parties] Podemos in Spain or Syriza in Greece, these movements are now anti-globalization. The only global movement now is radical Islam, which explains the number of converts-which is extraordinary. The number of converts who have joined the jihad is between 20 percent and 30 percent.  Advertisement  Advertisement  Advertisement  The issue now is to debunk the narrative of Daesh. We should penalize Daesh by not depicting it as the biggest threat to Western civilization-that condones their propaganda. The second point is that we should not allow radical Islam to have a monopoly on Islam. For that, we should let rise a normal Islam, not a moderate Islam. The concept of moderate Islam is totally misleading: You do not have moderate religion. Calvinism is not moderate. Calvin and Luther were not moderates. They were radicals. But you can have moderate believers who are not necessarily moderately believing. We should let normal Islam emerge as a religion in the public sphere. In the United States, this is easier because religion is accepted. But in Europe it is a problem. The trend in Europe is to consider any religion as a potential problem.  Advertisement  Advertisement  Is this why you think countries like France tend to have a bigger problem with radicalization than the United States?  Yes. Because the answer to radicalism in France is to marginalize religion more and more. It is to expel religion from the public space. And if you expel religion from the public space, then you give religion to the extremes and the radicals.  Advertisement  I am guessing you do not like Donald Trump's approach to Islam.  It is interesting because Trump is not a religious guy. His Islamophobia is linked with some sort of contempt of religion. That's the ambiguity of it. It is not a Christian Islamophobia. Trump does not pay lip service to religion when he attacks Islam. He does not say you can be a nice believer or anything like that. He rejects Islam as a rule and he never speaks about good religion, even Christianity.

We all know what this could mean for the economy, immigration, jobs, fishing and even VISA-free travel, but what does Brexit mean for technology?  Tech is big business for the United Kingdom. The UK's IT industry is worth \\\\u00a358 billion to the economy annually. London-based tech firms alone raised \\\\u00a31.09 billion in venture capital last year. There are 42.4 million smartphone users in the UK, and that's steadily rising. We are the world's fifth biggest economy, and technology and science make up a big part of that.  Leaving the EU will have consequences for every sector, and technology is no exception. No one can say for certain what will happen when (presumably) leave, however Norway - who chose not to enter the EU in 1994 and was often cited as an example by pro-Brexit campaigners - delivered a warning that being alone is not all fun and games.  Of course the politicians can be wrong, the experts can be wrong, and the business leaders can be wrong - this is new territory. They can also be right, and some of the world's most influential technologists have been quite vocal about the EU referendum.  Related: 4 ways Brexit is melting the internet  What are big tech companies saying?  There is no shortage of corporate bigwigs wading in on the EU debate, and that's a good thing. When it comes to Brexit, it's important to get a view of what our country's biggest technology business leaders believe will happen. It's their livelihoods on the line, after all.  It's no surprise that the Remain camp has garnered the lion's share of support from big business. The majority of UK exports to the EU, across both services and manufacturing, can largely (though not exclusively) be sourced to the major corporations.  Some of the key tech players throwing their lot in with Remain include: Bill Gates (Founder of Microsoft), Richard Branson (Founder of Virgin), Stephen Hawking (Award-winning physicist), Stephen Fry (Actor and technology columnist), Dr Ian Robertson (Board member at BMW, Gavin Patterson (CEO of BT), Martha Lane Fox (Founder of Lastminute.com), Dido Harding (CEO of TalkTalk), Ronan Dunne (CEO of Telefonica O2 UK), David Stokes (CEO of IBM), and Tim Berners-Lee (inventor of the World Wide Web).

So we have heard from big business, but there is more to the UK economy that giant corporations. What does the UK's booming tech start-up sector have to say about the prospect of Brexit?  Well, it seems that the vast majority of start-ups are keen to stay in the EU. A recent study by Coadec found that 81% of people in the digital start-up sector are hoping for a Remain vote. The sample size was 175, including 126 start-up founders, 26 start-up employees, 19 investors, and four others.  The study revealed that the key issues for the Remainers were:  Access to a large single market, with harmonised regulations  Free movement of labour, giving access to a talented workforce  Having a 'seat at the table'  Stability and security  The key issues for Leavers, meanwhile, were:  Sovereignty  Over-regulation and red tape  \\\\\\\"These results are not surprising,\\\\\\\" explains Coadec in its survey analysis. \\\\\\\"The UK's start-up community is international in its outlook and in its composition. Founders come to the UK from across Europe (and the world) to launch and grow their businesses. They look to Europe for talented staff to help them grow. And they aim to sell and expand across a trading block of 500 million consumers.\\\\\\\"  The Coadec survey is not alone in its findings, either. A survey from Tech London Advocates found 87% of start-ups wanted to remain, while research by techUK found that 71% wanted to remain in a reformed EU.  In fact, a Brexit vote could be felt very acutely by many of the UK's tech start-ups. That's because of the uncertainty over immigration legislation and the possible loss of free movement of labour.  Robert Newry, who founded technology recruitment service Arctic Shores, believes that the current interest in UK start-ups will \\\\\\\"dry up\\\\\\\" if we leave the EU:  \\\\\\\" We currently have 14 employees, four are European, three of whom are first-generation . We need multi-lingual staff and we can not find all the expertise we need from within the UK. Brexit would cause us not just hiring issues, but contract and revenue ones too.\\\\\\\"  Today, Britain's EU membership guarantees free movement of people. But if we leave, there is a chance that the UK could place new restrictions on who can enter and leave the UK. However, if the UK negotiates access to the single market post-Brexit, it's highly likely we'd have to accept free movement of labour as a caveat anyway.  Alex Hemsley, who co-founded Global M, an international technology recruitment start-up based in London, said that being in the EU makes it much easier to hire people in the tech sector:  \\\\\\\"The great thing about being a member of the EU when it comes to hiring is that the search for talent is not constrained by borders or hindered by red tape and therefore startups are free to concentrate on sourcing the best talent quickly and efficiently to", "output": "{\"topical_attitudes\": [{\"source\": {\"entity\": \"Sir James Dyson\", \"references\": [\"Sir James Dyson\"]}, \"target\": {\"topic\": \"Brexit\", \"references\": [\"Brexit\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"Sir James Dyson said that the UK would \\\"create more wealth and more jobs by being outside the EU than we will within it\\\".\"], \"attitude\": \"Positive\"}, {\"source\": {\"entity\": \"Coadec\", \"references\": [\"Coadec\"]}, \"target\": {\"topic\": \"Brexit\", \"references\": [\"Brexit\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"The key issues for the Remainers were: Access to a large single market, with harmonised regulations, Free movement of labour, giving access to a talented workforce, Having a 'seat at the table', Stability and security\"], \"attitude\": \"Negative\"}, {\"source\": {\"entity\": \"Robert Newry\", \"references\": [\"Robert Newry\"]}, \"target\": {\"topic\": \"Brexit\", \"references\": [\"Brexit\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"Robert Newry... believes that the current interest in UK start-ups will \\\"dry up\\\" if we leave the EU\"], \"attitude\": \"Negative\"}, {\"source\": {\"entity\": \"Alex Hemsley\", \"references\": [\"Alex Hemsley\"]}, \"target\": {\"topic\": \"Brexit\", \"references\": [\"Brexit\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"Alex Hemsley... said that being in the EU makes it much easier to hire people in the tech sector\"], \"attitude\": \"Negative\"}], \"entity_attitudes\": [{\"entity1\": {\"entity\": \"Sir James Dyson\", \"references\": [\"Sir James Dyson\"]}, \"entity2\": {\"entity\": \"EU\", \"references\": [\"EU\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"Sir James Dyson said that the UK would \\\"create more wealth and more jobs by being outside the EU than we will within it\\\".\"], \"attitude\": \"Negative\"}, {\"entity1\": {\"entity\": \"Coadec\", \"references\": [\"Coadec\"]}, \"entity2\": {\"entity\": \"EU\", \"references\": [\"EU\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"The UK's start-up community is international in its outlook and in its composition.

Bolton argues that the only thing worse for fundraising than a declining economy is an uncertain one, and that Brexit is likely to cause both: \\\\\\\"Venture capitalists will look at more certain, stable economies and avoid pouring money into London.\\\\\\\"  Investment in science research    Technology is not just about business, though. The UK is one of the largest recipients of research funding in the EU, which has significant impact on science and tech.  According to the Royal Society, we receive a greater amount of EU research funding than we contribute. Between 2007 and 2013, we received 8.8 billion euros for research, development, and innovation activities. It's estimated that we contributed around 5.4 billion euros to Europe's research coffers in return.  Naturally, scientists welcome this cash, which might explain a Nature poll that revealed 83.46% of researchers oppose Brexit, regardless of whether they intend to vote. A further 4.63% are unsure, and 11.91% want to leave the EU. And even amongst researchers that intend to vote, 80% are against leaving the EU.  Professor Stephen Hawking called the prospect of Brexit a \\\\\\\"disaster for UK science\\\\\\\" in a letter to the Times newspaper, signed by over 150 fellows of the Royal Society. The letter reads:  \\\\\\\" First, increased funding has raised greatly the level of European science as a whole and of the UK in particular because we have a competitive edge. Second, we now recruit many of our best researchers from continental Europe, including younger ones who have obtained EU grants and have chosen to move with them here.\\\\\\\"  However, Professor Angus Dalgleish, of St George's Hospital at the University of London, who is campaigning for Brexit, argues:  \\\\\\\"We are standing up against what is a very large body of people who feel that if we leave the EU it will be a disaster for funding and collaboration - and we completely refute that. The bottom line is that we put far more into Europe than we get out. Any difference we can more than easily make up with the money we would save.\\\\\\\"  However, it's not actually guaranteed that the government would match the EU's research spending if we vote for Brexit on Thursday. There is a real risk that the recouped funds could be used elsewhere, leaving tech research high and dry.  How would Brexit affect technology for the average person?  If you are not spending your days in a Shoreditch caf\\\\u00e9, churning out 'game-changer' apps by the dozen, you have to wonder how the EU's impact on technology affects the average person.  Well, to answer the age-old question of what has the EU ever done for us, here's a quick run-down:  Scrapping EU roaming charges  Last year, the European Union announced plans to lower the price cap on roaming charges as of April 30, 2016. Better still, roaming charges across Europe will be scrapped entirely from 2017. That means you can not be charged extra for using your phone texts, minutes, or data when travelling within the European Union.  That's an impressive feat, and here's why. Unlike the USA, Europe's phone market is hugely complex and fragmented, so getting them to operate on a level playing field is very difficult.

And you care about this, apparently. Research from Broadband Genie recently revealed that 74% of Brits think it's important for the government to negotiate a deal to eliminate European roaming charges in the event of a Brexit.  European Union has scrapped roaming charges across EU (Coming 2017)  Rob Hilborn, Head of Strategy at Broadband Genie, said:  \\\\\\\"Like much of the EU debate, it's hard to cut through the political rhetoric and find hard facts, and that's no different when it comes to roaming. What is clear is that, regardless of the results on June 23, consumers are demanding the abolishment of EU roaming charges.\\\\\\\"  Holding corporations to account  The European Commission, the executive arm of the EU, is also an excellent body for holding corporations to account.  The UK, by comparison, has been less successful. Earlier this year, Chancellor George Osborne came under fire after calling the UK's tax deal with Google a \\\\\\\"major success\\\\\\\", despite backlash against the \\\\u00a3130 million agreements leniency.  But the EU has no qualms about putting pressure on Google. Earlier this year, the Commission formally charged Google with unlawfully \\\\\\\"preventing competition\\\\\\\" in the mobile (read: Android) and search (read: Google) markets. There is still some deliberation to go through, but the result could a fine against Google for 10% of its global turnover. Considering its annual revenue in 2015 was $74.5 billion, that's no small sum.  Without the EU, it would be much harder for countries to organise collective pressure on multi-national monopolies.  Protecting privacy  The EU also acts as a buffer against national governments trying to infringe the rights of their citizens. Richard Patterson, the director of security, privacy and comparison website Comparitech, puts it neatly:  \\\\\\\"While the in-out debates have focused mostly on immigration, spending and so forth, it's also important that the public gives consideration to their right to privacy. The UK's proposed Investigatory Powers bill - or Snooper's Charter - would make it easier for the government to snoop on its citizens, but so far the EU courts have been holding the bill back as it is at odds with European Law. Without this protection, the public's privacy could quite literally be at the stake.\\\\\\\"  Patterson added that we could end up in a situation where British citizens have \\\\\\\"far less protections than their EU counterparts\\\\\\\".  Summary  The UK was split nearly 50/50 on Brexit, but the same certainly is not true of the technology sector. It seems that, on balance, Britain's tech and science industries would have liked us to stay in Europe, and that makes sense. Much of the UK's technology industry is based in London, a city that has benefited massively from the European Union. But in small towns far detached from the hi-tech capital, it's likely that the benefits are less conspicuous.  Nevertheless, almost everyone gains from research in science and technology, and rulings like the abandonment of EU roaming charges are hard to gloss over. Had the referendum only been open to geeks, a Brexit vote just would not have happened. Fact.  It seems that contrary to popular belief, sometimes, computer says yes.

Let us know in a Here & Now poll:  For our non-UK audience: given the #Brexit coverage you have heard, would you vote to #Remain or leave the EU?    - Here & Now (@hereandnow) June 22, 2016  Interview Highlights: Diane Swonk  On why the U.S. Federal Reserve is closely watching the vote  \\\\\\\"They are watching it closely because of what could be the domino effect. It's not only the UK, which is 2.4 percent of the global economy. It's what would happen if the UK opts out, and that then triggers a lot of other European countries to consider opting out. That would obstruct trade, diminish economic flows and hurt the overall global economy along with our own. What we have learned is that there is no Las Vegas in the global economy. Anything that happens abroad can wash up on our own shores, sometimes with a vengeance.\\\\\\\"  On what the US has to lose or gain if the \\\\\\\"Brexit\\\\\\\" vote passes  \\\\\\\"What the US has to lose, is the UK will not be as strong of a trading partner as it once was and it's also played a critical role in diplomatic ties because they do speak English, and we have a lot of similarities. They have been very influential in the rest of Europe with us diplomatically, and then breaking their ties with the rest of Europe would also diminish our ties with the rest of Europe.\\\\\\\"  On the potential diplomatic ramifications of \\\\\\\"Brexit\\\\\\\" for the U.S.  \\\\\\\"That is one of the concerns is that if Britain does not have the same role that it does by severing its ties with the rest of the European Union, what we would do is we would lose some of our strength because it is funneled through Britain.  In the wake of the Great Depression, it was these kinds of policies where everyone was for themselves that led to World War II. What the fear is is that we will leave everyone worse off economically by breaking apart, that we are stronger together, the economies are stronger together, and that that will increase tensions across the globe.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"There is no Las Vegas in the global economy. Anything that happens abroad can wash up on our own shores, sometimes with a vengeance.\\\\\\\" Diane Swonk  On how the EU has kept potential divisions at bay  \\\\\\\"We have seen since Britain has become a part of this, not only has Britain's standing as a major financial center risen. London is a major financial center, which would be challenged dramatically. We do a lot of business with London that would hurt us as well. It'd likely move to Frankfurt and then we'd have to see from there where would it go. Centralizing some of these things makes it easier, more efficient for the global economy.  Of course, there is also been problems with globalization. The backlash we are seeing in the UK today is no different than the backlash we are seeing in the United States from immigration to trade. It's a very hard political sell, even though of all the countries out there, the UK has benefited more from immigration boosting its productivity growth with more educated immigrants. There is a lot of questions for economists if Britain can not stay in and deal with immigration that has actually boosted their growth, then who in Europe can?\\\\\\\"", "output": "{\"topical_attitudes\": [{\"source\": {\"entity\": \"Diane Swonk\", \"references\": [\"Diane Swonk\"]}, \"target\": {\"topic\": \"Brexit\", \"references\": [\"Brexit\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"The backlash we are seeing in the UK today is no different than the backlash we are seeing in the United States from immigration to trade.\"], \"attitude\": \"Neutral\"}, {\"source\": {\"entity\": \"Diane Swonk\", \"references\": [\"Diane Swonk\"]}, \"target\": {\"topic\": \"Brexit impact on global economy\", \"references\": [\"domino effect\", \"trade\", \"economic flows\", \"global economy\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"They are watching it closely because of what could be the domino effect.
