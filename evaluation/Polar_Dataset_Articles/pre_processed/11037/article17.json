"{\"uid\": \"article17\", \"text\": \"This summer, nothing has been bigger than the Paris Olympics. The global games - held across 17 days from late July through last Sunday's Closing Ceremony - set all kinds of records. They drew an average U.S. daily viewership of 30.6 million, an 82% jump from the 2021 Tokyo Games, and created worldwide stars out of some of the top athletes on the planet.  The Paris Games culminated in that star-studded Closing Ceremony, which featured a huge performance headlined by French band Phoenix in the iconic Stade de France, with onstage assists from Air, Vampire Weekend's Ezra Koenig and French producer Kavinsky, among others. The Closing Ceremony drew more than 20 million viewers in the U.S. alone, while its effect led to a giant surge in streams and sales for Phoenix and Kavinsky in particular: Streams for Phoenix's catalog jumped 86% over the prior week following the performance, while Kavinsky's \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Nightcall\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" broke the record for most Shazams in a single day and saw its streams grow 74%.  But it was also a massive showcase for one of the most successful groups of the past few decades and one of the top French groups of all time - and it helps their manager, C3's Matt Sadie, earn the title of Billboard's Executive of the Week. Here, Sadie talks about all the work that went into the performance behind the scenes, the platform of performing in front of an estimated 800 million people worldwide and what this means for the band. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"There have been so many times over the years when we - the management team and Branco, Christian, Thomas and Deck in the band - have all worked very, very closely to bring their special vision to fruition,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Sadie says. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"The Olympics performance felt like a real crowning moment in Phoenix's career, and I am thrilled to have been a part of it.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  Trending on Billboard  This week, Phoenix performed in Paris for the Olympics Closing Ceremony, a huge event for the band and the country. How did that come together, and what key decisions did you make to help make that happen?  As soon as Paris was given the Olympics for 2024 back in 2017, we immediately identified the opportunity internally. It felt very logical that a band of their international stature, from near Paris and largely based there, should have a place in the Olympics. The Opening and Closing Ceremonies were definitely top of the list.  Clearly, the Olympics team were not at the stage of picking acts for the ceremonies in 2017, but around two years ago, alongside my counterpart in France, Laurence Muller, and the band's agent in France, Sofiene Bijaoui from Corida, we identified who the powers that be were and began conversations. There was a lot of perseverance from everyone on the team. In the meantime, last year we planned the band's touring to keep them in Europe over this summer, leaving gaps in the schedule where the Opening and Closing Ceremonies were. This allowed the flexibility needed in case the call came, which it eventually did.  What are the considerations when putting an act onto an event as prestigious as the Closing Ceremony? Was there any hesitation or was it an automatic yes?  How do you say no? Given the scale of the opportunity and the very natural connection in being a French band from the area, it was as close to an automatic yes as one can get. In our conversations with the Olympics team, we were immediately given a lot of independence in putting their set together - there was simply the remit that the performance had to feel like a party for the athletes and that we had 15-17 minutes to play with. Knowing that the band would be playing to a global audience of around 800 million, the priority for us was to put a\"}"
