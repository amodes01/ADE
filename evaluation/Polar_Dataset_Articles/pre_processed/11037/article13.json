His move to offer blue \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"verified\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" checkmarks for sale - and with little actual verification - when the checks were previously used to designate reliable sources in media and government has led to a tsunami of mis- and disinformation about serious issues, like the wars in Gaza and Ukraine.  Musk has cast himself as a free speech warrior - but X under his management has actually agreed to more governmental requests to remove or restrict certain content than Twitter did under previous management, the Washington Post reported last month. Musk's X has also suspended adversarial reporters and algorithmically marginalized its corporate competitors.  And there are some indications he's suspended users for political reasons.  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"He's clearly tipping the scales in this election in favor of Trump,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Mike Nellis, a political consultant and Harris supporter, told HuffPost.  Nellis helped start \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"White Dudes for Harris,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" or @dudes4harris, which was briefly suspended by the X on the same day it hosted a star-studdedZoom call that reportedly raised millions for Harris' presidential campaign.  The stated offense, which cited a \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"user report\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" for \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"violating our rules against evading suspension,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" did not make sense to Nellis, who said he'd never had any accounts suspended from the platform before. He said he wasn't sure if Musk had specifically been involved in suspending his account, but the X owner did snark the White Dudes for Harris fundraising call on the same night, saying of the actor Mark Hamill's remarks during the Zoom event, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"his brain has been marinating in Kool-Aid for a long time.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  Then, just days ago, the independent journalist Ken Klippenstein was suspended from the platform for allegedly \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"violating our rules on posting unredacted private personal information,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" X said, the result of Klippenstein publishing an internal Trump campaign dossier of information about Republican vice presidential candidate Sen. JD Vance (R-Ohio).  Klippenstein argued he never shared any of Vance's private information - he just linked to a leaked dossier that included some of it, including a home address and part of a Social Security number. Klippenstein argued the campaign had pulled the information from publicly available sources. Nonetheless, he changed out the document embedded in the story, replacing it with a version that redacted the supposed personal information. Still, he remained suspended.  Klippenstein's account was restored to X several days later, however - right after The New York Times reported that the Trump campaign had \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"connected with X to prevent the circulation of links to the material on the platform,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" unnamed people with knowledge of the events told the paper. CNN separately reported on \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"a conversation with X officials about the hacked materials before Klippenstein was banned and links to his newsletter were blocked,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" citing a person familiar with the matter.  Even now, with Klippenstein's account restored and the supposed personal information in the dossier redacted, users are unable to publish a link to his dossier story on X. Klippenstein's original post linking to the story appears to still be the only link to it on the whole website.  In fairness, Facebook and other sites have also limited circulation on Klippenstein's story - but none have taken the supposed \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"pro-free speech\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" stance that Musk has claimed as his own. Facebook blocked the link for allegedly containing \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"hacked sources or content leaked as part of a foreign government operation to influence US elections.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (The dossier is believed to have been hacked by an\"}"
