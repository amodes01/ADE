"{\"uid\": \"article5\", \"text\": \"Some 50 hospitals across the country, including in Whitehaven, have been announced as 'hubs' that will administer the vaccine for the first time, starting today.  But nowhere in south Cumbria has been listed among places where the vaccine will be available, with residents facing hours of travelling.  The initial locations for the vaccine hubs for the Lancashire and South Cumbria region would be based at the Blackpool Victoria Hospital and Royal Preston Hospital.  The county's public health director Colin Cox said he expected the vaccine to be available from a south Cumbria hub 'soon'.  The vaccine rollout is being managed nationally by NHS England. Explaining why Barrow had been missed off the places where vaccine hubs have been set up, Mr Cox said: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"What's clear is this is the very start of this process.  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"The situation with this nationally is moving very quickly and I hope it will not be long before there is a hub in south Cumbria.  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I imagine that could be very soon. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"The intention will be to roll out the vaccine as systematically as possible.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  Mr Cox said the start of the vaccine roll out was 'superb news'.  And reassuring anyone who thought the jab had been rushed through appropriate testing and medical checks, the public health chief said: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"The sooner it's more accessible the better.  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I would encourage anyone who is told to take the vaccine to do so.  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I would absolutely want to reassure people that while things happened quickly with the vaccine, all the steps you would normally take have been taken.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  As part of the government's vaccine rollout plan, the jab will be given to high-risk patients at 50 hospitals initially before it is made available at other hubs.  Patients aged 80 and over who are already attending hospital as an outpatient are first in line to receive the vaccine.  South Lakes MP Tim Farron has written to regional NHS bosses to ask for clarity on how the Pfizer vaccine will be administered to health and social care staff in the area.  In his letter to the Chief Officer for Lancashire and South Cumbria Integrated Care System, Dr Amanda Doyle, he said: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"The news of the vaccine's arrival in the UK is massively welcome and I am enormously grateful to everyone working in our NHS locally to administer the rollout of the vaccine so we can protect the most vulnerable and ultimately save lives. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"In our very rural area, accessibility is key.  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"At a time when the work of our health and care workers has never been more crucial, working to ensure they do not have to make long journeys to access the vaccine is really important.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  He went on to ask how if the rollout would be extended to Furness General Hospital and Westmorland General Hospital in Kendal to save long journeys to Preston and Blackpool.\"}"
