Winston credited the success of the segment to the strength of his strike team of producers and collaborators who rise to the challenge of crafting great TV moments. The group included producers Raj Kapoor and Dave Piendak, director Hamish Hamilton, former \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Late Late Show\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" writer-director Glenn Clements and production designer Misty Buckley.  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I got to select, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Avengers\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"-style, the people who are the best of the best at what they do,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Winston said.
