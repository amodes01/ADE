That was my first feeling after the referendum. It was a loud signal that we are not welcome any more.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"It's very hard to say right now how things are going to change,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" adds Jurate Matulioniene's 19-year-old daughter, Egle Matulionyte.  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"There was no post-Brexit plan set up. As an individual you want to know about your future, especially if you have lived here for five years and have paid taxes. But there is no stability and at the moment you do not know what tomorrow will bring.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  At evening mass on Wednesday at St Mary's Roman Catholic Church, John Wakefield, a 60-year-old caretaker, prepares for a service led by Polish priest Stanislaw Kowalski.  One of Boston's few residents who voted to remain in the EU, Wakefield says the Polish community, who helped to revive this once empty church, has been badly affected.  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"We had a mass in Polish on Friday night, the day after the referendum,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" he says. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"They were all very emotional and just bewildered, not because anything legal had changed but they were feeling that England was saying you are not welcome. You could see that was hurting them badly. Some of the women were in tears.  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"To be an immigrant is not an easy situation,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" adds Kowalski, sitting on a church pew as the first of the congregation begins to arrive.  He hopes that the wider Boston community finds \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"peace, cooperation and respecting differences\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", he says before walking towards the altar, kneeling down on both knees and folding his hands in prayer.\"}"
