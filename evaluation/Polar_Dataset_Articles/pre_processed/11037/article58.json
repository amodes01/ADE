Advertisement  Amazon CFO Brian Olsavsky says the volatile news cycle is partly to blame for its lower than expected sales forecast for the quarter.  On Thursday, the e-commerce giant said it was expecting $154 billion to $158.5 billion in revenue for the third quarter of this year, below the average analyst estimate of $158.24 billion. Amazon stock prices fell by more than 7% in after-hours trading.  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"On the revenue side, I'd just say it's going to be a tough quarter to forecast,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Amazon CFO Brian Olsavsky told The Wall Street Journal's Sebastian Herrera during a press briefing on Thursday.  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"There is a lot of events that are occupying people's attention right now from political conventions to the election itself to the Olympics,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" he continued.

In addition to issuing a weak revenue forecast, the company also said it missed sales estimates in the second quarter of 2024.  According to Olsavsky, the dip in sales was driven by a shift in consumer behavior, with people opting to be more frugal with their spending.  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"We are seeing cautious consumers, they are looking for deals, they are trading down to lower ASP (average sales price) options when they can, and that has not changed,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Olsavsky said, adding that the shift resulted in brisk sales for Amazon's lower-priced Everyday Essentials business.
