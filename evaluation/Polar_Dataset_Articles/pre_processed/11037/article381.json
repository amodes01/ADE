"{\"uid\": \"article381\", \"text\": \"The result of the Brexit referendum is nothing less than a body blow to Bretton Woods organisations, International Monetary Fund-North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO)-World Bank, that originated at the end of the Second World War. The possibility of an Asian century becomes more feasible, if India can be nimble enough to make the most of the opportunity which has presented itself in Europe.  On 23rd June 2016, citizens of the United Kingdom (UK) shocked the world especially their European partners by voting to leave -\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Brexit\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" - the European Union (EU). Equally upset was the United States (U.S.), whose president had campaigned against Brexit. The U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry lamented that Brexit constituted the loss of his country's dearest friend in Europe[1]. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"The historic concord between the U.S. and Europe (had) made the West safe and rich. Now it's in danger of collapse,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" added Eurasia foreign policy commentator Ian Bremmer, pithily stating what was at stake[2].  Clearly, while these arrangements \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"made the West safe and rich,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" they were never designed to safeguard or promote the interests of developing countries. That is the core issue. Brexit is nothing less than a body blow to the edifice of the International Monetary Fund-North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO)-World Bank that was born in Bretton Woods at the end of 1945, a powerful system which has successfully staved off most attempts of reform to reflect the changes in the world circumstances for the last 70 years.  Financial markets, like the politicians, pollsters and bookmakers, found themselves on the wrong side of the odds and triggered panic selling. The UK's pound sterling fell by 11 %, the most in 31 years, and riskier assets that include stocks fell across the world. Trading had to be halted in Japan while in India, the Bombay Stock Exchange index nose-dived, taking the rupee with it.  But since the initial bout of panic, calm has slowly returned to the markets as UK and European politicians start to confront the cost and complexities of implementing the divorce. Secretary Kerry's request to EU politicians to not be \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"revengeful\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"[3] while negotiating the terms of UK's exit reveals the tensions. The increasingly loud demands by right-wing parties across other major EU members like France and Netherlands for similar referendums indicate the extent of discontent.  Apart from the dislocation in the EU and global financial market, Brexit is loosening the western-dominated, post-second world war geopolitical and economic arrangements, and allowing emerging powers like China and India to obtain a fair, proportionate representation of their interests which they have, so far, been largely unsuccessful in securing.  Outgoing UK Prime Minister David Cameron was realistic when he said that UK should now seek the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"strongest possible economic links\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"[4] with \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"important partners like India and China.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" This is an argument that those in favour of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"leaving\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" had also made, albeit shaded by colonial nostalgia.  There are several potential opportunities for India in the Brexit turmoil. First London, the global financial centre already hosts substantial Indian private interests. Moreover, Brexit will not immediately alter the status of London as a global financial centre despite the German ambition for Frankfurt to rival and replace it. Indian companies that have been raising money in London will find the continuity comforting. Nearly 800[5] Indian firms already have a presence in UK - like automobile maker Tata Motors (owner of UK luxury brand Jaguar Land\"}"
