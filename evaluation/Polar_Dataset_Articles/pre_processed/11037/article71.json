"{\"uid\": \"article71\", \"text\": \"Paris just put on one of the best Olympic games in history. The 2024 Summer Olympics might have even been the best ever. What the City of Lights accomplished will certainly be a tough act for Los Angeles to follow in four years when it welcomes the world's best athletes to Southern California. Can L.A. live up to its predecessor? It's already off to a good start. During Paris' Closing Ceremony the City of Angels sent Hollywood's biggest star to pick up the Olympic flag. And Tom Cruise did it the only way Tom Cruise could. He repelled in from the massive arena's roof before leaving on a motorcycle.  Not content to only risk his life making Mission: Impossible movies, Tom Cruise climbed to the very top of the Stade de France as Paris bid goodbye to the world. There he took a looooong, solo rope ride down to the ground. After making his way through a throng of very excited athletes, Cruise then climbed on the stage to take the official Olympic flag on behalf of Los Angeles.  For literally anyone else that would be way more than enough. But this is Ethan Hunt we are talking about, so obviously it wasn't. Instead of simply walking out, Cruise got on a motorcycle and zipped out of the arena. Is he-somehow-currently driving that motorcycle across the Atlantic Ocean so he can bring the flag to L.A.? It seems impossible, but with him we are not ruling anything out.  NBC Sports  We also expect/hope/demand he be a part of the 2028 Summer Olympics opening ceremony. We will be massively disappointed if he does not pay off this moment in four years. Los Angeles has the toughest possible act to follow when it hosts the world. But if there is anyone who can deliver on years worth of hype it's Tom Cruise.\"}"
