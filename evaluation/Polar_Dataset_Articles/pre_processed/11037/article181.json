"{\"uid\": \"article181\", \"text\": \"companies are also working on this technology.SpaceX still has more tests ahead. It must demonstrate that the Starship can switch its engines on and off in space, achieve a proper orbit, and then safely return to Earth, eventually landing in the arms of a gantry. However, SpaceX is known for its rapid pace of testing. After completing two test flights in 2023, this was the third in 2024, and the frequency is expected to increase. This success suggests that while there may be setbacks, the company could achieve initial operational capability within a few years.Once operational, Starship will have plenty of missions. NASA 's Artemis programme, which aims for crewed human landings on the Moon, relies heavily on Starship's ability to reach orbit regularly-perhaps as often as once a week. SpaceX's plans to expand its Starlink satellite network, which already has over 6,000 satellites in orbit, also hinge on the Starship's capabilities. Additionally, Elon Musk 's long-term goal of colonising Mars is still in play. He has mentioned plans to send five uncrewed Starships to Mars by 2026, with crewed missions following shortly after.While Musk's broader vision for Mars includes safeguarding civilisation, it also ties into his controversial political views, including his support for the re-election of Donald Trump and his use of the social network X as a platform for spreading misinformation. These aspects have raised concerns, but with the Super Heavy booster safely in its cradle, the prospect of reaching Mars looks more tangible than ever.\"}"
