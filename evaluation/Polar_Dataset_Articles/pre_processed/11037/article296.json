"{\"uid\": \"article296\", \"text\": \"In recent weeks, Tesla CEO Elon Musk and the card game company to people if they refer voters and to those who plan to vote. This is something experts say is not considered vote buying.  Mike Dimino and Alicia Hughes are both law professors and election law experts. They say vote buying is exactly what it sounds like.  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"You have to directly pay someone to go in to vote,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Hughes said, noting that it is illegal.  It's illegal to buy someone's vote and it's illegal to have your vote bought,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Dimino said.  Last week, offered $47 to people who refer registered voters in swing states to sign a petition supporting free speech and gun rights. Dimino said this is not considered vote buying.  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"That's not a payment for someone to vote in a particular way or to vote at all,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" said Dimino.  Shortly after that offer was made, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Cards Against Humanity\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" announced it would pay $100 to people who did not vote in 2020 but make a plan to vote. Something Carla Laroche, a Felder-Fayard Associate Professor of Law at Tulane University says also would not be considered vote buying.  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"They are not paying people to vote. They are requesting that they make a plan to figure out if they are registered to vote, how do they register,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Laroche said.  Comparing the two, Laroche believes the $100 offer does come closer to crossing the line, but it does not go over.  (It's) not a promise to pay somebody to vote,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" said Laroche.  Hughes said if someone is found guilty of vote buying they could face a $1,000 fine and possibly one to two years in prison.\"}"
