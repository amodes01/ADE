"{\"uid\": \"article16\", \"text\": \"The Opening Ceremony at the 2024 Paris Olympic Games featured numerous performances, but there was one in particular that drew mixed reactions, including outrage from conservative leaders.  During the four-hour ceremony on Friday, drag queens and dancers at one point struck poses along a long table as a person painted sparkly blue, singing in French, was resting on a dinner platter in front. Some people quickly took to social media to say that the image resembled Leonardo da Vinci's The Last Supper portrait of Jesus Christ and his 12 apostles before he was crucified.  The table later transformed into a catwalk for models and drag queens to showcase Paris' fashion scene.  House Speaker Mike Johnson wrote on X (formerly Twitter) following the performance, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Last night's mockery of the Last Supper was shocking and insulting to Christian people around the world who watched the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games. The war on our faith and traditional values knows no bounds today. But we know that truth and virtue will always prevail. 'The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.' (John 1:5)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  Donald Trump later told Fox News host Laura Ingraham that he thought the moment \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"was a disgrace.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  French far-right politician, Marion Mar\\\\\\\\u00e9chal, denounced the performance on social media, writing, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"To all the Christians of the world who are watching the Paris 2024 ceremony and felt insulted by this drag queen parody of the Last Supper, know that it is not France that is speaking but a left-wing minority ready for any provocation.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  Full House alum Candace Cameron Bure also expressed her disappointment in an Instagram video, saying, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"To watch such an incredible and wonderful event that's gonna take place over the next two weeks and see the opening ceremonies completely blaspheme and mock the Christian faith with their interpretation of the Last Supper was disgusting. And it made me so sad. And someone said, 'You should not be sad. You should be mad about it.' And I am like, 'Trust me. It makes me mad.' But I am more sad, because I am sad for souls.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  Harrison Butker, the Kansas City Chiefs kicker who faced backlash earlier this year after giving a controversial commencement speech, also quoted the Bible on X after the ceremony: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"'Be not deceived, God is not mocked. For what things a man shall sow, those also shall he reap. For he that soweth in his flesh, of the flesh also shall reap corruption. But he that soweth in the spirit, of the spirit shall reap life everlasting.' Galatians 6:7-8.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  However, the official X account for the Olympic Games shared photos of the performance, noting that it was meant to reference the Greek god Dionysus, not The Last Supper.  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"The interpretation of the Greek God Dionysus makes us aware of the absurdity of violence between human beings,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" the photo's caption read.  Thomas Jolly, the artistic director of the Olympics Opening Ceremony, also defended the performance during a news conference Saturday when asked about the criticism, saying he wanted to display \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"inclusion.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"When we want to include everyone and not exclude anyone, questions are raised,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Jolly said. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Our subject was not to be subversive. We never wanted to be subversive. We wanted to talk about diversity. Diversity means being together. We wanted to include everyone, as simple as that.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  He continued, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"In France, we have freedom of creation, artistic freedom. We are lucky in France to live in a free country. I did not have any specific messages that I wanted to deliver. In France, we are republic, we have the right to love whom we want, we have the right not to\"}"
