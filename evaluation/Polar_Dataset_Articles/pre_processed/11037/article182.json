"{\"uid\": \"article182\", \"text\": \"Structural persecution of faith communities around the world and rising government restrictions on religious expression are real, not internet, outrages that do not consistently receive the public attention and geopolitical pressure they warrant.  Da Vinci has survived Dan Brown; I am confident he will likewise weather this attempt at-what, subversive theater? In a world where Drag Queen Story Hour is already a thing?  The \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"small world after all\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" optimism of the Olympics is a hopeful global vision worth defending, but it is not an accurate depiction of the world we all know. In Pakistan, China, North Korea and scores of other nations, there are plenty of reasons to be outraged when it comes to real, not tongue-in-cheek persecution of Christians. We should attend to those outrages and pass up the offenses that get prioritized on Tik Tok, Instagram and other social media anger-generators.  Let us protect the global strategic outrage reserve for those issues and moments that can lead to actual mitigation of real suffering.\"}"
