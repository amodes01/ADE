The javelin thrower scripted history in France with a throw of 92.97 metres. Not only did he set an Olympic record, but also got Pakistan its first gold medal since the 1984 Los Angeles Games. Days after the triumph, multiple outlets claimed that Pakistani-American businessman Ali Sheikhani would gift the javelin star a 'brand new' car for the historic feat. Pakistani activist Syed Zafar Abbas Jafri had reportedly announced the news in a video.

His father-in-law Muhammad Nawaz has honoured the 27-year-old by gifting him a buffalo after his triumph in France. The unique gift is considered 'honourable' in their culture. Meanwhile, the Chief Minister of the Pakistan state of Punjab Maryam Nawaz, Punjab governor Sardar Saleem Haider Khan, and the Chief Minister of Sindh have rewarded PKR 100 million, 2 million, and 50 million each respectively to Arshad Nadeem.
