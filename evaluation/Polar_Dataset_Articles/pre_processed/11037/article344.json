First arriving to Tuscaloosa in 2020, Blanco was immediately recognized as one of the best in the SEC conference and was named to the SEC's All-Freshman team in 2020.  Throughout her career, Blanco cemented herself as one of the best to ever compete for the Crimson Tide as she won a trio of SEC titles in 2021 (all-around, uneven bars, balance beam and vault) and went on to be named the SEC's Gymnast of the Year that same season.  Blanco capped off her decorated 2021 season as an NCAA champion on the balance beam.  Before graduating last season, Blanco was a three-time All-SEC honoree and a two-time first-team All-American for all-around.\"}"
