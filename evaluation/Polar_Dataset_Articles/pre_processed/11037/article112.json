Elon Musk campaigns for Donald Trump at Ridley High School in Delaware County, Pennsylvania Elon Musk has brought his support for Republican Donald Trump to the Philadelphia suburbs for a town hall.  FOLSOM, Pennsylvania -- Elon Musk held his first solo event in support of Donald Trump for president on Thursday, encouraging voters in the Philadelphia suburbs to register to cast their ballots and vote early, though some attendees shouted back, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Why?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  The America PAC event at Ridley High School's auditorium in Folsom featured the world's richest man speaking onstage in front of a large U.S. flag for roughly 15 minutes before taking questions from the crowd, many of whom wore \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Make America Great Again\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" hats.  The event was billed as a call to action to vote early in the crucial battleground state of Pennsylvania, where Trump and Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris are fiercely contesting the election. Some in the crowd questioned Musk's entreaties to vote early, reflecting the possibility that Republicans are still persuading their supporters to embrace early voting after Trump spent years demonizing the method.  The crowd rose to its feet and took cellphone videos as Musk, the billionaire founder of Tesla and Space X and owner of the social media platform X, walked onstage. They remained standing during his remarks and cheered loudly after he said the U.S. Constitution needs to be upheld.  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"This is literally the fundamental values that made America what it is today. And anyone who is against those things is fundamentally anti-American and to hell with them,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" said Musk, who was born in South Africa. The crowd erupted.  He exhorted the crowd to make sure they and their friends and family were registered to vote and to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"pester\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" those who were not. Toward the end of the question period, which included more than a dozen from those in the audience, he was asked to explain whether people should vote early in Pennsylvania. Musk was momentarily distracted by a fan waving a hat, which he appeared to sign, and then by a child whom he brought onstage for a photo.  Redirected to the question, he said people should vote immediately.  Some in the crowd cupped their hands and shouted, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Why?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" He did not answer. A spokesperson said after the event that he did not have additional comment.  Trump for years has sowed doubt about mail and early voting by claiming it was rife with fraud, though voter fraud is rare in the United States. This year, Republicans are making a renewed push to encourage their supporters to vote early and lock in their ballots, though they acknowledge skepticism from those conditioned by Trump's false claims.  John and Linda Bird, a couple who attended the event, said they had concerns about the integrity of the voting system and worried about voting early.  John Bird said he planned to vote on Election Day. Linda pointed to a sign given out at the event that said Trump called for early voting and worried about the possibility of not getting to the polls on Nov. 5.  Still, she said she'd cast her ballot on\"}"
