"{\"uid\": \"article322\", \"text\": \"New data has revealed exactly how American sprinter Noah Lyles was able to snatch victory by the narrowest of margins after a dramatic photo-finish at the Olympics on Sunday.  The 27-year-old athlete's gold-winning performance in the 100m race was even more remarkable given his poor start, which saw him trailing in last place before he managed to recover and storm ahead at the Stade de France.  But the finish line was so closely contested that the runners faced an agonizing wait as officials scrutinized footage of the final seconds, and Lyles himself told Kishane Thompson, 23, that he believed the Jamaican had won. He was wrong; Lyles had taken gold by just five thousandths of a second.

Noah Lyles celebrates winning the gold medal in the Men's 100m Final on day nine of the Olympic Games at Stade de France in Paris on August 04, 2024. New data has revealed exactly how he was able to snatch victory by the narrowest of margins. More Patrick Smith/Getty Images  Lyles is known for his relatively weak starts, and his gold-winning race was no exception. In fact, the American's start was the joint slowest; he shared a 0.178 reaction time with Botswana's Letsile Tebogo. When told that statistic after the race by a journalist, Lyles said: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Slowest reaction time-that's crazy! I thought I was a little better than that but that goes to prove that reaction time does not win races.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  The slow start looked as if it had destroyed his chances, and he was still trailing in last place some 40 meters in.  But expert analysis of the race reveals how Lyles managed to pick up speed as the finish line approached.  Two-time Olympian Ashton Eaton, a mechanical engineer who won gold twice in the decathlon but now works in research and development at Nike, shared a string of data on the race. Posting on X (formerly Twitter), Eaton revealed how researchers were able to work out the runners' exact speeds using the precise location of cameras filming the race and time-stamped footage.  Here are the graphics we made at Intel. I work at @Nike innovation now so do not work on them anymore so not sure all the details for this version but basically we used cameras and computer vision to track each athlete in each lane. Because the cameras were calibrated to specific... https://t.co/YUWVyV5wqe pic.twitter.com/y2TaLpWYwq - Ashton Eaton (@AshtonJEaton) August 4, 2024  The analysis revealed that Lyles was in third place after 60m, but-crucially-he was now running his fastest at 43.5 km/h (27.02 mph). At that point, Thompson was in first place, but was running at 43.1 km/h (26.7 mph).  Lyles' top speed during the race was higher than any other runner (43.6 km/h or 27.09 mph), which allowed him to reach the front of the pack alongside Thompson, whose own top speed was 43.3 km/h (26.9 mph).  Lyles managed to pick up a top speed of 27.09 mph and maintain his momentum as he approached the finish line.

Lyles told Thompson at one point: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I think you have got the Olympics, big dog.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  However, the images showed that although Thompson's foot had hit the line first, Lyles' torso was marginally ahead-and that's\"}"
