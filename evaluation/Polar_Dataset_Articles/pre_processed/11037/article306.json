"{\"uid\": \"article306\", \"text\": \"One of the most shocking revelations at the 2024 Paris Olympics came right after Team USA track and field superstar Noah Lyles won the bronze medal in the men's 200 meter relay on Thursday.  While Lyles was expected to medal in the race, his winning bronze was made all the more eye-opening once it was revealed he had been diagnosed with COVID-19 on Tuesday.  MORE: Why Noah Lyles was allowed to run the 200 meters at the Paris Olympics with COVID  In a post-COVID world, an athlete competing in a sport while carrying the virus sparks a lot of surprise and concern, particularly for the health of said athlete and those around him for possible COVID transmission. To boot, Lyles suffers from asthma, a chronic respiratory illness.  While speaking with NBC Sports' Lewis Johnson, Lyles explained that he started feeling sick early on Tuesday morning and figured that it wasn't just being sore from running in Monday's 100m relay.  He said a positive COVID diagnosis followed after consulting with the Olympic medical staff.  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"My first thought was not to panic,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Lyles said in the interview. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I was thinking, 'I have been in worse situations. I have run with worse conditions.' \\\\\\\\u2026 We just took it day by day, trying to hydrate as much [as possible], quarantined off, and I'd definitely say that it's taken it's toll, for sure. But I have never been more proud of myself for being able to come out here and getting a bronze medal.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  Noah Lyles provides an update on his condition after the 200m final. #ParisOlympics \\\\\\\\ud83d\\\\\\\\udcfa NBC & Peacock pic.twitter.com/9Qs1vcBycf - NBC Olympics & Paralympics (@NBCOlympics) August 8, 2024  Lyles also told Johnson that he never considered not running in Thursday's 200m and that he's not sure at the moment how his diagnosis will affect his participating in this year's 4x100m relay with Team USA later in the week.  In a separate interview setting, Lyles told reporters that he kept his COVID diagnosis \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"close to the vest\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and did not want his competitors to know he was sick, via ESPN's Coley Harvey.\"}"
