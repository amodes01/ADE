"{\"uid\": \"article337\", \"text\": \"The bishop of Winona-Rochester, Minnesota, who is one of the most Catholic media voices, called out the theatrical opening of the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris for mocking Christianity and the Last Supper, and asked if the Olympic organizers would consider insulting the Muslim faith.

Barron, who is also the founder of the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Word on Fire\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" ministry, in an X-post.  Barron said the enemies of Christianity are putting Christians on notice that the struggle is being fought right now:  Friends, my thoughts on the opening ceremony of the Paris Olympics. #Olimpiadas2024 #OlympicGames pic.twitter.com/xU1ljFMZft - Bishop Robert Barron (@BishopBarron) July 27, 2024  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"We should believe them,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" he said.  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"They are telling us who they are,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" he said. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"We should believe them, but furthermore, we Christians--we Catholics--should not be sheepish. We should resist. We should make our voices heard.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  The opening ceremony for every Olympiad is always an opportunity for the host country to present its culture to a worldwide audience that could be in the billions.  Friday's spectacular marked the first time that the opening ceremony was not contained in the main Olympic stadium. Instead, the organizers also staged performances all over Paris by Beyonce, Celine Dion, and Lady Gaga, complemented by gymnasts on rooftops and a mysterious masked man character in 18th-century costume running through the city with the Olympic torch.  Throughout the city, the French erected statues honoring the 10 golden heroines of French history: Olympe de Gouges, Alice Milliat, Gis\\\\\\\\u00e8le Halimi, Simone de Beauvoir, Paulette Nardal, Jeanne Barret, Louise Michel, Christine de Pizan, Alice Guy and Simone Veil.

There was also a singing and dancing drag queen segment, which seemed connected to the drag staging of Leonardo da Vinci's \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Last Supper\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" painting. This staging culminated in the drag personification of the Greek god of wine, feasting, and frivolity, Dionysus.  The interpretation of the Greek God Dionysus makes us aware of the absurdity of violence between human beings. #Paris2024 #OpeningCeremony pic.twitter.com/FBlQNNUmvV - The Olympic Games (@Olympics) July 26, 2024  One easy interpretation of that juxtaposition is that the organizers were mocking the commemoration of Jesus Christ introducing to the Apostles the transubstantiation of the bread and wine at the table into the body and blood of Christ, which Catholics celebration in the Mass, with a rival deity with an alternative take on wine.  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Would they ever have dreamed of mocking in this gross, public way a scene from the Koran?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" asked the bishop, consecrated in 2015 after Pope Francis named him an auxiliary bishop for the Archdiocese of Los Angeles and the titular bishop of Macriana in Mauretania.  Barron said there was no need to actually pose the question or wait for an answer.  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"We all know the answer to that. I think folks, what's interesting here is this deeply secularist, postmodern society knows who its enemy is,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" he said.
