While the Pfizer vaccine has been given the necessary approvals, regulators conceded that the clinical trial data could not establish the long-term efficacy of the vaccine.  It is not yet known how long the vaccine-induced immunity will last but Health Canada said it will implement a robust \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"risk management plan\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" to monitor immunity and gather data on when it begins to wane. The regulator will also track any \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"adverse events\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" that follow immunization.  Cole Pinnow, the president of Pfizer Canada, said Health Canada's approval means the country can start to return to a sense of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"normalcy,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" with millions of Canadians set to be vaccinated over the coming months.  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"This is historic. We could not be more proud that Pfizer and BioNTech were able to bring to Canada the first COVID-19 vaccine. We think this represents a monumental change in the way that we are fighting the pandemic, and hopefully represents the first big step towards normalcy,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Pinnow said in an interview with CBC Radio's The Current.  With recent polls showing that a sizeable number of Canadians will refuse a vaccine altogether, or will wait some time before lining up for a shot, Pinnow said he wants Canadians to be assured the product is safe.  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I would reassure Canadians that the scientific rigour and regulatory oversight that went into this product is as robust, if not more robust, than any other vaccine that's been brought to market,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" he said.

Duration 2:19 Health Canada chief medical adviser Dr. Supriya Sharma briefed reporters on the vaccine's approval during a briefing on Wednesday.  Dr. Supriya Sharma, the chief medical adviser at Health Canada, also sought to reassure Canadians that her department conducted a \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"rigorous\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" review of all the product's clinical trial and technical information.  She said scientists found \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"strong evidence\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" that the vaccine's potential benefits far outweigh any risks.  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Canadians can have confidence ... the vaccine was authorized only after a thorough assessment of the evidence demonstrated it had met Health Canada's strict standards for efficacy, safety and quality,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" she said.  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"It's an exceptional day for Canada. In a year when we have not had a lot of good news, this is a bit of good news and we should acknowledge that.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  WATCH: Health Canada calls Pfizer approval a 'critical milestone' in fight against COVID-19:  Pfizer Canada addresses concerns over Bell's palsy in U.S. vaccine trials Duration 0:18 Pfizer Canada president Cole Pinnow said the four occurrences of facial paralysis among close to 22,000 subjects in U.S. clinical trials who received the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine represented a frequency not above what is expected in the general population.  British regulators warned Wednesday that people who have a history of serious allergic reactions should not receive the new Pfizer vaccine as they investigate two adverse reactions that occurred on the first day of the country's mass vaccination program.  Asked about those warnings, Sharma said Canada is in constant communication with British authorities.  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"We are always on the lookout for more serious adverse events,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" she said. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"It is still a vaccine and there are potential risks even if they are rare. That's why it's important that we still continue to monitor it.  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Because these vaccines will be used in otherwise healthy people ... our tolerance for safety issues is very, very low.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  WATCH: Health Canada discusses allergic\"}"
