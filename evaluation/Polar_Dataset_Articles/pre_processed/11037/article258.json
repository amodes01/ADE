Another key concern would be that ongoing negotiations of a trade agreement between the EU and the East African Community (EAC) would be delayed as the EU copes with the UK's departure.    On Oil & Gas sector, Oil prices are seeing a nascent recovery as a supply and demand imbalance shows signs of coming to an end. Demand at a global level is predicted to grow while supply weakens, supporting prices after two years of declines. Brexit or none, the combination of healthy demand and declining supply should result in a global market that will be roughly balanced in the second half of 2016. The long awaited re-balancing has been bullish for oil prices and it's expected to continue until next year.    If there is a Brexit, the key takeaway is that the shift from an oversupplied to a balanced market will, in my view, overwhelm the small fundamental impact of slightly weaker demand due to currency effects. The bottom line? \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"The negative impact of a Brexit on oil prices would be driven by risk aversion, not fundamentals, The EAC, or Uganda, will also struggle to attract supporting investors aimed at financing its expansive budget for the newly discovered Oil activities like the proposed refinery;    The other major impact of a 'Brexit' on EAC and Uganda in particular would be further deterioration of the region's already struggling economy, which has been caused by the fall in global oil prices and a steep drop in local crude production due to an insurgency in the region, . A slowing UK economy on the back of a departure from the EU and potential disruption as the UK renegotiates its trade agreements, would be likely to reduce trade flows, foreign direct investment, and Ugandan remittances.    In conclusion; The UK vote to leave the EU was based on a non-binding advisory referendum and does not guarantee the UK's departure from the EU. However, months of political uncertainty throughout Europe will rattle global and African markets and this directly affects EAC in particular Uganda's newly discovered treasure (Oil). However, if the UK does leave the EU, the impact on many African economies will be short-term and relatively insignificant. The UK will have two years to renegotiate trade agreements with African countries. Also, the effective implementation of a new foreign exchange mechanism and liberalisation of the fuel sector will face fresh hurdles as the UK withdraws from the EU.
