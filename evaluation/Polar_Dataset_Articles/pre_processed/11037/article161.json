"{\"uid\": \"article161\", \"text\": \"Although no one knows yet what form the U.K.'s new relationship with the EU will take, likely models incorporate drawbacks for research. If the U.K. remains in the EEA, it will have to pay its share to stay in the common market. This will eliminate cost savings from the withdrawal, predicted Michael Fuchs, a German Parliament member quoted by the BBC. At the same time, the U.K. will lose the influence it currently wields in Brussels to set EU policy. A U.K. Conservative serving in the European Parliament, Vicky Ford, credits U.K. votes with reducing bureaucracy in EU funding and regulations, as reported by the Nature article on Brexit. Thus, ironically, Brexit might saddle the U.K. with a kind of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"taxation without representation\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in the EU.  Some analysts believe the U.K. is more likely to follow the Switzerland model, which would give it greater freedom from EU rules. Here, too, the U.K. would pay to access the EU market and, since the fee is based on gross domestic product and population, might not see savings. Participation in EU programs would remain contingent on allowing free movement across borders. A 2014 Swiss referendum that favored caps on immigration violated EU agreements and resulted in the country being temporarily shut out of Horizon 2020 and other EU funding programs. Switzerland later negotiated for limited access, but this arrangement is up for review this year and may be suspended if the Swiss implement immigration quotas. Meanwhile, the country's limited access has already damaged science there, accounting for the drop in Horizon 2020 grants won. The same scenario could occur in the U.K. if politicians insist on closing borders, Galsworthy warned.  Not a single researcher contacted by Alzforum, nor reputable reports published since the vote, saw clear advantages to research in general, or neurodegenerative research in particular, flowing from the vote to leave. Researchers agree it is now more important than ever to pressure politicians to take science into account when negotiating the U.K.'s future course. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"British scientists must now work hard to urge policymakers to promote continued scientific collaborations and advise on how to move ahead,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Graeme Reid at UCL wrote in a June 27 Science editorial. The stakes are high. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"The science in the U.K. is the best of Europe. It would be a big loss if the U.K. steps away from its responsibility and engagements,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" De Strooper wrote to Alzforum.-Madolyn Bowman Rogers\"}"
