Hong, 20, who trains in Houston, was born in Plano and is a sophomore at Stanford University.  Hong, who earned NCAA team and vault champion honors with Stanford, performed one of the hardest vaults in the world on Monday. Commentators called the vault, which featured two flips and a full twist wrapped in, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"death-defying.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  Asher Hong's stellar vault helped the U.S. men capture a bronze medal in the team event, the first men's gymnastic medal for the U.S. in 16 years.  When Team USA earned the bronze, many on the team broke down. After all, it was the third U.S. men's team medal in the last 20 years.  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I mean, it feels unreal,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Hong told NBC 5's Laura Harris. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Jus the whole journey that I have been through to come to this moment and to finally win an Olympic medal for my country and represent them, it feels amazing.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  It's been 40 years since the U.S. men's gymnastics team last won a gold medal. Team USA won gold in the team all-around in the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles.  WHAT'S NEXT FOR TEAM USA MEN'S GYMNASTICS?  Next is the men's gymnastics all-around final, which will be held on Wednesday, July 31, starting at 10:30 a.m. CT.  The Top 24 individual gymnasts, with a maximum of two gymnasts per country, qualify for the men's all-around final. Richard (10th place) and Juda (13th place) will represent Team USA.  The top eight individual gymnasts on each apparatus qualify for the event finals, with, again, a maximum of two gymnasts per country per event.  Nedoroscik advanced to the pommel horse final. Hong is the first reserve on still rings and vault (if anyone drops out, he will compete), while Richard is the third reserve on horizontal bar.
