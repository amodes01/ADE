"{\"uid\": \"article286\", \"text\": \"Former Penn State four-time NCAA champ Aaron Brooks pushes for the next-best thing after a late loss in his Olympic semifinal, wrestling for bronze in Friday's afternoon session in Paris.  Brooks will take on the winner of an early Repechage match in the 86-kilogram bronze medal match at a tentative start time of 2:05 p.m. ET. The match will stream live on Peacock ($7.99+/mo.) and air on a tape delay on USA Network starting at 4:45 p.m. ET.  USA Network has wrestling on its TV schedule beginning at 8 a.m. ET (Session 1) and 4:45 p.m. ET (Session 2). Brooks' matchup will be featured in the network's coverage in the late window.  2024 Olympics Wrestling  Day 5 - Men's Freestyle, Women's Freestyle  Session 1: Friday, Aug. 9 at 5 a.m. ET (11 a.m. in Paris)  TV coverage (tape delay): USA Network starting at 8 a.m.  Session 2: Friday, Aug. 9 at 12:15 p.m. ET  TV coverage (tape delay): USA Network starting at 4:45 p.m.  Live streams for all matches: Peacock ($7.99+/mo.)

That loss dropped Brooks to one of two bronze medal matches, as he awaits the winner of the Repechage match between Uzbekistan's Javrail Shapiev and Canada's Alex Moore.  Brooks swept 2020 Olympic champ David Taylor in their best-of-3 final at the US Olympic Team Trials in State College. And he looked like a gold medal challenger with a 4-3 win over No. 1 seed Azamat Dauletbekov of Kazakhstan in his opener and an 11-1 tech fall over Japan's Hayato Ishiguro in the quarterfinal round. The 24-year-old has more Olympics in his future either way and can still leave with a medal.
