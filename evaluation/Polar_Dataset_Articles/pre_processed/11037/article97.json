"{\"uid\": \"article97\", \"text\": \"The Paris Olympics opening ceremony - held not in a stadium but along the River Seine in the middle of a summer downpour - was both an audacious, awe-inspiring spectacle and a sloppy, rain-soaked fiasco, full of dazzling highs (Celine Dion on the Eiffel Tower) and avoidable missteps (the out-of-synch Can-Can dancers who barely lifted their legs because they were so afraid of plummeting into the Seine). Whatever one's cultural or political perspective, there was plenty to quibble with in the event - and especially its coverage on NBC - whether it was the decapitated Marie Antoinettes, the book-nerd threesome, the foggy camera lenses, or the glaring lack of context or insight from the network's commentators.  But conservatives in the United States - and elsewhere - are upset over a portion of the ceremony that wasn't even broadcast in its entirety on NBC.

At one point in the sequence, several performers posed at the side of the runway, which doubled as a long dining table, in an artfully composed tableau that reminded some viewers of Leonardo da Vinci's \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"The Last Supper,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" the Renaissance masterpiece depicting Jesus Christ and the apostles. Later, in a portion of the sequence that did not air on NBC but was widely shared on social media, French entertainer Philippe Katerine appeared as Dionysus, the Greek god of wine-making, nearly naked, painted blue, and singing on a giant platter of fruit.  Last night's mockery of the Last Supper was shocking and insulting to Christian people around the world who watched the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games.    The war on our faith and traditional values knows no bounds today. But we know that truth and virtue will always\\\\\\\\u2026 pic.twitter.com/s88c9ymG9j - Speaker Mike Johnson (@SpeakerJohnson) July 27, 2024  The scene sparked outrage from numerous conservative figures in the United States. On X, formerly Twitter, House Speaker Mike Johnson said it was \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"insulting to Christian people around the world. \\\\\\\\u2026 The war on our faith and traditional values knows no bounds today. But we know that truth and virtue will always prevail.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Never one to let a culture war skirmish pass her by, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) also weighed in, denouncing the ceremony as \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"anti-Christian\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"satanic, trans and occult.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Even \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Full House\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" star Candace Cameron Bure gave her two cents - and then some - on Instagram. To \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"see the opening ceremony completely blaspheme and mock the Christian faith with their interpretation of 'The Last Supper' was disgusting,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" she said in a video. Donald Trump Jr. also lamented the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"woke\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Olympics.  A group of Catholic French bishops also joined the chorus of criticism, saying the ceremony \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"included scenes of derision and mockery of Christianity, which we deeply deplore.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  Organizers of the event have apologized for any offense the scene may have caused. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"There was clearly never an intention to show disrespect to any religious group,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" said Paris 2024 spokesperson Anne Descamps at a news conference Sunday. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"On the contrary, I think we tried to celebrate community, tolerance. We believe this ambition was achieved.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" According to a post on X from the official Olympics account, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"The interpretation of the Greek God Dionysus makes us aware of the absurdity of violence\"}"
