"{\"uid\": \"article301\", \"text\": \"Simone Biles did not attempt one of her most breathtaking signature moves, the Biles II, during the team competition on Tuesday, but she will go for it during the vault to start today's all-around final, NBC analyst Laurie Hernandez confirmed during the competition.  Biles chose not to attempt it on Tuesday because Team USA is so strong that even conservative routines were more than enough to take home the team gold. There was no reason to risk a fall or a low score by pushing the envelope.  Today could be different as Biles tries to fend off challengers like Suni Lee and Rebeca Andrade as the favorite to win the all-around gold. The superstar, who has five gymnastics skills named after her, nailed a Biles II during the vault in the qualifying round on Sunday on her way to a 15.8, the highest score on the vault of any gymnast.  The breathtaking maneuver involves a back handspring off the vaulting table into a double pike, which is two rotations of the body in pike position.  She became the first gymnast to ever land that combination in an international competition at the 2023 world championships on her way to winning the all-around title. The skill has a maximum 6.4 difficulty rating.  No other gymnast in the world has ever completed one in international competition. The degree of difficulty is so high that even if Biles has points deducted for hopping back on her landing, it does not dramatically affect her score.  She also has a Biles II on the floor exercise, which involves two flips and three twists and requires immense power to get her high off the floor.  In case you are wondering, the Biles I is a double layout with a half-turn in the floor exercise. There is also a Biles I on the vault, which is a roundoff with a half-twist onto the vaulting table followed by a front double full somersault off the table.  Panama's Hillary Heron, 20, became the only other gymnast to do a Biles I in the floor exercise at the Olympics when she did it during the qualifying round on Sunday.\"}"
