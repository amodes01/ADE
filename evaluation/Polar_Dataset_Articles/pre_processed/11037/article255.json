"{\"uid\": \"article255\", \"text\": \"extreme anti-abortion views in speeches and interviews while Trump himself has attempted to skirt the issue, repeating a line about handing it back to the states.  Musk follows Trump even on matters of science, which you might think would be paramount to the CEO of technology companies. But in an interview this week with the ex-Fox News host Tucker Carlson, Musk flirted with the anti-vaxx movement while pulling away from the cliff: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I am not anti-vaccine in general \\\\\\\\u2026 We should not force people to take vaccines,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" he said, before praising the smallpox and polio vaccines. Trump himself has called the Covid shot \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"one of the greatest achievements of mankind\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". During this campaign, though, he's said he will cut funding to schools with vaccine mandates and appointed Robert F Kennedy Jr, the nation's most notorious anti-vaxxer, to his transition team.  In the same conversation with Carlson, Musk repeated a remark he had earlier backed away from, wondering aloud why no one was attempting to assassinate Harris.  Musk previously called Trump a \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"stone-cold loser\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". Trump once vengefully said he could make the tech mogul \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"bend the knee\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". The odd alliance has affected at least one of Musk's businesses. With his rightward shift and the release of the Hot Wheels-esque Cybertruck, Tesla has changed from being a brand coveted by Hollywood and Silicon Valley types to one beloved by cops. It's a transformation much like Musk's own. The value of the company is down tens of billions of dollars.  We will be following Musk's next steps on the campaign trail closely.

To promote the collaboration, the Korean electronics giant organized a tour of MoMA. We saw Vincent Van Gogh's The Starry Night, Claude Monet's enormous Water Lillies, and surrealist painter Leonora Carrington's And Then We Saw the Daughter of the Minotaur.

Photograph: Noah Kalina/The Guardian  Two weeks before the announcement, the Mauritshuis Museum in the Netherlands published a study measuring the neurological effects of art. Scientists found that original works of art stimulate a response in viewers' brains 10 times stronger than the one elicited by reprints of the same paintings.  The philosopher Walter Benjamin theorized the results of the study nearly 100 years ago. In The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction, published in 1937, he argued that original works possessed an ineffable aura that their replicas could never match. Samsung would seem to agree with him in inviting journalists on a private MoMA tour to see the original works. What, then, is the benefit of a piece of art on a Frame TV?
