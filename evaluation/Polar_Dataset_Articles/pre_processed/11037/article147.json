The Republican presidential nominee had said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"They are taking Black jobs now and it could be 18, it could be 19 and even 20 million people,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" during his June 27 debate against President Joe Biden.  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"They are taking Black jobs, and they are taking Hispanic jobs, and you have not seen it yet, but you are going to see something that's going to be the worst in our history,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Trump said.
