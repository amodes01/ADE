How does scoring work for gymnastics?  Gymnasts are scored by two panels on the content and execution of their routine.  Perfect total scores no longer come to a value of 10, though gymnasts can get a perfect 10 for execution. Scores typically fall in the 14- to 16-point range.  Total scores are based on the total of the difficulty score and execution score combined, minus any deductions. The difficulty panel decides the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"D-score\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" while the execution panel starts at 10.0 and deducts points based on how the routine went. The execution score is the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"e-score.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  So it's the D-score plus the E-score minus Deductions to get the total score.  Deductions or penalties can occur if a gymnast goes out of bounds. Gymnasts can lose anywhere from 0.1 points for something small that happened during the routine to 1.0 point for a fall.  The difficulty score is based on \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"difficulty, connection value and element requirements\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and the execution score, which includes \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"execution, artistry, composition and technique,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" according to our partners at NBC Olympics.  The official rule book is the FIG Code of Points.  When was the United States' last medal in the vault at an Olympics?  MyKayla Skinner won the silver medal in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.
