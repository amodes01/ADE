For that reason, I'd suggest joining War on Want's campaign calling on the Prime Minister to guarantee that MPs will have a vote on CETA. You can sign up here.  Before the Brexit vote, ISDS courts posed a risk to every aspect of life in Britain, but my particular concern was the NHS, which could have been compelled to open up to market forces. The EU has not listened to campaign groups, protestors, and members of the public, who have mobilised against TTIP across the continent, but it seems that with one vote the British people have not only protected themselves from the corporatisation of their democracy, they may have also protected the people of Europe.  Economically, if TTIP does get parked, and the signals already coming from the US translate into action, far from being at the back of the queue, Britain will have moved to the front.  We have a great deal in common with the US and there are many similarities in our economies and legal systems. A US-UK trade deal will be far simpler to conclude than TTIP, and I do not have the same democratic concerns about a bilateral UK-US deal that I had about TTIP. The Leave vote has shown that the people of Britain are prepared to walk away from deals if the terms are not right, and, with an accountable Parliament overseeing all our trade deals, we can ensure that fundamental legal and constitutional principles, and national treasures, such as the NHS, can be properly protected.  Advertisement  As a Leaver, the last few days have not been particular encouraging. I have never been vehemently political about anything, other than Britain's membership of the EU, an institution which I have studied in some depth. About a month ago, my Twitter feed transformed from a gentle stream of musings about the creative arts into a torrent of Leave messages, and I know I have lost followers as a result, for which I can only apologise. Within my peer group, I have been in the minority advocating for Leave, but despite my fondness for Europe and the European people, I could not in good conscience accept something as fundamentally contrary to the principles of democracy as the EU and in particular, TTIP. It looks like Brexit has crippled, if not killed, a trade deal that was a profound threat to all of us.\"}"
