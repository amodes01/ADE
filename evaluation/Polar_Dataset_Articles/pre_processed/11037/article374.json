"{\"uid\": \"article374\", \"text\": \"The federal government has given the green light to the Pfizer-BioNTech's COVID-19 vaccine, a key step toward launching the largest inoculation campaign in Canada's history.  Health Canada announced the approval Wednesday after scientists finished a two-month review of the company's clinical trial data.  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"The data provided supports favourably the efficacy of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine as well as its safety,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" the department said in its report authorizing use of the vaccine in Canada for people over the age of 16.  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"The efficacy of the vaccine was established to be approximately 95 per cent. The vaccine was well tolerated by participants and has no important safety concerns. The benefit-to-risk assessment for Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine is considered favourable.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  Canada is just the third country in the world to authorize the vaccine, after the United Kingdom and Bahrain. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration will hear tomorrow from an advisory panel on whether the vaccine is safe for use in the United States and authorization is expected in \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"a matter of days,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" U.S. Health Secretary Alex Azar said Wednesday.  Dr. Howard Njoo, Canada's deputy chief public health officer, said 249,000 doses of the two-dose Pfizer vaccine will be on hand by year's end - shots primarily earmarked for long-term care home residents and the staff working there.  Maj.-Gen. Dany Fortin, the military commander leading vaccination logistics at the national operations centre, said 30,000 doses out of the initial run will be shipped from a Pfizer plant in Belgium on Friday.  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"We expect vaccines to arrive as early as Monday,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Fortin said, adding it's \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"totally possible\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" some Canadians could get their shots by mid-week.

(Adrian Wyld/Canadian Press)  Njoo said as many as six million doses will arrive in the first three months of 2021. Assuming other promising vaccine candidates from companies like Moderna and AstraZeneca secure regulatory approvals, millions more shots will come online in the months to follow, he said.  The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) said today the country will begin immunizing non-priority populations - people other than the elderly, health care workers and some adults in Indigenous communities - in April 2021. The vaccination campaign is expected to end next December.  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"At last, we have a reason to feel optimistic and excited about returning to the lives we led pre-COVID,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Njoo said. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Things are happening quickly.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  Speaking in question period today, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called the Pfizer-BioNTech approval a \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"big deal\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" because it signals that the end of this destructive pandemic is in sight.  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"It's a good news day for Canadians but we are not through this yet. We have a tough winter to go through,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Trudeau said, urging Canadians to respect public health measures even as shots start to arrive.  Long-term care homes to be among first to get vaccine  The Pfizer trial had more than 43,000 participants - one of the largest such trials ever conducted - and regulators found that the vaccine's efficacy was consistent across age, gender, race and ethnicity demographics.  The vaccine is based on groundbreaking messenger RNA technology, or mRNA, which essentially directs cells in the body to make proteins to prevent or fight disease.  The shot was found to be 94.7 per cent effective among clinical trial subjects who were over the age of 65 and who had no prior COVID-19 infection - a significant finding, given most novel coronavirus-related deaths in Canada have been\"}"
