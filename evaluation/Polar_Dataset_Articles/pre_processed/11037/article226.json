Trade is also a lesser concern.    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"In the area of trade, Serbia and the rest of the region are already highly integrated in the European trading area,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" said Jelica Minic of the European Movement in Serbia, a lobbying group.    Minic and others say disillusionment with Europe after Brexit is helping push Serbia closer to Russia and giving pro-Russian groups an advantage. It is a sense that incentives are running out and concerns about overregulation that are driving opposition.    Analysts say if the polls are right, Serbia could see a swing to the right much like other nations in Europe are experiencing. That is also a prediction of pro-Russian groups in Belgrade who believe Moscow has historically been a better friend to Serbia than the West.  Jugoslav Kiprijanovic, a spokesman for the pro-Russian Dveri movement, said his party - a tiny minority in parliament - is raising its calls for a referendum on EU membership.    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"When Britain could do a referendum, what is the problem in asking Serbian people after 16 years of waiting, of moving toward the European Union and we still do not see when we will get there?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" he asked.\"}"
