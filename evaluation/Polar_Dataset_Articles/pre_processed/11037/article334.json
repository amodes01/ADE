"{\"uid\": \"article334\", \"text\": \"Welcome to Shelf Life, where Olympians are breaking down the beauty routines carrying them through the 2024 Paris Games. Today, beach volleyball player Sara Hughes reveals all the ways she's battling sweat and sand, including her favorite anti-chafe stick, the drugstore hairspray that keeps her ponytail intact, and the facial sunscreen that lasts for entire matches.  You know when you go to the beach and you wind up with sand in all your nooks and crannies that feels like it'll never wash off? For beach volleyball athletes, that's a lifestyle. Players like USA Volleyball's Sara Hughes practically live in two-piece bathing suits-and while that might seem like the result of sexualization to some, Hughes asserts that it's not as uncomfortable-or impractical-as it looks.  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"We get a lot of people mentioning, 'Oh, they are forcing you to be in bathing suits when you play.' Honestly, I love playing in a bathing suit,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" she says. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Having sand stuck in spandex or tight-fitting clothes, it's not fun. A bathing suit is a lot more freeing.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  Of course, all that sand, sweat, and sun exposure requires a very specific beauty routine-one that keeps Hughes's skin protected from sunburns and chafing, washes off the sand and sunscreen effectively, and moisturizes enough to prevent her skin from getting dry or irritated (especially around the bikini line). As she and her doubles partner Kelly Cheng prepared to compete at the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris, Hughes broke down the routine she's bringing to the village.  Hair  I love a high ponytail. I have really long hair, so I have to put three hair ties in to make sure it stays in place. Depending on the day, I will have the ponytail in a braid so there is no hair flying around. But sometimes I just let it free, and I put two tiny braids just for texture and a cute style. If it's really hot, I will just throw it up in a bun. Sometimes I will use the Dae hair gel [to slick my hair back], but I also love hairspray. Tresemm\\\\\\\\u00e9 Extra Hold Hairspray has been my go-to lately because they also have a travel size. So it fits well in my suitcase and it really holds.  Hair care [between games] is so important. Right now, I am using the Nexxus shampoo and conditioner. I am naturally blonde and I do not dye my hair, so I like to keep that color. The John Freida Sheer Blonde shampoo and conditioner, I really like. And then a couple of times [per week] I use the K18 hair mask. Getting out of the shower, I use a Wet Brush because I have really tangly hair. I used to not be as gentle when brushing my hair until I learned how bad that is. I just start from the bottom.  I do not go to bed with my hair wet. I refuse to do that because I know that's not good for it. So I will either make sure I have time to let it air dry before going to bed. Or if I have to, I will blow dry it a little bit. I try not to use a lot of heat on my hair. But when I style it, I have been having fun with the Shark hair dryer that has all the different attachments.  Skin  For me, that pre-match routine is really important. I have definitely been trying to simplify my skin-care routine. In the morning, all I really do is wash my face with warm water, then I use Clean Skin Club towels to dry because I have learned how bad it is to overuse your towels and wipe your face with all the bacteria on your bath towel. I put a really gentle daily lotion on because I have dry skin.\"}"
