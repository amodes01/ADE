"{\"uid\": \"article364\", \"text\": \"the most. Each round will be judged individually and the competitor who wins the most rounds wins gold.  Breakdancing is going mainstream. That's great, right?  Yes and no. Local breakers expressed mixed feelings about the art form's global attention.  John \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Flonetik\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Vinuya, who owns 360 Flow Breaking studio in Kensington, Brooklyn, with his wife B-girl Mantis, acknowledged that the sport's ascendance into mainstream national and international competitions can be great for the upcoming B-boys and B-girl dancers \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"because they have a goal to reach.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  But he expressed concern that the practice might lose a little of its freewheeling creativity.  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"There is always going to be a fight between whether breaking is still culture or if it's a sport, now that you can make money off of it,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Flonetik said. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"But there is still a lot of us out here that think about that cultural aspect of hip-hop, and we are not trying to commercialize it.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  Gabriel \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Kwikstep\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Dionisio is one of the city's original breakers who started in 1981 at age 11. He founded the hip-hop collaborative Full Circle in 1992 with his now wife Ana \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Rokafella\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Garcia.  Kwikstep said it's great to see the athletes bring attention to the sport, but said that as breaking goes mainstream, it loses some of its earlier elements.  He said that mainstream commercial competitions like the Red Bull BC One competition and now, the Olympics, avoid the high stakes rivalries of more traditional breakdancing.  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Those are not battles, they are not cyphers in the way we know them,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Kwikstep said. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"In a real cypher, the person you are battling may be your actual archnemesis, there might be real animosity.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  But Kwikstep expressed dismay that breaking's popularity among Black and Latino youth in New York City was waning, even as it's gained a following in places like Japan, the Netherlands and France.  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Black and brown people, we export our culture around the world, and then wherever it was born, it becomes inaccessible to the people who created it,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" he said.  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"After the interest about breaking from the Olympics is gone, how do we keep our own momentum going?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" he wondered.\"}"
