"{\"uid\": \"article252\", \"text\": \"NANTERRE, France (AP) - Another romp for Canadian teenager Summer McIntosh. A gold medal for American Kate Douglass. And, to cap things off, a record-breaking night for Katie Ledecky.  With a silver in the 4x200-meter freestyle relay Thursday night, Ledecky collected the 13th medal of her stellar career to become the most decorated woman in swimming history.  She would have preferred it to be gold, but that went to an Australian squad led by individual gold medalists Mollie O'Callaghan and Ariarne Titmus.  Still, in her next-to-last event of these games, Ledecky broke the mark she shared with fellow Americans Dara Torres, Natalie Coughlin and Jenny Thompson. The 27-year-old now has eight golds, four silvers and one bronze over four Olympics, with every intention of swimming on to Los Angeles in 2028.  McIntosh cruised to victory in the 200 butterfly, dealing American Regan Smith a familiar silver-medal finish.  But Douglass put the U.S. on the top of the podium in the 200 breaststroke, a race that essentially served as a changing of the guard.  MORE:  Longtime American star Lilly King, competing in her final Olympics, finished last in the final. She made her way over several lane ropes to give a hug to Douglass, one of the world's most versatile swimmers and now a gold medalist.  It was the fourth swimming gold for the world's most dominant swimming nation, to go along with 11 silver medals and six bronzes.  Douglass, who won a bronze in the 200 individual medley at Tokyo, now has a complete collection.  She started the Paris Games by helping the Americans win silver in 4x100 freestyle relay. She grabbed the best color of all Thursday.  Douglass claimed the lead on the second of four laps and held off South Africa's Tatjana Smith to win in 2:19.24.  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"For a while, I wasn't sure if Olympic champion was going to be possible for me to say,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" the 22-year-old Douglass said. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Now it's just really exciting to see it happen.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  Smith, who took gold in the 100 breaststroke, settled for a silver this time in 2:19.60. The bronze went to Tes Schouten (2:21.05) of the Netherlands.  King, the winner of five medals including two golds at the last two Olympics, failed to claim an individual prize in her Olympic farewell. She tied for fourth in the 100 breaststroke and finished more than 6 1/2 seconds behind Douglass in the 200.  Douglass has a chance to pick up another medal in the 200 IM.\"}"
