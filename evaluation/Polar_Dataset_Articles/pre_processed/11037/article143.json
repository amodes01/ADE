"{\"uid\": \"article143\", \"text\": \"In Elon Musk's vision of human history, Donald Trump is the singularity. If Musk can propel Trump back to the White House, it will mark the moment that his own superintelligence merges with the most powerful apparatus on the planet, the American government-not to mention the business opportunity of the century.  Many other titans of Silicon Valley have tethered themselves to Trump. But Musk is the one poised to live out the ultimate techno-authoritarian fantasy. With his influence, he stands to capture the state, not just to enrich himself. His entanglement with Trump will be an Ayn Rand novel sprung to life, because Trump has explicitly invited Musk into the government to play the role of the master engineer, who redesigns the American state-and therefore American life-in his own image.  Musk's pursuit of this dream clearly transcends billionaire hobbyism. Consider the personal attention and financial resources that he is pouring into the former president's campaign. According to The New York Times, Musk has relocated to Pennsylvania to oversee Trump's ground game there. That is, he's running the infrastructure that will bring voters to the polls. In service of this cause, he's imported top talent from his companies, and he reportedly plans on spending $500 million on it. That does not begin to account for the value of Musk's celebrity shilling, and the way he has turned X into an informal organ of the campaign.  Musk began as a Trump skeptic-a supporter of Ron DeSantis, in fact. Only gradually did he become an avowed, rhapsodic MAGA believer. His attitude toward Trump seems to parallel his view of artificial intelligence. On the one hand, AI might culminate in the destruction of humanity. On the other hand, it's inevitable, and if harnessed by a brilliant engineer, it has glorious, maybe even salvific potential.  Musk's public affection for Trump begins, almost certainly, with his savvy understanding of economic interests-namely, his own. Like so many other billionaire exponents of libertarianism, he has turned the government into a spectacular profit center. His company SpaceX relies on contracts with three-letter agencies and the Pentagon. It has subsumed some of NASA's core functions. Tesla thrives on government tax credits for electric vehicles and subsidies for its network of charging stations. By Politico's tabulation, both companies have won $15 billion in federal contracts. But that's just his business plan in beta form. According to The Wall Street Journal, SpaceX is designing a slew of new products with \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"national security customers in mind.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  Musk has only begun to tap the pecuniary potential of the government, and Trump is the dream. He rewards loyalists, whether they are foreign leaders who genuflect before him or supplicants who host events at his resorts. Where other presidents might be restrained by norms, Trump shrugs. During his first term, he discovered that his party was never going to punish him for his transgressions.  Read: Elon Musk has the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"off\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" switch  In the evolving topography of Trumpland, none of his supporters or cronies will have chits to compare with Musk's. If Trump wins, it will likely be by a narrow margin that can be attributed to turnout. Musk can tout himself as the single variable of success.  It's not hard to imagine how the mogul will exploit this alliance. Trump has already announced that he will place him in charge of a government-efficiency commission. Or, in the Trumpian vernacular, Musk will be the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"secretary of cost-cutting.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" SpaceX is the implied template: Musk will advocate for privatizing the government, outsourcing the affairs of state to nimble\"}"
