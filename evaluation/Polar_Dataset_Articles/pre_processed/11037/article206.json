"{\"uid\": \"article206\", \"text\": \"Election Day, too.  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Anything can happen, you know, you wake up that morning, some catastrophe happens or whatever,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" she said. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"But, you know, we are planning on voting on Nov. 5.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  One of the questioners asked about fraud in elections - something Trump has falsely insisted cost him the 2020 race. An Associated Press review of every potential case of voter fraud in the six battleground states disputed by Trump found fewer than 475, a number that would have made no difference in the outcome.  Musk said sarcastically that it must be a coincidence that Dominion voting machines, which had been at the center of conspiracy theories in the 2020 election, were used in Philadelphia and Maricopa County, Arizona, located in two battleground states won by Democrat Joe Biden. In 2023, Fox News agreed to pay Dominion Voting Systems $787 million to avoid a trial in a defamation lawsuit the voting machine company brought against the network for lies told about their company switching ballots.  In an emailed statement Thursday, Dominion said its machines are not used in Philadelphia, as Musk said. The statement also said its systems are based on \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"verified paper ballots.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"These are not matters of opinion. They are verifiable facts.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Dominion said.  Musk has become a major booster of Trump this campaign season. On Thursday evening, he cast the election in dire terms.  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I have not been politically active before. I am politically active now because I think the future of America and the future of civilization is at stake,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" he said.  People were lined up to attend before 3 p.m. as school was letting out. A few people began to leave early when it became clear that not everyone who had lined up to ask a question would have a chance to ask one.  The event was livestreamed on X, formerly Twitter, and was at times glitchy and difficult to follow, even as it drew hundreds of thousands of viewers.  Musk is undertaking much of the get-out-the-vote effort for Trump through his America PAC, a super PAC that can raise and spend unlimited sums of money. He has committed more than $70 million to the super PAC to help Trump and other Republicans win in November.  Trump and the Republican National Committee he controls opted for an unorthodox strategy of sharing canvassing duties in key regions with groups like Musk's. They have also focused their efforts not on independent or moderate voters, but on those who already support Trump but usually do not vote.  Republican activists in swing states said in September that they had seen little activity from the PAC's get-out-the-vote efforts.\"}"
