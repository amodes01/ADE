WJ Dog Treats is a small, family-run company of Orlando City fans who are committed to producing healthy, high-quality dog treats with just five ingredients, including their own home-made peanut butter. Give them a try. If you use the code TML at checkout, you will get a dollar off a bag of treats for your pooch!]  Orlando City got its 2024 Leagues Cup campaign off to a smoking hot start, with a 4-1 win Friday against CF Montreal. Four different Lions scored, with Ramiro Enrique and Facundo Torres assisting on each other's goals and Martin Ojeda stretching his streak of games with a goal contribution to seven. It was a far cry from the two draws the Lions had against Montreal in the regular season. Orlando now sits in a good spot to advance to the knockouts with a match against Liga MX side San Luis looming on Sunday.  We break down Orlando City's lopsided home win over Montreal, check on our score predictions, and make our selections for Man of the Match.  This episode's mailbagbox, presented by WJ Dog Treats, asks who would medal if Orlando City players participated in a decathlon. Remember, if there is anything - and we do mean anything - you want us to address on the show, just ask us by tweeting it to us at @TheManeLand with the hashtag #AskTMLPC, or hitting us up on Bluesky Social with that same hashtag.  After the mailbagbox, we discussed OCB's road loss at Chattanooga FC. It wasn't a good performance despite a strong side that included the likes of Jack Lynn and Luca Petrasso. After discussing OCB, we looked at the U.S. victory over New Zealand in the Olympics and discussed how Duncan McGuire is not getting the ball in scoring positions. Hopefully that will change against Guinea today.  Finally, we completely blanked on the fact that we have got another show to record on Thursday and provided our key matchups and score predictions for Sunday's match against San Luis. That's OK, we will discuss it in more depth in our second show this week after we have a chance to see the Liga MX side in action against CF Montreal tonight.  Be sure to rate and review our show wherever you get your podcasts. Remember, we will read any five-star reviews we get on Apple Podcasts on the next show.  Here's how No. 436 went down:  0:15 - Orlando City is back to scoring goals with a Leagues Cup drubbing of Montreal that included a Pedro Gallese save on Josef Martinez penalty kick.  19:07 - The mailbagbox is topical, referencing the Olympics.  31:48 - OCB still can not win, the U.S. is in a decent spot in the Olympics after clobbering New Zealand, and our inexplicable dive into Sunday's upcoming match.\"}"
