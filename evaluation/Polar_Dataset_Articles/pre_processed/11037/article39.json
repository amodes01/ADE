"{\"uid\": \"article39\", \"text\": \"National Movement, TNM, is calling for a Texit secession through a referendum, just like the British have done in the UK. A petition drive last year asking for a non-binding vote on the secession failed to gather enough signatures, but the issue was brought up at the Texas Republican Convention.  The Texit idea never made it to the floor for a vote, but just the fact that it was brought up means the idea is becoming more mainstream.  Should Texans be allowed a Texit vote to decide whether to stay in the union?  [Photo by Brian Bahr/Getty Images]\"}"
