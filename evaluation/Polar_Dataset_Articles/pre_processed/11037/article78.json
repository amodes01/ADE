"{\"uid\": \"article78\", \"text\": \"United States track star Noah Lyles has confirmed that he tested positive for COVID-19 prior to competing in the 200-meter final at the Paris Olympics on Thursday.  Lyles, who earned a bronze medal for placing third in the event, told reporters that he tested positive on the morning of Tuesday, Aug. 6, according to ESPN. But even after receiving his diagnosis, Lyles says he never considered dropping out of the race.  Immediately following his third-place finish on Thursday, Lyles was seen laying down on the track on his back. He was reportedly given a mask and helped onto a chair for further treatment.  Letsile Tebogo of Botswana won the gold medal with a 19.46-second finish, followed by Kenny Bednarek of the United States at 19.62 seconds.  As you can see in the photo above, Lyles was feeling much better on Sunday, Aug. 4 when he earned the gold medal in the 100-meter final with a time of 9.79 seconds. Lyles previously took home a bronze medal at the 2021 Tokyo Olympics.  Lyles told reporters that he does not yet know whether he will be well enough to compete in the 4\\\\\\\\u00d7100-meter relay, though he's confident in Team USA's chances with or without him.\"}"
