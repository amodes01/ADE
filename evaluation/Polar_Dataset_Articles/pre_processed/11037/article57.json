"{\"uid\": \"article57\", \"text\": \"Elon Musk has given nearly $75 million to America PAC, the super PAC he created to support former President Donald Trump, according to a campaign finance filing from the group late Tuesday.  The filing with the Federal Election Commission was the first public look at Musk's political giving this year after months of speculation about how much money he would contribute to pro-Trump efforts. It shows that he has vaulted into the top ranks of Republican donors.  Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, is the world's wealthiest person, with a net worth of $241 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.  He established America PAC in May to support Trump's campaign to return to the White House. The super PAC is focused on voter turnout efforts in potential swing states such as Pennsylvania, where Musk recently appeared onstage with Trump.  Musk gave $14.95 million to the super PAC in July, $30 million in August and $30 million in September, according to the filing. The filing says he was the super PAC's only donor during that period, although in June the super PAC disclosed several donations from associates of Musk, including five donations for $1 million apiece.  A spokesperson for America PAC declined to comment on the filing.  The filing covers donations through Sept. 30. Other filings before the Nov. 5 election may show additional donations from Musk or others.  The super PAC had just under $4 million in cash on hand as of Sept. 30, according to the filing, after having spent heavily in the third quarter.  The extent of Musk's contributions to pro-Trump efforts has been the subject of intense speculation. In July, Trump said at a rally in Michigan that Musk \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"gives me $45 million a month\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" - a figure that Musk disputed a couple of days later in an interview with podcaster Jordan Peterson. Later in July, Musk elaborated in a post on X, saying he was supporting Trump \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"but at a much lower level.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  Musk has given smaller amounts this year to other Republican committees, including to the California Republican Party and the National Republican Congressional Committee.  Few people have given more money than Musk has this year to Republican or pro-Trump efforts. Republican megadonor Miriam Adelson gave $95 million in the third quarter to the super PAC she is using to back Trump.\"}"
