He is there because he is the God of celebration connected to the gods of Olympus. The idea was to have a pagan celebration connected to the gods of Olympus.

On the contrary, I think [with] Thomas Jolly, we really did try to celebrate community tolerance. Looking at the result of the polls that we shared, we believe that this ambition was achieved. If people have taken any offense, we are, of course, really, really sorry,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" she stated per the news outlet.  The 2024 Paris Olympics is set to last for 19 days of competition through August 11.\"}"
