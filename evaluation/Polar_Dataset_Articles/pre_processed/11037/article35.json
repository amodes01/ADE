Another signatory on the letter was Rep. Michelle Steel (R-Seal Beach), who is in a competitive race for reelection in Orange County.

Paul Iskajyan, a Tran campaign spokesman, said Steel \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"can not stand on her own record, so she's being propped up by a billionaire weirdo.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" A Steel campaign spokesman declined to comment.  The PAC has also spent more than $700,000 to support Republican Rep. David Valadao (R-Hanford) in the Central Valley, who also signed the SpaceX letter. Valadao is running against Democrat Rudy Salas, who in 2022 lost to Valadao by about 3,100 votes.  Advertisement  Musk's political metamorphosis goes beyond money. The billionaire now bashes the left's \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"woke mind virus\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and trumpets debunked theories from the right - including that Democrats encourage illegal immigration to shift America's voting base in their favor and that the Biden-Harris administration has shortchanged American hurricane victims while heaping money on immigrants in the U.S. without legal authorization.  Musk did not respond to an interview request sent to SpaceX. But he has previously contended that the Democratic Party had shifted \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"far to the left,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" forcing his jump to the GOP.  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"The Democrats have become the party of the rich and entitled (just look at their donor list) and the Republicans have become the party of the people,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Musk, who is worth well over $200 billion, said on X this month.  The 53-year-old businessman has made clear that he felt mistreated when Democrats, including Biden, criticized him or failed to acknowledge his achievements.  In 2021, the Biden administration did not invite Musk and Tesla to a White House summit for electric car makers, a slight linked to the company's refusal to embrace unionization. The tech journalist Kara Swisher said she spoke to Musk, who was \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"very angry,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" a message she passed on to the White House.  Rep. Ro Khanna, who represents part of Silicon Valley, recently told CNN he thought the reason Democrats \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"started to lose Elon was actually personal.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  Advertisement  Khanna said the party's leaders should have praised Musk's groundbreaking achievements in space and his leadership on electric cars, despite his nonunion stance. In 2022, Musk said on X that the Biden administration had done \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"everything it can to sideline & ignore Tesla.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"We did not celebrate it and he felt offended,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Khanna said.  The billionaire said in May 2022 that Democrats, once the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"kindness party,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" had \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"become the party of division & hate, so I can no longer support them and will vote Republican.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" But, he said in July of that year that Trump should still \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"hang up his hat & sail into the sunset.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  By this year, though, Musk's disgust with Democrats had become more pronounced. He excoriated Gov. Gavin Newsom for signing a bill that will prohibit school districts from requiring teachers to notify families about their children's gender identity changes.  This followed Musk's own public falling out with his daughter, who had undergone a gender transition. Calling the gender law \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"the final straw,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Musk said this summer he would protest California's \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"woke\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" agenda by moving the headquarters for both X and SpaceX from California to Texas.
