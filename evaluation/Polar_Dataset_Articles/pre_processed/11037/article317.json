With the BoE reversing the 0.5% increase in the CCyB, UK banks now have an additional \\\\\\\\u00a3150 billion to lend out. The report also stated;  'The Financial Policy Committee stands ready to take actions that will ensure that capital and liquidity buffers can be drawn on as needed, to support the supply of credit and in support of market functioning.'

US Dollar Pound Exchange Rate Bullish as Markets Demand Safe-Havens ahead of BoE Report  The US Dollar began the day on a bullish rise, as anticipation of the BoE report and subsequent speech by Mark Carney drove safe-haven demand. Before the release, the 'Greenback' had made gains of 1.1% against the Pound and the South African Rand (ZAR), as well as advancing 0.4% verses the Indian Rupee (INR) and the Norwegian Krone (NOK).  USD strength was demonstrative of the global demand for safe-haven assets. The risky Australian Dollar (AUD), New Zealand Dollar (NZD) and Canadian Dollar (CAD) were largely on the decline, while the Bloomberg and Rogers International commodity indices were down -0.9%. Bond yields also plummeted, with the US 10-year Treasury - considered a global benchmark - dropping to an historical low, while the Swiss 50-year bond entered negative territory.  Speaking on the path of the US Treasury yield curve, Westpac's Head of Fixed-Income Research Damien McColough commented;  'This is the most obvious manifestation of the global search for yield forcing investors further out the curve. The size of the drop in the 30-year yield reflects a bit of a capitulation trade, but I am not particularly surprised. The market is now trying to work out what the new range will be.'

GBP USD recovery could continue throughout the day, with 'Cable' potentially closing the session back in positive territory.
