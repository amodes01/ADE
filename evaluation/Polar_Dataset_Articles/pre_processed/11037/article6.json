"{\"uid\": \"article6\", \"text\": \"Over the next four years, Autodesk's software will support LA28's \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"no-new-permanent-venues\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" plan, which will adapt existing infrastructure and build temporary facilities throughout Los Angeles.  Autodesk, a leading software provider for architecture, engineering, design and construction, has been appointed the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Official Design and Make Platform\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" for the Los Angeles 2028 Olympic and Paralympic Games (LA28).  This partnership will support LA28's ambitious \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"no-new-permanent-venues\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" plan, which will retrofit existing structures and create temporary venues. The endeavor, which will cost over $1bn, will transform more than 40 venues across the Los Angeles Metropolitan Area using Autodesk's software tools.  Autodesk's technology, including Autodesk Construction Cloud and Building Information Modeling (BIM) tools, will play a crucial role in optimizing the venue development process. These tools are expected to streamline project timelines, reduce costs and lower carbon emissions by minimizing the need for new construction materials and energy.  Modifying existing buildings aligns with LA28's commitment to sustainability, as built environments account for 42% of global carbon emissions, according to non-profit research organization Architecture 2030.  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Autodesk's software is a part of our LA28 story: the behind-the-scenes technology that brings our vision of the LA28 Games to life,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" LA28 chairperson Casey Wasserman said. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Together, we will develop the right plan to support 12-15 million ticketed fans over such a short period of time. We are honored to have Autodesk on board for the next four years as we embark on our shared commitment in innovative design that can serve as a precedent for many Games to come.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  The partnership will also aid in designing essential transportation and traffic control elements, which further enhances LA28's resolve for sustainable, effective event planning.  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Autodesk's technology is used every day to design and make a better world, which is why we are thrilled to be LA28's official Design and Make Platform,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" added Andrew Anagnost, Autodesk president and CEO. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Our partnership will enable Autodesk software to do more than ever before. Together with LA28, we will help prepare Los Angeles for not only a 29-day celebration but also strengthen the greater Los Angeles community by embarking on our shared vision of a more sustainable Games.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  Autodesk has a growing track record of assisting in globally significant projects, including the restoration of Notre-Dame de Paris. Following the cathedral's devastating fire in April 2019, Autodesk's BIM software created a detailed 3D model of the historic structure during its reconstruction.
