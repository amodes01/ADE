That is how I think of our first meeting.

It is a task I have approached all my life.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"It is a responsibility I take on with respect, pride and great joy. It is a deed I will make an effort to carry through the trust I encounter,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Frederik added. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I need all the support I can get. From my beloved wife, from my family, from you and from that which is greater than us. I face the future with the certainty that I am not alone.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\"}"
