It was Dion's first public performance since she revealed in December 2022 that she has stiff person syndrome.  Earlier in the day, the opening ceremony kicked off with Lady Gaga giving her own twist on a French song made popular in the 1960s, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Mon Truc En Plume,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"My Thing Made of Feathers.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\"}"
