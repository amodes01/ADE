"{\"uid\": \"article87\", \"text\": \"Why is American rapper Flavor Flav at the Paris Olympics and spending time with the USA Water Polo team? Let us explain.  Featured Video  When it comes to things that make you go \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"whaa?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", the Olympics are a harvest season of true abundance, a point that's even more driven home by this year's featuring stuff that's extremely, what's the word, French. From headless Marie Antoinette metal performances to Stranger Things-meets-Phantom of the Opera opening ceremonies, there is no shortage of curios so far at this year's Paris Olympiad.  Flavor Flav is at the Paris Olympics  However, if you have been watching any of the water polo events so far, you may have noticed a recognizable figure who seems lost and, knowing him, very well might have been.

You have undoubtedly caught a glimpse during the broadcast so far and thought, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"wait, should not he be wearing comically large clock necklaces somewhere?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  However, Flav's presence is of a more official manner than you might imagine. And it's fantastic.  How Flavor Flav got involved with Olympic Water Polo  On May 4th, water polo Olympian Maggie Steffens posted on Instagram that revealed how many Olympic athletes hold second and third jobs to help achieve their medal dreams.

That's a FLAVOR FLAV promise.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  How good is a Flavor Flav promise, you ask? As good as its weight in gold clock necklaces, because on July 1st, Flavor Flav officially signed a five-year sponsorship deal with USA Water Polo to cover the men's and women's water polo teams.

Flav's also not content to just cheer from the sidelines. The man wants in on the action too:  Advertisement  Social media weighs in  Either way, Flav has garnered a whole lot of goodwill from the gesture.
