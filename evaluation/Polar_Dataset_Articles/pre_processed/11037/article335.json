"{\"uid\": \"article335\", \"text\": \"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"We require an ID for flying, so you may say you need to show your vaccine document,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Reiss said. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"But paper is not very durable. So maybe everybody has to have a [mobile] application or a paper, and that raises questions about privacy.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  Any mandate is likely to come with a medical exemption, which Reiss said raises the question of whether any doctor should be able to sign off on the exemption. Another exemption legislators would have to consider is a religious one. That exemption may be even harder to enforce because it's difficult to prove.  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"You can not say give me a letter from your priest, because that discriminates against people without organized religion,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Reiss said. She noted that one option would be for legislators to assume people are telling the truth and accept all claims.  If a vaccine mandate is put in place, Tribe said in May, it's \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"almost certain\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" the federal government would have a statute or regulation to back up the requirement. However, it's also likely a vaccine travel mandate would face legal challenges.  Reiss \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"probably would not\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" challenge the mandate, she said. But if she were to, the first point she would challenge is that it goes beyond Congress' power under the Constitution's Commerce Clause and that it infringes on the right to travel.  A lawsuit challenging the mandate would also likely point to an infringement on personal liberty, but Reiss noted the argument would run into the issue in the Supreme Court's Jacobson v. Massachusetts decision. The court's ruling in that case set a 115-year precedent that says individual liberty in the case of a vaccine does not trump the need to protect the public.  Both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccine candidates are at least 90 percent effective, and government and public health officials consider a vaccine to be one of America's best paths toward normalcy. While it could be key to keeping businesses and restaurants open and resuming large gatherings, people remain skeptical about vaccination.  About one-third of respondents were not confident an approved vaccine will have been properly tested for safety and effectiveness, an Associated Press-NORC Poll released on Wednesday found. A similar percentage, about 27 percent, of the 1,17 adults surveyed said they do not plan on being vaccinated.  With herd immunity being key to curbing the spread of infectious diseases, Robertson and Rogers argued in their paper that a traveling mandate could motivate a \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"substantial\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" number of people to get vaccinated because \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"the benefits of airline travel are so great.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\"}"
