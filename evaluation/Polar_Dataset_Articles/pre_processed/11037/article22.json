"{\"uid\": \"article22\", \"text\": \"along with health care organizations across the state, have agreed to follow federal and state guidance when prioritizing vaccinations.  Billings Clinic's ultra-cold freezer can hold 5,000-10,000 doses at any given time, Benoit said.  Also in Billings, St. Vincent said their focus for the first doses of vaccine will be for frontline staff.  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"This will ensure that our healthcare providers can continue to serve and provide care to our patients when they are in need of care,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" said hospital communications manager Angela Douglas.  St. Vincent has approximately 2,500 associates and providers.  Dr. Jennifer Davenport, chief medical officer at St. James Healthcare in Butte, said the goal will be to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"vaccinate as many of our nurses, doctors, staff and patients as possible, but because we anticipate our initial quantities of the vaccine will be limited, our efforts, as directed by state and federal authorities, will focus on vaccinating our frontline staff and the first responders in southwest Montana.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  More than 450 associates, plus 100 physicians and advanced care professions work at St. James. The hospital said it will \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"encourage all associates to get vaccinated as soon as possible based on vaccine availability.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  Both St. James and St. Vincent said they have have purchased ultra-cold freezers that reaches negative 80 degrees Celsius, the temperature at which the Pfizer vaccine must be stored.  Kalispell Regional Healthcare said they have nearly 4,000 employees across their system. That hospital has multiple cold-storage options, including an ultra-cold freezer that can safely hold more than 26,000 doses the Pfizer vaccine for up to six months.  Bozeman Heath says it has 2,332 employees and will prioritize, at the state's request, frontline, clinical, hospital-based health care workers in the first round of vaccines.  The Bozeman hospital also said it has a task force, led by its Incident Command medical technical specialists, that is developing its approach to prioritization. It also said it has storage to accommodate the Pfizer vaccine, and has ordered additional units.  In Missoula, Community Medical Center said it will focus on prioritizing vaccines for health care workers who have direct patient contact within 6 feet, which follows the state and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines. That will include people who provide services to patients or patients' family members, people who handle infectious materials, and people who work in inpatient or outpatient settings. That hospital has 1,110 employees and 300 medical staff.  Providence St. Patrick Hospital in Missoula referred questions back to the state.  At St. Peter's Health in Helena, a multidisciplinary team meets regularly to develop the hospital's internal vaccine distribution plan for the nearly 1,700 employees and 150 medical staff.  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Per the plan, we will prioritize employees who care for seriously or critically ill patients with COVID-19 and those who are at higher risk of exposure in the workplace, like our Urgent Care team at the Regional Medical Center (hospital), who exclusively provides care to people exhibiting COVID-19 symptoms,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" a hospital spokeswoman said in an email.  St. Peter's received an ultra-cold freezer last week that is capable of storing thousands of vials of the Pfizer vaccine. The hospital is also having conversations with other community organizations, including local public health officials, to develop plans for future vaccine distribution phases.  In Great Falls, Kaci Hused, the vice president of communications and business development at Benefis Health System, said that hospital has 3,350 employees. It\"}"
