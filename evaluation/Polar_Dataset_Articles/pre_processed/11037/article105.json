Savannah Guthrie/Instagram  3 Savannah Guthrie jokes she got a 'little hot and bothered' during threesome bit at the 2024 Paris Olympics opening ceremony. Savannah Guthrie/Instagram  The pre-taped bit showed three dancers in a library passing a book called, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Le Triomphe De L'Amour,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" which translates to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"The Triumph of Love.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  After leaving the library, the colorfully dressed group spilled onto the streets of Paris before rushing up a spiral staircase. One person at the center almost kissed each of their friends before they hurried into an apartment and began making out and nuzzling one another.  But before things got any steamier, one person looked directly at the camera with a devilish smile and shut the door, leaving the rest to the audience's imagination.  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"We are uninvited, well, OK,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Kelly Clarkson quipped. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"That was just rude.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  The official Olympics account on X, formerly known as Twitter, posted a photo of the three revelers with a quote from Victor Hugo: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"The freedom to love is no less sacred than the freedom to think.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  The freedom to love is no less sacred than the freedom to think.    -Victor Hugo#Paris2024 #OpeningCeremony pic.twitter.com/LDCO7nXNoR - The Olympic Games (@Olympics) July 26, 2024  Providing some context about why the segment may have been included in the show, NBC Olympics primetime host Mike Tirico explained that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"the artistic director, Thomas Jolly, decided to lean into some of the clich\\\\\\\\u00e9s about France.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  He added, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"The City of Light, known as a romantic city. So much literature written or set here involves love. So in this segment, love and literature the twain shall meet. Or maybe we should say trois.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  3 Savannah Guthrie and Hoda Kotb.
