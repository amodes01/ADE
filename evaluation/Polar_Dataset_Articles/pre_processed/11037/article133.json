In that work, the gods are sitting at a long table, with Apollo, the sun god, at the center. There is also a child at the meal, matching the child in the Olympic performance that angered some viewers.  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Does this painting remind you of something?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" the museum wrote on X after the ceremony's conclusion. (The similarities were also pointed out by a handful of social media users with deep art historical knowledge.)

He was playing the role of the Greek deity Dionysus, god of wine-for which France is well known-and festivity, and father of Sequana, the goddess of the Seine river.  Skin painted bright blue and nearly nude, he was revealed beneath a giant silver cloche surrounded by fruit like the main course of the feast. In all, it was a tribute to French joie de vivre, as well as the nation's reputation for gastronomic excellence.  The official Olympics social media account shared a photo of the scene, noting that the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"interpretation of the Greek God Dionysus makes us aware of the absurdity of violence between human beings.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  The interpretation of the Greek God Dionysus makes us aware of the absurdity of violence between human beings. #Paris2024 #OpeningCeremony pic.twitter.com/FBlQNNUmvV - The Olympic Games (@Olympics) July 26, 2024  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"We wanted to include everyone, as simple as that,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Jolly said at a press conference following the event. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"In France, we have freedom of creation, artistic freedom. We are lucky in France to live in a free country. I did not have any specific messages that I wanted to deliver.

Official statements from various religious groups followed. The French Catholic Church's conference of bishops \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"deplored a ceremony that included scenes of derision and mockery of Christianity.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  And politicians also chimed in, with Mike Johnson, speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, calling the performance \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"shocking and insulting to Christian people around the world,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" on X.  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Opening the Olympics by insulting billions of Christians around the world was a really bad start, dear French,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Matteo Salvini, the leader of Italy's far-right League party and the nation's deputy prime minister, added.  In response, the Olympic organizers did issue an apology.  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Clearly there was never an intention to show disrespect to any religious group.
