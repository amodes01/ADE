We were in medal territory, and Marschall had no more lives left to use.  It was not to be. The tumbling bar meant Marschall finished sixth, a creditable return and a wiping clean of the slate left dirtied by Tokyo.  Kurtis Marschall falls short of a medal, but finishes a creditable sixth. (Reuters: Kai Pfaffenbach)  Kendricks and Karalis would take the silver and bronze respectively, each celebrating as if they were gold.  But Mondo wasn't done yet.  Duplantis has spent the last four years steadily setting and breaking his own world records. The best eight jumps in history belong to the Swede, and the only thing left to decide in Paris, apart from the silver and bronze medals, was whether Mondo could crack 6.25m and make that nine.  First up, the Olympic record. It had sat at 6.03 for eight years, so Duplantis whacked the bar up to 6.10 and cleared it with room to spare.  There was no need for any more build up.  The bar was set at 6.25, the world record was in play, and the crowd was expectant - at this point it would have come as a surprise if he did not make history.  His first jump was close, but his trail arm clipped the bar on the way down. The second was less convincing.  Duplantis took his time. The crowd sang and danced and threatened to explode.  By the time he took his position, with Marschall and Kendricks leading the cheer squad just to his left, the collective will of 75,000 people could have lifted him over that bar even if the pole did not.  Mondo elevated, extended, recoiled and released.  The bar was not so much as brushed, and the roof came off the Stade de France.  No man has ever soared higher - Mondo Duplantis breaks the world record. (Getty Images: Hanna Peters)  There are no limits on what Duplantis's future could hold. His records will surely continue to tumble, and he conceivably could yet have two more Olympic campaigns to come.  He is absurdly marketable, looking so much like actor Jeremy Allen White that it is jarring to see him here, rather than in the kitchen of The Bear swearing at his cousin and perfecting his list of non-negotiables.  He is laser-focused, impossibly cool and beyond talented.  He is going to take this sport to previously unthinkable heights.  Kurtis Marschall had a front row seat to history. It's not a level he - or maybe anyone - could hope to reach, but he will forever be able to say he threw everything he had at the best there will ever be.\"}"
