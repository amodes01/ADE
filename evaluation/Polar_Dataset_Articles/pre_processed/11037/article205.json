"{\"uid\": \"article205\", \"text\": \"eliminate facilities for other users at Cole Park, a popular neighborhood public park. Dallas Morning News staff seem to have accommodated this PR blitz with several Metro front-page stories and photo spreads.  What is the editorial basis for The News basically giving the thumbs up to one special interest group's decision to mob this one specific public park? Dallas County has 2.7 million people occupying around 900 square miles. Surely there are additional places for picklers to congregate and other more representative city issues for The News to cover.  Anne McDonald, Dallas  Advertisement  Olympic reporting praised  Just a quick note to express how much I have appreciated Kevin Sherrington's Olympic reporting. His writing style really grabbed my attention and kept me interested. I felt like I was right there watching the action in person.  I usually read his articles before seeing the events myself, but that made it only all the more exciting to watch the recordings after the fact, equipped with all the insider details and knowledge provided by Kevin. Great job!  Robert Choate, Little Elm  Advertisement  Johnson a gifted truth teller  Re: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Remembering local civil rights allies - Dallas was not friendly to the movement, but there were some shining lights,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" by Peter Johnson, Sunday Opinion.  Thank you for adding Peter Johnson as a contributing columnist. He is an essential voice from our community. First, he's been on the front lines of civil rights activism here in Dallas for decades. He is a gifted truth teller.  His latest column is a splendid example. He drew attention to the late Bishop Mark Herbener, who was a courageous voice for justice when that was dangerous in Dallas.  Advertisement  And then he gave much overdue attention to Sister Patricia Ridgley, who is also a champion of justice in Dallas. Both are great examples of people of faith doing courageous things.  In a time requiring courage to stand up for civil rights, it's extremely important to hear the stories of people like the Rev. Peter Johnson, who has been doing this work his entire life. Thank you for adding his voice here.  Bill Holston, Dallas/Casa View  We welcome your thoughts in a letter to the editor. See the guidelines and submit your letter here.
