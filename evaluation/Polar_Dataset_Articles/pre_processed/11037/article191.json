"{\"uid\": \"article191\", \"text\": \"Simone Biles hits back at trolls for hairstyle at Olympics  Piers Morgan has publicly admitted to being wrong about Simone Biles after the 27-year-old athlete became the most decorated gymnast in history. In a 2021 MailOnline column, the broadcaster brutally criticised the champion for withdrawing from the Tokyo Olympics for mental health reasons and was met with backlash. At the time, she was due to take part in all four parts of the women's team final gymnastics competition as the leader of Team USA. In his scathing article, he wrote: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"The world's greatest ever gymnast, a woman who proudly told me how she fought back after making big mistakes to win Gold, just gave up at the first hurdle of these Olympics. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"She left her team to fight on without their leader and supreme motivational champion, and rather than win the Gold medal they were hot favourites to win, they came second to the Russians.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  Simone Biles is the most decorated gymnast in history  In the brutal take-down, he continued: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"You are not just at these Games for yourself, Simone. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"You are part of Team USA, representing the United States of America, and hundreds of millions of American people watching back home, not to mention all the sponsors who have paid huge sums to support you. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"And when you quit, you were performing as part of a gymnastics team, not yourself.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Piers' harsh criticism continued on Twitter, where he wrote: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Are 'mental health issues' now the go-to excuse for any poor performance in elite sport? What a joke.
