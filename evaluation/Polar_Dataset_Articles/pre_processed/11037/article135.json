"{\"uid\": \"article135\", \"text\": \"problems, he says population change has been badly managed by the local authority and businesses have been free to exploit migrant workers and depress wages.  Gleeson thinks that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"the failure of authorities to react quickly enough to the change in population meant that local communities were hurt.  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"But that was nothing to do with the EU and nothing to do with where the workers came from.  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"They were needed because we had the work for them. It is not immigration, it's exploitation of new workers that has affected people in this town.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  At Swojskie Jadlo, a family-owned Polish restaurant near West Street, 30-year-old Karol Sokolowski says he does not understand why Leave voters have such a problem with the Polish community.  Before opening the restaurant, Sokolowski says he toiled in local factories where many of his friends are still employed.  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Me and my family and most of my friends are working really hard,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" he says from behind the counter.  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Most do not take benefits. If somebody says we as Polish people are stealing jobs or taking benefits they should look around and see that we are working.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  Increase in racist attacks  Lithuanian community leader Jurate Matulioniene says that the media is partly to blame for Boston's large percentage of Leave voters. Matulioniene arrived in the UK with her daughter six years ago and set up the Boston Lithuanian Community, which puts on events and meets with other local groups. But she says their work receives little attention.  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"It was about newspapers and the media,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" she says, sitting under the shadow of St Botolph's Church, one the largest parish churches in the UK, and pulling nervously on the drawstring of a sweatshirt.  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"We have been working hard for integration. We try to organise events together. We always ask the English community. We have done lots of good things but not so many articles have been published,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Matulioniene says.  Since last week's result, a surge in street harassment has been reported across the UK.  In Hammersmith, west London, racist graffiti was daubed on a Polish community centre and in Huntington, near Cambridge, leaflets saying \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Leave the EU/No More Polish Vermin\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" were posted to the houses of Polish residents.

According to a despairing Gleeson, Boston post-Brexit is now more fragmented than ever.  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"We have let the genie out of the bottle,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Gleeson says. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"They right now feel that they have this sort of carte blanche to be foul and obnoxious to people.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  At Swojskie Jadlo, Sokolowski says a number of his friends working in the town's food-processing factories have faced hostility since the referendum.  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Nobody has been racist to me personally but I have heard things from a few of my customers who work in the factories like 'After the referendum you can pack up and go home'.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  Standing by the bar, one of Sokolowski's customers, a 34-year-old Polish factory worker who gives his name as Patrick, says his wife was accosted on the street on the day of the referendum.  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"A man told her to stop using a foreign language,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" he says. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I am afraid about the English people attacking. People are becoming aggressive for no reason. I am worried about my future and my family's future.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  What happens to the legal status of EU migrants already living and working in the UK is now unclear.
