Local TikTok and Instagram personality Colin McConnell, who goes by Colin313 on TikTok, set off on his journey July 22 and just arrived back in Detroit Saturday, August 3. He rode 683 miles and has raised more than $7,000. He did it while wearing Hawaiian shirts made by 21 Pineapple, a company founded by his friend Nate Simon, who is a Special Olympics athlete with down syndrome.  McConnell shared his entire journey on his TikTok and Instagram to raise awareness for the cause.  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Hundred percent worth it, we brought a community together and helped people,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" McConnell said of his ride. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"It's just amazing to see how much joy the organization brings people, so if I can just help a few athletes and keep this thing going and my community helped as well, it's pretty awesome.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  McConnell is still collecting donations, you can make a donation HERE.
