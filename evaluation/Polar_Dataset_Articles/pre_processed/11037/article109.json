"{\"uid\": \"article109\", \"text\": \"Gordon Brown (The key lesson of Brexit is that globalisation must work for all of Britain, 29 June) writes: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"The commission I propose should examine the most controversial issue arising from the free movement of capital, labour, goods and services - namely migration.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Migration might be controversial but it follows from the free movement of capital across national borders. Under the Bretton Woods-governed international economic order, national economies were spared, for a time, the free flow of speculative financial flows. The freedom to move financial capital in and out of national economies creates instability of currencies, volatility in commodity prices, and short-term profit taking rather than sustainable long-term investment. In the US Treasury Harry Dexter White argued that capital flows were designed to evade \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"new taxes or burdens of social legislation\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". Keynes, for the UK Treasury, wrote: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"There is no country which can, in future, safely allow the flight of funds for political reasons or to evade domestic taxation or in anticipation of the owner turning refugee.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Is Mr Brown prepared to assert the rights of nation states to control capital flows?  Sam Whimster  Global Policy Institute  Gordon Brown has it right - up to a point. The issue is not just about the EU or even about national politics. It's about globalisation. But what do we do about it? More committees? More \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"in-depth scrutiny\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"? More thought about the role of Scotland (and presumably other sub-national as well as national jurisdictions)? We can not just \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"take back control\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" because control is no longer in the hands of national politicians or even European-level policymaking. The problem is much broader. It requires a global approach - a fundamental shift away from the austerian, neoliberal, free marketeering kind of globalisation that became embedded in national life in both developed and developing countries, in the EU and in the fragmented attempts at \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"global governance\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" that took root in the late 20th century. It needs a revised and updated version of the mixed economy and welfare state: a revived social contract that supports growth, provides efficient public goods, enables social mobility for ordinary people, limits inequality, and protects the most vulnerable.  This needs to be pursued not only at domestic level, or even at EU level, though the revival of the notion of a \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"social Europe\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" would be a start. It requires new forms of international cooperation on such matters as a financial transactions tax, a wealth tax of the kind proposed by Thomas Piketty, the increased regulation of markets and, most of all, an ideological shift away from the kind of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"efficient markets\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" theory that has been dominant in both academic economics and economic policymaking in recent decades.  We need a new global social contract. Brexit, unfortunately, just fragments the process and makes the problem worse.  Philip Cerny  Professor emeritus of politics and global affairs, University of Manchester and Rutgers University  Gordon Brown is wrong in thinking that economic globalisation, which has made life so precarious and insecure for the majority in most countries, can ever be \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"made to work for all\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". Its European manifestation of open borders to the free movement of people, goods, capital and services has ensured that working people across the EU have been forced to increasingly compete with each other to their own personal detriment, but to the benefit of big business and finance. The Brexit vote showed that those disadvantaged by this process grasp this\"}"
