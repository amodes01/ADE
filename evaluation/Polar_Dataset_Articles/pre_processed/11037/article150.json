"{\"uid\": \"article150\", \"text\": \"will magically drop people off in front of the shopping and restaurant meccas like Beverly Hills? I highly doubt it.  How will they accomplish this grandiose car ban? By borrowing around 3,000 buses from cities across the U.S. How many of them will be electric? I hear Jackson Hole has a few electric buses sitting idle right now\\\\\\\\u2026because the manufacturer went bankrupt. But hey! If LA can get them running, more power to them.  Paris Olympics: we have a walkable and bike-able city with a robust transit system for people to use  Los Angeles Olympics: we need to borrow buses from around the country and beg employers to go remote for 17 days so we will not have crippling traffic https://t.co/RFencUdlH9 pic.twitter.com/SCyfPMOPj2 - Infrastructure Week (@InfraWeek) August 10, 2024  As many are pointing out, Los Angeles is about 500+ square miles. Quite a number of Olympic events will be held around LA. Not IN LA. See the Temecula reference above.  We want to see the Festival Trail a \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"22-mile, nonvehicular, linear park, a walking and biking corridor that would connect most of the major venues, similar to the way Paris put in this amazing network of dedicated lanes connecting a lot of the venues.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" https://t.co/ERxGh8W65A - Move LA Transit (@MoveLATransit) August 11, 2024  Today's commute from L.A. to Temecula by car is 1 1/2 hours IF traffic is running smoothly. It's over THREE hours by bus. And these fools want to build cute little walking trails for event attendees to use? Wow.  Also, she has a plan for that pesky homeless situation. All 75,000 + will be housed by then. And\\\\\\\\u2026  They will just have crackhead hobos pull people around in rickshaws https://t.co/X3kgpCOSc9 - Sunny (@sunnyright) August 11, 2024  That's quite the visual!  Yet Karen Bass gleefully announces that the 2028 Olympics will involve banning cars.  I can tell you one thing. Karen herself along with all the politicians, except for Kamala who just LOVES her some buses!, and beautiful people will NOT be using public transportation during the Olympics. Nope, the chauffeurs will be making bank during that 2 1/2 week stretch.  Karen Bass can \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"try\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" to ban cars from the 2028 Olympics all she wants, but reality will bite bigly if she tries to push it through.
