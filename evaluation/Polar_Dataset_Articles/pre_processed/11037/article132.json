"{\"uid\": \"article132\", \"text\": \"Cardinal Raymond Burke has become one of the highest-ranking Catholic Church officials to address the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"abominable mockery\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" during the opening ceremony of the Paris Olympics when a parody of the Last Supper was performed with drag queens and LGBT individuals representing Christ and the Apostles.    He made his remarks about \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"an unbelievable manifestation of the darkness and sin in our world\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" during a homily given on 31 July to mark the 16th Anniversary of the dedication of the Church at the Shrine of Our Lady of Guadalupe at La Crosse in Wisconsin.    In addition to addressing the particular incident and manifestation that caused so much shock and consternation throughout the Catholic Church , he also analysed its place in the wider context of what has become of France, with a culture \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"beset with the darkness and sin which is ever more given place in the world and even in the Church\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and which cooperates with \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"the father of all lies\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".    The cardinal also highlighted that what occurred in Paris was but one of many other manifestations permitted in modern secular society \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"of attacks on human life and its cradle in the family created by the marriage of a man and a woman, and attacks on religion itself and its free exercise\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".  The section of his homily that dealt with the ceremony was posted to his X social media account and reads as follows:  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"On this past Friday, we witnessed an unbelievable manifestation of the darkness and sin in our world: the abominable mockery of the Holy Eucharist at its Institution for the opening of the Summer Olympics in Paris.    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"It is difficult to imagine anything more debased and blasphemous. That such an act could take place shows us, in a most painful way, how what was once a Christian culture has become the theatre of Satan and those who cooperate with his thoroughly evil plans, the plans of 'a murderer from the beginning' who 'has nothing to do with the truth', the plans of 'a liar and the father of lies' (Jn 8, 44).  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Our disgust and anger about what happened at the Summer Olympics awakens anew our consciousness of so many other manifestations of the open rebellion against God and His plan for our salvation in the world in which we live: attacks on human life and its cradle in the family created by the marriage of a man and a woman, and attacks on religion itself and its free exercise.    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"In the Church, too, we witness the deliberate spread of confusion and error regarding the truths of our faith, the secularisation of the Sacred Liturgy, and the lack of respect for the irreplaceable foundation of charity in the respect for justice and the rule of law.  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"What are we, sinners yet humble and contrite of heart, to do? We must turn daily to Our Lord and seek from Him, through His Mother, the Mother of Divine Grace, the sevenfold gift of the Holy Spirit for the transformation of our lives and of whatever part of His vineyard Our Lord has entrusted to our care, beginning with our homes.    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"We must never forget the words of Our Lord as He began His Public Ministry: 'The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent, and believe in the gospel' (Mk 1, 15). Christ Who promised to remain with us in His holy Church until the Last Day speaks the truth to us and gives us the grace to live the truth.    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Through the unbroken line of the Apostles and their Successors, Christ is with us to heal and strengthen us for the battle against darkness and sin, the battle in which, in Him, we are the victors. It only remains for us, in the words of Saint Paul, to fight the good fight, to stay the course, and to keep the Faith. (Cf. 1 Tim 6, 11-19; 2\"}"
