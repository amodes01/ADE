"{\"uid\": \"article309\", \"text\": \"message to make it stop.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  Down with experts  Robert Shapiro, a fellow with the Center for Business and Public Policy at Georgetown's McDonough School of Business and formerly Under Secretary of Commerce for Economic Affairs in the Bill Clinton administration, goes a step further in linking the Trump and Brexit campaigns.  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Fundamentally, they are both appeals to nationalism, and to a nationalism defined in racial or ethnic terms by specifying which ethnicities do not belong to the nation,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" said Shapiro, who is also chairman of the economics and security advisory firm Sonecon. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"For Trump that's Hispanics or Muslims, and for the Brexit advocates it's Europeans and Muslims again.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  The overlap does not end there. Another attitude commonly found among Trump and Brexit supporters is a deep-seated lack of trust in political leaders and official institutions, Conley said.  U.K. Justice Minister and Brexit proponent Michael Gove articulated this view recently in saying that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"people in this country have had enough of experts.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" That echoes a sentiment shared by many Trump supporters who say they prefer a political outsider unafraid to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"tell like it is.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  In a recent CBS focus group moderated by Republican strategist Frank Luntz, for instance, two Trump advocates aired their grievances with the Republican establishment. One woman said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"They have not been listening to us.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" While one man responded, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"The party has left us! I am voting for a man or woman that wants to change this country.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  Wrong answer  In part, that's because of a widespread conviction that mainstream political parties have failed to provide solutions for the kind of economic hardships caused by globalization and worsened by the 2008 financial crisis. Trump and Brexit backers both condemn their respective leaders for, in their views, failing to adequately respond to issues such as stagnant wages and slowing economic growth.  And behind that perceived failure in political leadership? A doctrinaire embrace of the kind of free market absolutism that has eroded the financial security and economic prospects of millions of people across most Western democracies.  Although political leaders are eager to address such problems, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Their only only answer is that this was inevitable, that these are market forces and nothing can be done, that the market is a force of nature and all you can do is find ways of adapting,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Kaletsky said.  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"The tragic and very dangerous irony of both the Trump and Brexit movements is that the people who have been hurt, or whose interests have been most seriously damaged by free market forces over the last 30 years, are supporters of Trump and Brexit,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" he added. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"They are turning to political movements that have no other answer than let us have more markets.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\"}"
