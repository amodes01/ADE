He also arguably held the largest media presence of the American billionaires until Musk rocketed into the top slot.  Advertisement  None of the other recent wealthiest men have come close to Musk's super PAC spending. Bezos made the biggest splash in 2018 when they donated $10 million to With Honor, a super PAC that supported veteran candidates. Unlike America PAC, though, With Honor was geared to support candidates from both parties.  Both Buffett and Bezos also held or held stakes in media companies. Bezos still owns The Washington Post (which, full disclosure, previously employed me.) But neither man positioned those publications in the way Musk has harnessed X.  Of the unofficial group, Buffett was arguably the best positioned for a career in politics. While he's most associated with Nebraska's largest city, he was born in the nation's capital, the son of an avowed anti-Communist congressman. Instead, he has pursued a much softer and less public power flexing.  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"He's a pretty good listening post, and for those who want, a pretty good advice giver,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Lowenstein said. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"That way, he has a lot of influence.
