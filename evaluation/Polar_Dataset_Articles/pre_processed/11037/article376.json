Hunter, a three-time medal winner at the Summer Paralympics Games, lost his legs when he was 11 months of age due to a congenital birth defect. He competes using advanced carbon fiber blades in the 100, 200, and 400-meter categories of track and field, excelling in the sport since his international debut in 2015.  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I really credit my parents and brothers for never letting me use it as an excuse and pushing me to do everyday things like ride a bike. My mom would always say, 'It's not that you can not do something; you just have to find a different way to do it,'\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" he said in an interview with Travel and Leisure.

Tara is a woman of color. I have a disability. We want people to know that whoever you are, whatever situation you are in, it's okay and that's what makes you special and unique,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" the pair wrote in an interview with Archewell.

Sure, when we are at beach destinations, there are things I probably should not do, like go in the saltwater with my prosthetics, but I just love experiencing things, so I try not to let my disability get in the way.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  Share icon  Image credits: hunterwoodhall  They also support each other fiercely in all facets of life, competition included, as Hunter demonstrated by posting a heartwarming message on his Instagram ahead of his wife's performance at the Olympics.  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tomorrow you contend for the Olympic Title,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" the statement reads.  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I am so humbled by you.
