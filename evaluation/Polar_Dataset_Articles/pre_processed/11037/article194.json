Advertisement  It took around three months and 33 different departments to produce the glittering leotards worn by the US women's gymnastics team at the 2024 Paris Olympics.  The process began with GK Elite conducting a survey asking athletes about their preferred colors, necklines, fabrics, crystal coverage, and other design elements, GK Elite lead designer Jeanne Diaz told Business Insider. The sportswear company then collaborated with USA Gymnastics and a panel of former athletes to create the designs. Finally, the leotards were sewn at GK Elite's in-house manufacturing floor in Reading, Pennsylvania.  With custom fabrics and thousands of crystals, each leotard is valued at around $5,000, Diaz said.  The Olympic athletes themselves did not see any of the final leotard designs until they were named to the team, a reveal that Diaz described as \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"a really special moment.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  Advertisement  For the 2024 Olympics, the GK Elite design team took inspiration from the host city of Paris, incorporating French fashion elements and paying tribute to the City of Light.  The leotards are still unmistakably American with nods to Fourth of July fireworks and the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Star-Spangled Banner\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in red, white, and blue.  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Under the arena lights, some of that detail might get lost, but that's OK because the detail is also for the athletes to feel confident, and that confidence will hopefully translate to their performances,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Diaz said.  Here are hidden details you may have missed in Team USA's leotard designs.\"}"
