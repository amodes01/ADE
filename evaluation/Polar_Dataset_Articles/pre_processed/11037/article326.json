"{\"uid\": \"article326\", \"text\": \"participants shuck a bushel of scallops, emceed by Matt Merry, a good friend of the preservation trust, Edmundson said.  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Paris has the Olympics, Menemsha has scallop shucking,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Merry said.  The shuckers worked in almost complete silence and total focus as they opened the shell, cut away the stomach sack and excess parts, grabbed the muscle, and chucked the rest away.  The only noise heard other than the scraping and throwing and light intense music coming from one guitarist to simulate time ticking away were the cheers from the crowd and emcee as contestants got closer and closer to the bottom of the bucket. Front row spectators were warned that they were in the splash zone of scallop guts.  Otto Osmers became the clear winner as his bucket emptied and Merry shouted, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Otto-matic!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Someone in the crowd added, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Otto-zone!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Osmers, also a commercial fisherman, won the shucking competition for the second year in a row, taking home $1,000 and bragging rights.  The event raised over $63,000 from sponsors. The money goes to the fishing preservation trust after expenses.  1,000 and bragging rights.  The event raised over $63,000 from sponsors.
