Similarly, Barbara Butch, a lesbian who donned a silver headdress and low-cut dress while portraying the figure of Jesus in the Last Supper parody, said the opening ceremony was intended to bring people together.  According to her Instagram profile, Butch is \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"a Love activist, Dj and producer based in Paris. My aim is to unite people, gather humans & share love through music for all of Us to dance & make our hearts beat (in unison)! Music sounds better with all of Us!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  Butch posted an image of the drag parody of the Last Supper above an image of Da Vinci's original painting to her Instagram account with the comment, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Oh yes! Oh yes! The new gay testament!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The post was subsequently deleted.  Despite the Olympic Committee's apology, many Catholic leaders and commentators have said it does not go far enough and fails to make amends for the offense give to the world's 2.6 billion Christians.  In a July 28 video published on social media platform X, previously known as Twitter, Bishop Robert Barron of Winona-Rochester, Minnesota, founder of the popular Word on Fire ministry which is a benefactor of Crux, criticized the apology.  Barron, who had previously published a video condemning the Last Supper parody, said Descamps' words were \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"anything but an apology.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"In fact, it's kind of a masterpiece of woke duplicity \\\\\\\\u2026 If they felt this is meant to mollify Christians, I would think again,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" he said.  Pointing to Descamps's assertion that they did not intend to offend any religious group, Barron said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Give me a break.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"We have a group of drag queens cavorting in a sexually provocative way clearly in imitation of Da Vinci's Last Supper, which presents to the world the Last Supper of Jesus, and no disrespect was meant? Do you think anyone takes that seriously?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" he said.  He also took issue with the statement that the intention was to celebrate community and tolerance, saying there is tolerance \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"except for those pesky 2.6 billion Christians on the planet.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Everyone's welcome, everyone's tolerated, all this lovely diversity, until you get to anyone that disagrees with your ideology, like these 2.6 billion people. So do not give me this business about tolerance and diversity,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" he said.  Referring to Descamps's statement that their goal of celebrating tolerance was achieved, Barron asked rhetorically, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I wonder what planet they are living on if they think that harmony and peace and all this was achieved by this clear affront to Christians.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  Barron also condemned the wording of the apology as condescending, saying the tone does not read apologetic, but rather says, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"if you are so simple minded and stupid to have been offended by this wonderful expression of French culture, well, we are sorry about that.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Christians were offended because it was offensive. And it was intended to be offensive. So please do not patronize us with this condescending remark of, 'well, if you had any bad feelings, we are awfully sorry about that,'\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" he said.  This apology will do little to satisfy Christians who were offended by the performance, he said, saying, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"A real apology would be something like, 'this was a mistake, it should never have been done, we are sorry for it.'\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I do not think Christians should be mollified, I think we should keep raising our voices,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" he said.  Similarly, the German Bishops' Conference published a statement Monday saying the argument by organizers that the scene was intended to depict Greek mythology \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"is not convincing,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" as the sequence\"}"
