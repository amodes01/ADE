"{\"uid\": \"article154\", \"text\": \"Archbishop Charles Scicluna, who serves as archbishop of Malta and as adjunct secretary of the disciplinary section of the Vatican's Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith, lodged a formal complaint with the French ambassador to Malta, and has urged others to do the same.  In his complaint, which he published on social media, Scicluna said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I would like to express my distress and great disappointment at the insult to us Christians during the opening ceremony of the Paris 2024 Olympics when a group of drag artists parodied the Last Supper of Jesus.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  Bishop Andrew Cozzens of Crookston, Minnesota, who serves as Chairman of the Board of the National Eucharistic Congress and who in that capacity recently presided over the event in Indianapolis, which drew some 50,000 people, sent a response to all congress participants about the Olympic performance.  In his July 27 statement, Cozzens pointed to the irony that, shortly after tens of thousands coming together to venerate the Eucharist, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Nearly 1 billion men, women, and children, in person and through live telecast, witnessed the public mockery of the Mass.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  Da Vinci's Last Supper, he said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"was depicted in heinous fashion, leaving us in such shock, sorry and righteous anger that words cannot describe it.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  Cozzens urged Christians, and Catholics in particular, to respond with prayer and fasting, saying, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"We are invited to enter into this moment of passion with him, this moment of public shame, mockery, and persecution.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"We do this through prayer and fasting,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" he said, urging Catholics to pray at Sunday Mass for \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"healing and forgiveness for all those who participated in this mockery.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  For those who speak publicly about the performance, Cozzens urged Christians to speak clearly, but with charity.  Bishop Robert Barron of Winona-Rochester, Minnesota, founder of the popular Word on Fire ministry which is a benefactor of Crux, joined the chorus.  In a video post on X, Barron said the parody reflected a \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"deeply secularist postmodern society\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and represented \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"gross mockery.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  Barron questioned why France, which prides itself on a culture of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"honoring the individual and of human rights and freedom\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" based on the country's Christian roots, chose to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"mock the Christian faith.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  He urged Christians and Catholics to not be passive, but to make their \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"voices heard.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  Jewish commentators and people of other faiths also decried the performance on social media.  In their statement, the French bishops thanked members of other religious denominations who have reached out in the wake of the opening ceremony to express \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"their solidarity with us.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"This morning, we think of all the Christians of all the continents who have been hurt by the excess and provocation of certain scenes,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" they said, and voiced hope that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"they understand that the Olympic celebration extends far beyond the ideological biases of a few artists.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  Sport, the bishops said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"is a wonderful human activity that deeply rejoices the hearts of athletes and spectators. Olympism is a movement at the service of this reality of unity and human fraternity.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Let us get to the field of competitions, may it bring truth, consolation and joy to all!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" they said.
