"{\"uid\": \"article227\", \"text\": \"08 Jul 2016  The decision by the people of Great Britain to leave the European Union not only left political chaos in its wake, but also roiled neuroscientists across the United Kingdom. Researchers there fret that the decision will cut them off from EU funds and international projects, and discourage European students and postdocs from joining their labs. Many foresee that collaborative research will become more complicated, difficult, and slow. Some worry about the future viability of projects that depend on international consortia. Ironically, this setback comes at a time when a growing emphasis on large multinational initiatives has begun to propel neurodegenerative research forward. Scientists in all fields overwhelmingly wanted to remain and have reacted with alarm to the outcome of the June 23 vote, as reported by Science and Nature.  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I am bitterly disappointed by the Brexit decision-it was a dark day for U.K. science,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Adrian Isaacs at University College London wrote to Alzforum. Bart De Strooper at KU Leuven in Belgium concurred, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"The Brexit vote has shocked me, and from the reactions I hear at the conference I am attending, it is creating a lot of confusion and uncertainty among the British and to a lesser extent the European scientific community.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (See full comment below.) De Strooper holds a joint appointment at UCL.  Politicians have not laid out any clear plan for the U.K.'s future relationship with Europe. Much depends on whether the U.K. remains in the European Economic Area, a route followed by Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein, or negotiates its own set of bilateral agreements with the EU for each program it wants to join, as Switzerland does. The former would be less disruptive for research, as the U.K. would stay in the single market with free movement of people between countries; however, this option is unlikely to satisfy \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Leave\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" campaigners who won votes by promising to curb immigration. Whatever model the U.K. settles on, managing international research projects is likely to become more cumbersome, and access to funding may come with more restrictions, scientists say. This may place U.K. researchers at a disadvantage when competing for grants and personnel. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"The U.K. runs the risk of sending a message that it is not a credible international partner for scientific collaboration,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Rick Livesey at the University of Cambridge wrote to Alzforum (see full comment below).  [Vector Open Stock image.]  Currently in science, the U.K. leads the EU as one of its wealthiest and most productive members. Many large multinational projects are headquartered in the U.K., and if U.K. science falters, neurodegenerative research across the continent may suffer as well. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"The outcome of last week's referendum cannot be good for scientific research, which is international and must remain so,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Michel Goedert at MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, wrote. Rita Guerreiro at UCL agreed. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Although the U.K. is an island, science is exactly the opposite. We need collaborations to move it forward,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" she wrote (see full comment below).  EU Funds Drive U.K. Research Engine  The EU is a major player in world science, home to more than one-fifth of all researchers and churning out a third of all papers, according to reports from UNESCO and Science Europe and Elsevier. The U.K. powers the world's fifth-largest economy, and ranks as the second most populous country in the EU, equal with France at 65 million and lagging behind only Germany. Because of this, the U.K. contributes a total of \\\\\\\\u20ac17 billion per year to the EU,\"}"
