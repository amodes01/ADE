"{\"uid\": \"article216\", \"text\": \"- a key component of the EU's plan under the Paris scheme - plunging by close to 20 percent. At first, Figueres and other UN bureaucrats and alarmist politicians may have thought they were bluffing, aiming to keep the British people under the thumb of the EU via fear-mongering. Now, though, the reality is setting in, and the Paris pseudo-treaty is in jeopardy. Figueres may have been wrong about the globalist mantra of centralizing power more and more, or \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"larger and larger tents of collaboration\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" as she put it, but she was right about the threat Brexit poses to the UN's \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"climate\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" machinations.  The unaccountable EU super-state, which now lords over the formerly independent peoples of Europe practically without restraint, pledged at the UN climate summit in Paris to slash the CO 2 emissions of its disenfranchised subjects by 40 percent below 1990 levels by the year 2030. The commitment was \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"to be fulfilled jointly.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" But without the British to endure an outsized dose of the economic pain, loss of prosperity, and diminishing liberty, that lawless pledge by the EU commissars is in serious jeopardy. Indeed, even the globalist push to have regional governments take a leading role in imposing UN schemes may be blowing up in the internationalists' faces.  In Article 4 of the Paris Agreement, for example, the agreement outlines a plan for \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"regional economic integration organizations,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" such as the EU, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"to act jointly\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" under the agreement. It also calls on those regional super-governments to notify the UN bureaucracy of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"the emission level allocated to each Party (national government).\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" In other words, emerging regional governments such as the European Union, the African Union, the Union of South American States, the Eurasian Union, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, and other sovereignty-crushing outfits are expected to play a major role in allocating \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"emission levels\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" to entire nations.  That means illegitimate and unelected bureaucrats will decide how much CO 2 ,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" also known as \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"the gas of life,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" nations will be able to release. In short, it is rationing, on an unprecedented scale, due to false scarcity imposed by internationalists themselves. The implications for liberty and prosperity are gargantuan. Consider that every human activity - including breathing - emits CO 2 . (Though man-made CO2 emissions account for a fraction of one percent of all greenhouse gases naturally in the atmosphere). By purporting to grant regional governments loyal to the UN the power to limit and regulate those emissions, negotiators in Paris attempted to literally hand those regional governments power over life and death, over all energy, all economic activity, and more.  The deal also purports to allow and even encourage regional governments, such as the EU or any of the other super-states being imposed on people around the world, to vote in place of their member states, with the same number of votes as it has member states. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Any regional economic integration organization that becomes a Party to this Agreement \\\\\\\\u2026 shall be bound by all the obligations under this Agreement,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" the Paris deal explains. So if you live under the EU or any other autocratic would-be super-state that signs up to the UN scheme, you can kiss your nation's liberties and self-government goodbye.  In keeping with the globalist strategy for building what its architects often refer to publicly as a \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"New World Order,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" the UN agreement is packed with references to the regional super-governments being used to shackle nations and peoples\"}"
