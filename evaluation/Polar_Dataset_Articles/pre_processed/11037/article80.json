"{\"uid\": \"article80\", \"text\": \"It was another high-profile, high-flying night in Paris this evening, as Simone Biles and Suni Lee represented the United States in the women's individual all-around final. Back at the Bercy Arena after the USA claimed team gold on Tuesday, the pair competed before a crowd including Steph Curry, Martha Stewart, Seth Rogen, Tony Hawk, Kendall Jenner, Tony Parker, Bill Gates, and Zinedine Zidane.  There, Biles's overall score of 59.131 won her another gold medal-ratcheting her career tally up to six-while Brazil's Rebeca Andrade captured the silver and Lee won the bronze. With today's result, Biles became only the third woman in history to win two individual all-around golds at the Olympics, following the Soviet Union's Larisa Latynina (in 1956 and 1960) and Czechoslovakia's Vera Caslavska (in 1964 and 1968).  During the individual all-around, competitors wear their own leotards. Biles's had a blue base with dazzling allover embellishments, while Lee's had more of an ombr\\\\\\\\u00e9 scheme, blending blue and red with an almost Art Deco-style filigree. Both looks were covered in crystals, befitting Team USA's starry status.  As expected, Biles-the most decorated gymnast in history-performed her modified version of the Yurchenko double pike on vault, a move that no one had landed at the Olympic Games until Biles pulled it off in Paris's qualifying rounds. Notably, she did not perform it during the team event; it's a risky, gutsy skill, and Biles and company were said to want to preserve said risk for the individual competition. Well, that strategy paid off: Biles's score of 15.766 quickly put her in the lead.  Next came the uneven bars. After Andrade's routine, it was nice to see her and Biles exchange big smiles and a double fist bump. Biles received a steep deduction when it was her turn; she had too much swing going into her Pak Salto. After the second rotation, Andrade took the lead, with Algeria's Kaylia Nemour in the silver-medal position. Biles was in third.  For their third rotation, Biles and Lee headed to the beam. Biles in particular had a great showing, overtaking the lead from Andrade going into their final discipline: the floor. The atmosphere was tense as the crowd waited for the Brazilian's score-Andrade went last-to see where things stood.\"}"
