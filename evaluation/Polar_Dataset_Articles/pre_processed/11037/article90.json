That's anytime you have a lot of individuals cluster over time together,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" he continued.  The Australian Olympic Committee said last week that 16 athletes tested positive for COVID, at least seven of whom were swimmers.

Ezra Shaw/Getty Images, FILE  The British Olympic Committee said swimmer Adam Peaty tested positive for COVID-19 less than 24 hours after winning silver in the men's 100-meter breaststroke final.  Perhaps, most famous, Lyles -- the American sprinter -- revealed after winning bronze in the 200-meter men's final that he had tested positive two days beforehand. Lyles drew a great deal of criticism for running the race unmasked and not publicly revealing his diagnosis before the competition.  However, experts said that COVID-19 is beginning to be considered an endemic virus, meaning it is typically present, and should be treated like other endemic viruses, like the flu.  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"A lot has changed, and this virus is now what we would call an endemic virus; it's basically part of the new respiratory viruses that circulate within our community,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Piedra said. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"We do not try to test every virus for every illness that we have. If we did, I think it would cost significantly, and on many occasions, we do not have any form of treatment or prevention methods.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  Adalja said because COVID-19 is being considered an endemic respiratory virus, each individual case is less significantly important.  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"We have so many tools that science and medicine have given us that make COVID-19 so much more manageable in 2024 than it was in 2020, 2021, 2022,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" he said. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"So, in that sense, the fact that you are not hearing about every case as it occurs is just like you do not hear about every case of influenza that occurs.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  He continued, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I think that the fact that people are back to their lives, that people are winning medals when they have COVID-19 really shows that despite all of the obstacles the governments put in place to deal with COVID appropriately, scientists, physicians delivered and developed so many tools that were able to now live our lives in the midst of COVID-19 and not have It be as disruptive as it once was.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\"}"
