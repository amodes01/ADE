"{\"uid\": \"article261\", \"text\": \"In the wake of Britain's vote to leave the European Union, Prime Minister David Cameron has announced his resignation - and former mayor of London Boris Johnson is a leading contender to take Cameron's place.    Johnson was the most prominent supporter of the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"leave\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" campaign as voters headed to the polls over the historic decision widely known as Brexit. And, with the results in, Johnson has emerged as the big winner.    In a statement on Friday, Johnson paid tribute to Cameron, calling him \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"brave\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"one of the most extraordinary politicians of our age.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"    Although he did not mention succeeding Cameron, he hailed voters' decision in favor of Brexit.          Who Is Boris Johnson? Leader of Brexit Supporters Could Be Britain's Next Prime Minister| politics, London, Around the Web    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"They have decided it is time to vote to take back control from a European Union that has become too opaque and not accountable enough to the people it is meant to serve,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" he said.    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"And to those who may be anxious both at home and abroad, this does not mean that the United Kingdom will be in any way less united, it does not mean it will be any less European.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"    Johnson, with his shock of wild blonde hair, has gained prominence following the Brexit vote - but just who is the flamboyant politician? Here are four things you need to know about the former London mayor.    1. He Was Born in America    Do not be fooled by his thick British accent, Johnson was born in New York and has held a U.S. passport.        His family lived in the city after his father, Stanley - a prize-winning poet - won a fellowship.    2. He Got Stuck on a Zip-Line During the 2012 London Olympics. No, Really    During a promotional appearance for the London Olympics, the former journalist became stuck on a zip-line and was left dangling as onlookers snapped photos.        The stunt looked promising as Johnson took off down the line, waving two U.K. flags. But things began going downhill - or down line - when he began sliding the opposite way before coming to a halt.    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I want you to know, it's very, very well organized,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" he joked of the event. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Get me a ladder. I think they needed to test it on somebody going a bit faster.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"      Who Is Boris Johnson?

He Faced Backlash After Criticizing President Obama    During Obama's April visit to London to meet with Queen Elizabeth II on her 90th birthday - and to urge Britons to vote against the Brexit - Johnson penned an essay published in The Sun blasting the president's opposition to Brexit.    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"For the United States to tell us in the U.K. that we must surrender control of so much of our democracy - it is a breathtaking example of the principle of so-as-I-say-but-not-as-I-do,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Johnson wrote. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"It is incoherent. It is inconsistent, and yes it is downright hypocritical.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"    He also mentioned a bust of Winston Churchill that was removed from the Oval Office in 2009, writing, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"some said it was a symbol of the part-Kenyan President's ancestral dislike of the British empire.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"    Many condemned Johnson's essay, with Nicholas Soames, a Conservative Parliament member and a grandson of Churchill, calling it an \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"appalling article\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" that is \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"totally wrong on almost everything.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"      Appalling article by @BorisJohnson in Sun totally wrong on almost everything.
