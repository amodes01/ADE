In September 2017, May called this arrangement an unacceptable \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"loss of democratic control.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  David Davis expressed interest in the Norway model in response to a question he received at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in Washington. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"It's something we have thought about, but it's not at the top of our list,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" he said. He was referring specifically to the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), which, like the EEA, offers access to the single market but not the customs union.  The EFTA was once a large organization, but most of its members left to join the EU. Today, it comprises Norway, Iceland, Lichtenstein, and Switzerland; all but Switzerland are also members of the EEA.  The Switzerland Model  Switzerland's relationship with the EU, which is governed by around 20 major bilateral pacts with the bloc, is broadly similar to the EEA arrangement. Along with these three, Switzerland is a member of the European Free Trade Association. Switzerland helped set up the EEA, but its people rejected membership in a 1992 referendum.  The country allows the free movement of people and is a member of the passport-free Schengen Area. It is subject to many single-market rules without having much say in making them.  It is outside the customs union, allowing it to negotiate free trade agreements with third countries; usually, but not always, it has negotiated alongside the EEA countries. Switzerland has access to the single market for goods (with the exception of agriculture) but not services (except insurance). It pays a modest amount into the EU's budget.  Brexit supporters who wanted to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"take back control\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" would not have embraced the concessions that the Swiss made on immigration, budget payments, and single-market rules. The EU would probably not have wanted a relationship modeled on the Swiss example, either: Switzerland's membership in the EFTA but not the EEA, and Schengen but not the EU, is a messy product of the complex history of European integration and-not surprisingly-a referendum.  The Canada Model: A Free Trade Agreement  A third option was to negotiate a free trade agreement with the EU along the lines of the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA), a pact that the EU finalized but did not fully ratify with Canada. The most obvious problem with this approach is that the U.K. had only two years from triggering Article 50 to negotiate such a deal. The EU refused to discuss a future trading relationship until December of that year at the earliest.  To give a sense of how tight that timetable was, CETA negotiations began in 2009 and concluded in 2014. But just over half of the EU's 28 national parliaments ratified the deal. Even subnational legislatures can stand in the way of a deal; the Walloon regional parliament, which represents fewer than four million mainly French-speaking Belgians, single-handedly blocked CETA for a few days in 2016.  To extend the two-year deadline for leaving the EU, Britain needed unanimous approval from the EU. Several U.K. politicians, including Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond, stressed the need for a transitional deal of a few years so that (among other reasons) Britain could negotiate EU and third-country trade deals. But this notion was met with resistance from hardline Brexiteers.  As of 2024, all EU member countries have signed the agreement yet some still need to ratify it, a process that can take two to five years.  Problems With a CETA-Style Agreement  In\"}"
