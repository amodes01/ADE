"{\"uid\": \"article111\", \"text\": \"Boy, 15, arrested on felony counts  A 15-year-old boy was arrested last week after police said he hit a man with a gun and stole money from a unit at a Little Rock housing project.  Jaitwon Lewis, who was arrested Friday at 700 S. Rock St., was charged as an adult with aggravated robbery and first-degree battery, according to an arrest report. He pleaded innocent to the charges Monday in Little Rock District Court.  Officers responding to a report of a robbery at Cumberland Towers, 311 E. Eighth St., at 9:50 a.m. Friday spoke with Marshell Curry, who told them that a minor -- Lewis -- had knocked on his door, then pointed a gun at him and demanded money when he answered, the report says.  Curry told police he grabbed the gun, and during the ensuing scuffle, the gun's magazine fell out and Lewis hit him in the head with the gun, injuring him, according to the report.  Curry said he told Lewis there was money in the kitchen, and Lewis took $190 and left, the report says.  An employee at the front desk told police Lewis had jumped from a balcony and fled on foot.  Lewis was located at 800 S. Cumberland St., but he fled to the backyard of 624 Rock St., police said.  The boy tripped on a mirror and cut his right arm, according to the report, and officers applied a tourniquet to stop heavy bleeding.  After being treated at Arkansas Children's Hospital, Lewis was taken to the Pulaski County jail.\"}"
