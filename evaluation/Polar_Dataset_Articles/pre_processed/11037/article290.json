"{\"uid\": \"article290\", \"text\": \"RIDGELAND, MISSISSIPPI: In a swift reaction to the controversial 2024 Paris Olympics opening ceremonies, Mississippi-based telecommunications and technology company C Spire announced its decision to pull its advertising from the global event.  The drastic move came after a performance during the ceremonies, which included drag queens and dancers, drew quite a backlash for its apparent parody of Leonardo da Vinci's iconic painting, 'The Last Supper'.  C Spire's response to mockery of Olympics performance  C Spire made its stance clear on Saturday morning, July 27, a few hours after the opening ceremony, which had sparked outrage across the globe. The company took to social media platform X (formerly Twitter) to express its dismay.  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"We were shocked by the mockery of the Last Supper during the opening ceremonies of the Paris Olympics. C Spire will be pulling our advertising from the Olympics,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" the company stated.  We were shocked by the mockery of the Last Supper during the opening ceremonies of the Paris Olympics. C Spire will be pulling our advertising from the Olympics. - C Spire (@CSpire) July 27, 2024  In response to inquiries from the New York Post, C Spire declined to provide specific details about the nature of the advertisements pulled or the financial investment involved in their Olympic sponsorship.  However, Suzy Hays, the President and CEO of C Spire, underscored the company's position in a statement: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"C Spire is supportive of our athletes who have worked so hard to be a part of the Olympics. However, we will not be a part of the offensive and unacceptable mockery of the Last Supper, which is why we are pulling our advertising from the Olympics.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  The performance that ignited the controversy took place at the opening of the Paris Olympics, set against the picturesque backdrop of the Eiffel Tower and the Seine River. The segment began with three French drag queens and other elaborately dressed dancers presenting what appeared to be a parody of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"The Last Supper.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  The centerpiece of this act was a bedazzled woman adorned with a large silver headdress resembling a halo, which seemed to mock traditional depictions of Jesus. This figure made a heart shape with her hands, while her peers engaged in a choreographed dance routine.  Following the uproar, Thomas Jolly, the artistic director of the opening ceremony, defended the production during a press conference on Sunday. Jolly explained that the intention behind the performance was to celebrate \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"inclusion\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" rather than to be provocative. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Our subject was not to be subversive. We never wanted to be subversive. We wanted to talk about diversity. Diversity means being together,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Jolly said.  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"We wanted to include everyone, as simple as that. In France, we have freedom of creation, artistic freedom. We are lucky in France to live in a free country. I did not have any specific messages that I wanted to deliver. In France, we are republic, we have the right to love whom we want, we have the right not to be worshippers, we have a lot of rights in France, and this is what I wanted to convey,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" he added.  Jolly further clarified his intentions in a conversation with The Associated Press. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"My wish is not to be subversive, nor to mock or to shock,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" he said. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Most of all, I wanted to send a message of love, a message of inclusion and not at all to divide.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  Religious and political backlash over C Spire's performance  Despite Jolly's explanation, the performance drew sharp criticism from various quarters, particularly from religious conservatives.  Marion Marechal, a practicing Catholic, took to X to express her disapproval: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"To all\"}"
