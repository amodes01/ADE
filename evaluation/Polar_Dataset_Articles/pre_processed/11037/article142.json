"{\"uid\": \"article142\", \"text\": \"Jean-Claude Juncker traveled to Russia to attend the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum. It was the first time an EU leader had visited Russia since sanctions were put in place in March 2014. Still more shocking was German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier's recent description of NATO exercises as \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"saber-rattling and warmongering.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  The UK's voice was more often than not drowned out, overruled and ignored in EU institutions. No longer. It is now free to pursue to hard line vis-\\\\\\\\u00e0-vis Russia's revanchism-and I expect it will do so.  As for the EU, rather than bemoaning the loss of the UK as a tonic to stiffen the union's collective resolve, what it should be doing is getting its own house in order. Debt-ridden, protectionist economies can and should be reformed; the EU can and should retain a hard line against Russia's aggression on the continent.  The idea that Brexit must necessarily lead to Putin cracking the collective will of the EU is anything but inevitable. Why can not the nations of the EU continue to enact sanctions against Russia, with or without the UK? The security situation has remained unchanged, and the nations of the EU are just as vulnerable Russian aggression after Brexit as before.  Blaming Brexit for a softening stance on Russia is exactly the sort of thing a group of nations with deep business interests in Russia and little stomach for continuing to stand up to aggressive behavior might do.  For the EU, the UK's decision should be a stark wake-up call. A one-size-fits-all currency, reams of red tape, shortsighted and baffling open-door policies towards migrants, lack of accountability, and the incessant drive towards centralization of power in Brussels have created the fracturing of Europe, not the UK's sage decision to take back its democracy.  Pro-Russian (and Russian-financed) fringe parties on the continent will supposedly now gain more traction following Brexit. Yet it was and continues to be EU policies and excesses that fueled their growth. A return to policies that promote economic freedom, responsible border control and decentralization of power would do much to extinguish the growth of Russia's fringe friends in Europe.  Yet I fear the EU will soldier along with chants of ever-closer union, as if the same forces that led to Brexit are now the continent's only antidote for it. The EU's immediate decision to exclude twenty-one members from emergency meetings following the Brexit vote leads me to believe my suspicions are correct.  The EU will close ranks and seek ever more political integration-all the while blaming Brexit for problems of its own making, and Putin's supposed masterful manipulation for its own lack of resolve.  For the UK, the special relationship has a chance to grow stronger post-Brexit. Freed from the EU, it can better assist the United States in the lonely role of world leadership. That would certainly mark Brexit a loss for Putin's regime.  Daniel Kochis is Policy Analyst-European Affairs in the Margaret Thatcher Center for Freedom at The Heritage Foundation (heritage.org).
