"{\"uid\": \"article284\", \"text\": \"sister, Gretchen, has won a gold medal and two silvers in Paris.  McIntosh set several world records ahead of the Paris Olympics, and she backed up the enormous expectations by claiming a starring role at La Defense Arena along with L\\\\\\\\u00e9on Marchand and Ledecky.  McIntosh also won gold medals in the 200 butterfly and 400 IM, plus a silver in the 400 freestyle. She fell just 0.88 seconds - the margin of her loss to Titmus - shy of matching Marchand's four individual golds.  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"It's pretty surreal,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" said McIntosh, who became the first Canadian athlete to win three golds in a single Olympics. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I am just so proud of myself and how I have been able to recover and manage events.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  US sets world record in mixed relay  The United States made up for a disappointing showing in Tokyo by setting a world record in the 4x100 mixed medley relay.  Ryan Murphy, Nic Fink, Gretchen Walsh and Torri Huske held off China for a winning time of 3:37.43, breaking the mark of 3:37.58 set by Britain when it won gold in the wild and woolly event's Olympic debut three years ago.  With each team picking two men and two women, the US and China both went with their male swimmers in the first two legs.  Murphy put the US in front on the backstroke, China's Qin Haiyang slipped past Nic Fink on the breaststroke, but Walsh stormed back in front for the Americans on the butterfly before Huske held off Yang Junxuan to secure the gold.  For Huske, it was her second gold to go with two silvers in Paris.  The Chinese team, which also included Xu Jiayu and Zhang Yufei, took silver in 3:37.55. The bronze went to Australia in 3:38.76.  Marchand swam the breaststroke leg for France but could not add to his already impressive haul. The French finished fourth, more than two seconds behind the Aussies.  When the British won gold in 2021, the Americans finished fifth. Britain was seventh this time.  The US bumped its total to six golds, one behind leading Australia with four events remaining Sunday. The Americans are assured of winning the overall medal count with 25.  Hungarian claims butterfly gold  Krist\\\\\\\\u00f3f Mil\\\\\\\\u00e1k of Hungary won the men's 100 butterfly, chasing down three swimmers on the return lap.  Mil\\\\\\\\u00e1k was only fourth at the turn, but he rallied to touch in 49.90. Canada grabbed the silver and bronze, with Josh Liendo finishing in 49.99 and Ilya Kharun next at 50.45.  Mil\\\\\\\\u00e1k had failed to defend his Olympic title in the 200 butterfly, settling for a silver behind Marchand.  Mil\\\\\\\\u00e1k claimed silver in the 100 fly three years ago, but he did not have to worry about the guy who beat him in that race. American Caeleb Dressel stunningly failed to qualify for the final.  Kharun added another bronze to the one he garnered in the 200 butterfly.\"}"
