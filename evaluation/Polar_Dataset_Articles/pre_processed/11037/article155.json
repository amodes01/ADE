In an Instagram Story posted on Sunday, July 28, Sweetin shared a post from activist Matt Bernstein about the tableau that seemingly evoked Leonardo da Vinci's \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"The Last Supper.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"The drag queens at the Olympics were recreating the feast of Dionysus, not the Last Supper,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" the graphic stated. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"And even if you thought it was a Christian reference - what's the harm? Why is it a 'parody' and not a tribute? Can drag queens not be Christian too?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  On Monday, July 29, Sweetin, 42, continued the conversation by sharing a video of comedian Walter Masterson seemingly poking fun at the controversy.

While celebrating the kick-off to the summer Games on Friday, July 26, some viewers questioned a scene where DJ, producer and LGBTQ+ icon Barbara Butch wore a silver headdress as drag artists and dancers surrounded her.  After watching the clip, some stars like Kansas City Chiefs player Harrison Butker and Caitlyn Jenner expressed disappointment at what they saw. Another vocal critic was Cameron Bure, 48.  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"To watch such an incredible event that's going to take place over the next two weeks and see the opening ceremonies complexly blasphemed and mock the Christian faith with their interpretation of the Last Supper was disgusting,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" the actress said via an Instagram video on Sunday, July 28. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"It made me so sad and someone said, 'You should not be sad. You should be mad about it.' I am like, 'Trust me, it makes me mad, but I am more sad because I am sad for souls.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  According to Olympic organizers, the scene did not have any ill intention. Instead, the moment depicted Dionysus, the Greek god of wine.  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Clearly there was never an intention to show disrespect to any religious group,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Paris 2024 spokesperson Anne Descamps said during an International Olympic Committee news conference on Sunday. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"We really did try to celebrate community tolerance. Looking at the result of the polls that we shared, we believe that this ambition was achieved. If people have taken any offense we are, of course, really, really sorry.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  Related: Stars React to Paris Olympics Opening Ceremony 'Last Supper' Controversy Jason Kempin/Getty Images; Gary Gershoff/Getty Images As Paris Olympic athletes continue competing for medals, event organizers find themselves defending portions of the Opening Ceremony.
