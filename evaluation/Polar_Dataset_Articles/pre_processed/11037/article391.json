"{\"uid\": \"article391\", \"text\": \"Sunday. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"On the contrary, I think we tried to celebrate community, tolerance. We believe this ambition was achieved.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" According to a post on X from the official Olympics account, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"The interpretation of the Greek God Dionysus makes us aware of the absurdity of violence between human beings.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  The performers involved in the controversial scene are not apologizing, however. Barbara Butch, a DJ and producer who has appeared on \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Drag Race\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in France and was featured at the center of the tableau wearing a halo-like headpiece, said in an Instagram post that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I have never been ashamed of who I am, and I take responsibility for everything - including my artistic choices.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" In a statement from her lawyer, Butch said she had been \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"threatened with death, torture and rape,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and been the target of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"anti-Semitic, homophobic, sexist and grossophobic insults,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and was filing complaints against her detractors.  Thomas Jolly, the artistic director of the opening ceremony, has denied that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"The Last Supper\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" inspired the tableau, or that he intended to belittle anyone's beliefs. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"The idea was to create a big pagan party \\\\\\\\u2026 you will never find in me, or in my work, any desire of mocking anyone,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" he said in an interview with the French broadcast network BFMTV.  Jolly did not elaborate about his inspiration, but some art experts see more similarities with paintings like \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"The Feast of the Gods,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" by Jan van Bijlert.  The conservative outrage also fails to make a distinction between a work of art painted more than 1,400 years after Jesus' crucifixion - one that is celebrated as much for its brilliant composition and use of perspective as for its religious message - and the New Testament accounts of the final meal Jesus shared with his apostles. And it conveniently overlooks that this mural was created by Da Vinci, a man who many scholars believe was in all likelihood gay or bisexual, and who is believed to have used his longtime lover as a model for his portrait of St. John the Baptist.  As the controversy over naked blue men and French pagans rages on, many of us in America can only wonder, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Hey, why did not we get to see the whole thing?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\"}"
