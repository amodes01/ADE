The American won three further medals in France to take her tally to 11, making her the most decorated gymnast in Olympic history.  Biles, who won gold in the team, all-around and vault events, has fought back from the disappointment of the Tokyo Olympics when she suffered from anxiety-induced 'twisties'.  The American pulled out four events after suffering from a mental block - known in gymnastics circles as the 'twisties'.  At 27, Biles will be 31 by the time the 2028 games is held in Los Angeles.

'Yesterday, when we got back to the village, I looked at Jordan [Chiles] and I started balling my eyes out,' Biles said on the Today show.  'She was like, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I knew it was going to happen, I just did not know when.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" I was just full of emotion and I finally released all of that.'  'I was so proud, happy, and bittersweet that the journey is over. It's so crazy, it happened so quick. My third Olympics.'  Asked about appearing in LA in 2028, Biles said: 'You know, you never say never. The next Olympics is on home turf so you just never know.  'I am just going to relax and see where life takes me.'
