News: Earlier this week, British scientists attempted to quash public panic about the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine following reports that two NHS staff suffered an 'anaphylactoid reaction' just after being immunised (Josie pictured in October)  Despite the two allergy cases the Government is continuing to vaccinate between 5,000 and 7,000 people per day across the UK with 800,000 Pfizer doses already in hospitals and millions more on the way.  Yesterday the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) - which authorised emergency use of the vaccine at a breathtaking speed - gave precautionary advice to all 50 NHS trusts now vaccinating the population.  They said that anyone who has a history of 'significant' allergic reactions to medicines or food should not receive the vaccine.  Elsewhere, pregnant women will not be offered Pfizer's breakthrough coronavirus vaccine due to a lack of evidence, experts have said.  And they will not be among the first to receive Oxford's or Moderna's either, if they are approved, because no mothers-to-be were included in clinical trials.

Women who think they might be pregnant are urged to delay vaccination until they are certain they are not, and those trying for a baby should not be immunised either.  However, the measure is purely precautionary and it is not uncommon to exclude some groups from taking brand new vaccines.  Pfizer's vaccine sailed through approval from Britain's medical watchdog last week with a good safety rating and no evidence to suggest pregnant women are at risk.  WHAT ARE THE KNOWN SIDE EFFECTS OF THE PFIZER VACCINE? The UK medicines regulator advised today that anyone who has a history of 'significant' allergic reactions to medicines, food or vaccines should not get the Pfizer coronavirus jab. Dr June Raine, the chief executive of the MHRA, told Parliament's Science and Technology Committee that this was not identified in the trials. 'We know from very extensive clinical trials that this wasn't a feature,' she said. Allergic reactions to the vaccine are 'very rare', according to the trials involving more than 40,000 people. Pfizer found a 'very small number' during its phase three clinical studies, which found 137 out of 19,000 people. This compared to a comparable 111 in a group of the same size who did not get the vaccine. They also identified 12 possible side-effects from the vaccine, with seven identified as 'very common' meaning they are likely to affect more than one in ten people. Below are the known side effects. The patient safety leaflet for the vaccine cautions that anyone with an allergy to any of the active substances in the vaccine should not receive the jab. It adds: 'Signs of an allergic reaction may include itchy skin rash, shortness of breath and swelling of the face or tongue.' Allergic reactions to the vaccine are: Very common (Likely to affect more than one in ten people) Pain at injection site  Tiredness  Muscle pain  Chills  Joint pain  Fever  Headache Common (Likely to affect up to one in ten people) Injection site swelling  Redness at injection site  Nausea Uncommon (May affect one in 100 people) Enlarged lymph nodes  Feeling unwell Advertisement  But scientists\"}"
