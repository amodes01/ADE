"{\"uid\": \"article214\", \"text\": \"Ryan Gosling and Eva Mendes have never been seen out with their kids.  Until now!  If there is something that Ryan treasures more than anything is his family, and with that, his privacy for his young daughters and beautiful wife.  That feels like a huge ask for a Hollywood couple, but Ryan and Eva have managed to keep their girls out of the spotlight.  Then again, they could not let them miss the chance to see history unfold at the Olympics.

On Sunday, Aug. 4, the pair were spotted attending the equestrian Grand Prix freestyle at the Chateau de Versailles. In tow were their two little girls, Esmeralda, 9, and Amada, 8.  The pair's daughters have never been seen in public with their parents, at least not in such a public forum.  Ryan and Eva are very private and protective when it comes to their daughters. For that reason, despite attending the event, photos of both of the girls were either cropped to remove their faces or else blurred to protect their identity.  For example, during the equestrian Grand Prix, neither girl can be spotted in photos with their parents. Glimpses of their hair or profiles can be spotted, but in most photos, they are absent entirely.  But then the family attend the women's artistic gymnastics uneven bar finals.

Though the young family missed out on seeing Simone Biles in action, Ryan and his girls caught Suni Lee win Bronze for USA during the uneven bars.  In the photos, Amada and Esmeralda can be seen climbing into the laps of their father to get a better look at the event. However, their faces were blurred out for their privacy.  Still, you can still see the girls' outfits. The younger sister wore a yellow floral ensemble while Esmeralda had on a white sweatshirt with an American flag and the Olympics logo.

I will talk about them of course, with limits, but I will not post pictures of our daily life,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Eva wrote on Instagram in 2020.  Eva and Ryan, who met on the set of The Place Beyond the Pines, have been very clear that their kids are not celebrities and as such, deserve the same privacy as every other kid.  Still, should the time come that the girls want to be in the spotlight, like Blue Ivy, Suri Cruise, or Shiloh Jolie, Eva admitted she would relent.  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Since my children are still so little and do not understand what posting their image really means, I do not have their consent. And I will not post their image until they are old enough to give me consent.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  But being a family is all the pair have wanted, since they played one on the big screen.  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I wasn't thinking about kids before I met her, but after I met Eva, I\"}"
