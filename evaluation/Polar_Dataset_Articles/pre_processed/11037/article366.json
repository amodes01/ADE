More info  Well that's it, the Olympic Games 2024 have come to an end. And they did so in style - but after watching the closing ceremony, lots of people on social media had one question: was Tom Cruise involved?  During one segment of the closing ceremony there was a mysterious, masked 'Golden Voyager' who came down from the ceiling of the Stade de France. Then, hundreds of white figures came together to help the golden figure create the Olympic rings.  Several people on social media have theorised that Mission: Impossible actor Cruise is the man behind the mask. Do you agree? Let us know in the comments.
