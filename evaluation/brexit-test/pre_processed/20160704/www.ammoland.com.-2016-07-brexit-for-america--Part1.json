The Magna Carta and Declaration of Independence were about overbearing, despotic kings. Brexit, Britain's decision to leave the European Union, was much about overbearing bureaucrats in Brussels.  This year's US elections likewise center on gaining a new measure of freedom from an authoritarian, unaccountable Executive Branch in Washington.  Like Brexit, they are also about We the People actually having a role in a democracy, a voice in how much power government will have over our lives.  The Brexit motto is fast becoming the driving force in 2016 politics: \\\"Take back control!\\\"  Today's ruling elites do not govern from positions of land ownership or birth, but from assertions of greater education, expertise and wisdom than supposedly possessed by citizens at large.  These ruling classes increasingly control our lands, the energy and minerals beneath them, and the lives, livelihoods and living standards of those beyond the DC Beltway. People are getting fed up.  A Financial Times headline just days after the Brexit vote read \\\"Clinton wary of populist contagion.\\\" She should be.  The very notion that people might vote to loosen the shackles of intrusive government is anathema to her. Like President Obama, Hillary Clinton shares the mindset that democracy is fine if angry liberals can be mobilized to elect an activist, wealth-redistributionist president to \\\"fundamentally transform\\\" America. It's unsettling and intolerable if conservatives mobilize to unelect this agenda.  Mrs. Clinton and her increasingly far-left party rightly worry that voters have had a bellyful of liberal-progressive policies that have rolled back economic growth, job creation, and incomes for poor, working class and minority families; unleashed waves of illegal immigration; and imposed massive cultural changes on our communities and military. And yet, right after the Brexit vote, Mrs. Clinton said:  \\\"Our first task has to be to make sure the economic uncertainty created by these events does not hurt working class families here in America.\\\" Talk about being insulated from reality.  Possible impacts from Britain's exit from the EU are hardly the issue. America's concern is the certain harm to working classes inflicted by Mr. Obama's policies - which Ms. Hillary promises to redouble if elected. Her comment to West Virginia's coal country electorate underscores her insensitive disdain.  \\\"I am going to put a lot of coal miners out of jobs,\\\" she informed them. And she will not stop there.  Germany, Britain and Poland are finally awakening to the ways exorbitant prices for subsidized, unreliable wind and solar electricity are hammering their poor and middle class families, destroying their international competitiveness, and driving their steel, auto, ceramics and other industries out of business.  But Mrs. Clinton has also vowed to regulate hydraulic fracturing into oblivion, and ban mining and drilling on federally controlled lands that represent 30-85% of all real estate in Alaska and America's western states. Her rabid environmentalist base wants to rid these areas of ranching and grazing, as well.  The economic impacts will roll through states and communities like successive tsunamis. Mrs. Clinton, her media and intellectual supporters, and ruling elites will likely respond as they always do.  \\\"What difference at this point does it\"}"
