In the meantime, the Alaskan Independence Party (AIP) has been calling to quit the US since 1980s. There is also the so-called Cascadian movement in the US and Canada, which calls to form a country consisting of Washington, Oregon and portions of other US states, as well as British Columbia, Canada.  Hawaii, the most recent state of the US, which received statehood back in 1959, has also had its own independence movements since the 1960s. One of them, the Hawaiian sovereignty movement, says that the archipelago's annexation was illegal.  However, according to Eugene Volokh, a law professor at University of California, the exit of states from the US, and Texit in particular, will not happen.  \\\"A state could not legally force the US to let it secede, if the US refused. But if the state and the US agreed, that would be doable. At worst, it would require a constitutional amendment, but most likely an act of Congress, coupled with a majority referendum that the state government views as binding, would suffice,\\\" Volokh told the Dallas Observer  He added that \\\"most Texans \\u2026.are proud to be Americans, whether or not they like what the federal government is doing, and they can see the benefits of remaining part of a powerful country that can defend their interests.\\\"\"}"
