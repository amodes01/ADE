We did not,\\\" the then-First Lady contemptuously responded to suggestions that she and President Clinton mishandled financial reports on their Whitewater land deals. She gave the same dismissive answer to \\\"impertinent\\\" questions about her improper State Department email server.  \\\"Every survivor of sexual assault deserves to be heard, believed, & supported,\\\" she tweeted in 2015. But if they are victims of her husband's sexual predations, she labels them \\\"trailer trash,\\\" like Gennifer Flowers, or slimes and pressures them to shut up, like Juanita Broaddrick and other women.  Like Mr. Obama and other elites, she surrounds herself with armed security details - and then demands more gun control when unarmed or disarmed Americans are murdered in Orlando, San Bernardino or Fort Hood \\u2026 while scrubbing press releases and cell phone transcripts of any mention of Islamist motives.  The Obama Justice Department prosecuted ex-Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell over a watch and meeting arrangements. (An 8-0 Supreme Court decision threw out the conviction.) But the DOJ was silent about Secretary of State Clinton appointing Rajiv Fernando to the International Security Advisory Board, giving him access to ultra-sensitive intelligence - when his only apparent \\\"qualification\\\" was raising millions of dollars for Mrs. Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign, donating hundreds of thousands to the Clinton Foundation, and giving tens of thousands to Hillary PACs.  The extensive quid-pro-quo of $200,000 Bill and Hill speeches and special deals for Wall Street, Saudi and other supplicants - swelling Clinton Foundation coffers - has received similar DOJ inattention.  Obama, Clinton and other Democrat kids go to pricey, private prep schools - while they oppose funding for charter schools that give poor and minority kids a chance to escape inner city life. They demand full integration of middle-income neighborhoods, but live in segregated, gated communities.  Those who dare question government diktats gets targeted or audited by the IRS, or even find armed SWAT teams bursting through their doors.  Legal immigrants face slow, expensive processing - while illegals from Latin America receive healthcare and education, live in sanctuary cities, and rarely get deported for crimes. 99% of Syrian refugees arriving under the latest Obama decree are Muslims, even as Christians are being exterminated in Syria and Iraq.  More and more, it seems, our government does whatever it decides the times demand - even when it means stifling innovation, growth, jobs and incomes for everyone except bureaucrats and crony corporatist friends, whose decisions, arrangements, perks and pensions are sacrosanct.  \\\"As president, I can do whatever I want,\\\" President Obama has said. If it was meant as a joke, few are laughing. On June 30, total government debt hit a record $19.4 trillion, a jump of nearly $98 billion from the day before. Our kids and their future generations will pay the price.  Elites impose healthcare, climate change, red-ink and transgender agendas - and then go apoplectic over Donald Trump's controversial remarks. There is a \\\"clear consensus\\\" among intellectual, political and media elites that Donald Trump is \\\"ill-suited to be president,\\\" we repeatedly hear.  By contrast, Mrs. Clinton offers the \\\"calm, steady, experienced leadership\\\" we need in these\"}"
