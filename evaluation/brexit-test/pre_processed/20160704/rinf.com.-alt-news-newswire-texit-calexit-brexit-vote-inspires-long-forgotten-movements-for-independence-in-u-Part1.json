But are they really ready to follow #Brexit and revive their bids to break away from Washington.  #Texit #Texodus  Right after the Brexit success, people in Texas began pushing for a 'Texit'- a Texas split from the USA - on social media.  To explain why Texas should secede from the Union, Twitter users showed the map of EU and outlined the area of the Lone Star State. And it looks rather impressive.  Others even suggested a better hashtag for a Texas exit: #Texodus, a portmanteau of 'Texas' plus 'exodus', the migration of Jews from Egypt.  Texas was the 28th state to join the Union in 1845, following nine years as an independent republic. According to speculation from the Texas Nationalist Movement, the state could exit the US as early as 2018.  \\\"In the Brexit vote, the people of UK felt that they were paying more into EU than were getting out of it. And it's exactly as it is here in Texas,\\\" Daniel Miller, President of the TNM, told RT.  According to Miller, there is a sense locally that the best people to govern Texas are Texans.

Maybe a Calexit might not be a bad idea. 6th largest economy in world & an engine for economic growth. California as a sovereign republic. - Shervin Pishevar (@shervin) June 24, 2016  The 'Yes, California' Twitter community, which leads the campaign for the Golden State to secede from the United States, already compared the size of California to the EU.  \\\"We are here in California subsidizing the other states of this union,\\\" Louis J. Marinelli, president of the Yes, California independence campaign, told RT. \\\"As a result we are losing tens, sometimes hundreds of billions of dollars every year\\\" to other states.  Thus, Californians do not have enough to improve healthcare or education, he added.  \\\"We did an informal poll. We asked 9,000 Californians: 'Should California become an independent country?' And our response at that time was 41 percent said 'Yes'. That's why we take so much encouragement after what happened in the Brexit vote,\\\" he added.
