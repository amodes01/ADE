Trump's argument that a new president must \\\"make America great again\\\" won him the Republican Party nomination. But Senator Bernie Sanders, Clinton's forceful and persistent rival for the Democratic Party nomination, has advanced many of the same arguments to younger leftist audiences. His anger is targeted at big banks and corporations rather than Chinese and Mexican trade negotiators, but the fears he arouses are similar.  Candidate Clinton has responded to these challenges by talking down trade and withdrawing support for the Transpacific Partnership, an enormous trade agreement that Barack Obama considers a crucial part of his legacy. But if President Hillary Clinton believes that, after defeating Trump and Sanders, she can easily revert back to pro-trade, pro-globalization policies, she will have misunderstood why voters have made her president.  And if she misses the message, her presidential \\\"honeymoon\\\" will not last long.  * Ian Bremmer is president of Eurasia Group and author of \\\"Superpower: Three Choices for America's Role in the World.\\\" Find him on Twitter @ianbremmer.\"}"
