The world we live in post 2008 financial meltdown and the US-inflicted mortgage crisis, from which no country ever recovered, has pushed nations to an inflection point and led to the closing down of their borders - a departure from the times that thrived on a free flow of ideas, finance, technology and travel.

Connect  Let us know for a fact that the big American Dream was killed by the nation itself in 2008, which had shattered the dreams of the rest of the world. And now, in the absence of recovery, central banks are contemplating resorting to printing more money; QE4, as economies get addicted to quantitative easing - following this, the depreciation of currencies and the decline of purchasing power will continue, as Marc Faber, investor and the futurist of gloom and doom, predicts.  The point here is that both the UK and the US are First World countries that were proponents of free trade across borders and who enjoyed decades of growth from it.  Donald Trump. (Reuters)  And the US now cries \\\"rape\\\" as Trump did on job losses, promising to re-negotiate previous trade pacts. \\\"They have taken our jobs, they have stolen our wealth...\\\" he said, speaking of immigrants. Peddling fear more than he sells hope, presumptive President Trump strikes a chord with 46 million Americans with incomes below the poverty line; his populist rancour appeals to 65 per cent of voters who want curbs on imported goods, because gains from economic recovery have been inequitous and accrued to only the wealthy.

Secondly, across Europe, the US or India, extreme nationalism and xenophobia is also fuelled as a consequence of productive immigrants perceived and braced with the same scepticism as Muslim refugees, who historically never integrated culturally with the country they domiciled in.  Scarcity  Islamaphobia has seen a 326 per cent rise in 2015, making it difficult at the point of entry to differentiate a \\\"good Muslim\\\", one who is liberal and productive, from one who has arrived in a new country to kill, spread venom and sabotage peace.  In a world of plenty, people are generous and do not mind sharing the boom times; but in a world of scarcity and shrinking resources, people and nations are inclined towards self-preservation in a fight-or-flight syndrome.

The poor and middle classes in most countries, First World or Emerging World economies, are responding to hyper nationalist demagogurey of leaders for closing down borders because the vox populi favours protectionism, having seen no major gains accrue to the \\\"one per cent over the 99 per cent\\\".
