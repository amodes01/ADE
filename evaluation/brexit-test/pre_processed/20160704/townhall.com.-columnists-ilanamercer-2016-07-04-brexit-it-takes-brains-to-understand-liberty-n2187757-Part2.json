Here the booing resumed.  If, in sensing an opportunity to exert unauthorized political power, this unelected mob intended to reject trade between Europe and England, reinstate tariffs and quotas-Mr. Farage was pleased to inform them the consequences to Europe would be worse.  No doubt: As statist and regulated as the once great merchant and maritime nation of Britain has become-Europe under the Brussels machinery is practically paralyzed.  Few in U.S. media appreciate that language that effectively conveys clear ideas has got to be strong. Weasel words will not do. Thus Ashley Banfield was flabbergasted by Farage's verbal whips. CNN's verbose host was appalled, you guessed, at the \\\"tone\\\" taken by Farage in his pointed remarks to the EU.  Days prior, two lunatic American women, dressed in matching Mao-like tunics, had stormed a stage together, where they had a petit mal fit over Donald Trump. Yet the two-Hillary Clinton and \\\"Pocahontas,\\\" aka Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts-made reporters like Banfield giddy with Girl Power.  Advertisement  Never was Warren depicted as angry or out-of-control. Instead, she was a \\\"towering\\\" liberal Democrat, who delivered not ad hominem but \\\"energy, folksy appeal and a populist roar ...\\\"  By contrast, Quest, Banfield's British-born colleague, was able to settle down to a blind panic by the time he conducted his exhilarating interview with Mr. Farage.  No longer in a post-Brexit frothy, Quest even accepted Farage's forceful instruction to \\\"stop this nonsense about the markets. The pound has been in a bear market since July 2014. Fact!\\\" Jittery markets had begun to self-correct, the Dow was bouncing back.  Unlike their hysterical colleagues in the US, British liberal journalists have even begun to pull back slightly in embarrassment. Were they really going to persist in lamenting losses suffered by global puppet-master George Soros and the financial sector, all just to take aim at the Little People? In so doing, was not the Left showing it loved the lumpenproletariat only as long as they got with The Left's program?  Moreover, Quest's professional counterparts in Britain (indubitably the smarter cohort) seem to have backed off of accusing 17.5 million \\\"Leave\\\" voters of being old, uneducated, racist, and generally obsolete right-wing extremists. In other words, Trump voters. The liberal brain trust stateside has yet to grant this courtesy to Tea Party pioneers, much less to Trump voters.

Farage did. He stumped Quest by explaining that markets are not the creatures of big business. \\\"Good markets have small and medium size competitors trading in them too.\\\" He then pivoted to the crony actions of the free-market flouting Goldman Sachs. \\\"In cahoots with this European commission,\\\" such bad-faith actors did much mischief: Usher \\\"Greece into the Euro,\\\" for example.  Ordinary people are slowly coming to realize that adding a second tier of tyrants-EU, NAFTA, UN, NATO, WTO-to their own tyrannical national governments has\"}"
