Those jobs result in $3.4 billion in wages.  Here, the U.K. stands out in the local economy. The biggest share of those jobs, one out of five, is in a business owned by a U.K. company or investor.  Timmermann, at UCSD, is not sure how the Brexit fallout might affect U.K. business ownership locally.  \\\"We just do not know how different the new world will look compared to the old world,\\\" he said. It's unlikely, however, that the relationship between them and the U.S. will change much.  Expect recession sooner  How exposed San Diego is to the U.K. economy will not matter if the whole U.S. economy goes belly up. Intensity Corp. is a San Diego-based company that uses big data to predict, among other things, changes in the overall U.S. economy.  Intensity CEO Ryan Sullivan said Brexit is having a profound effect.  \\\"The Brexit vote caused us to accelerate our expected start of the recession here in the United States by four months, from January 2018 to September 2017,\\\" he said. The odds of a recession in the next 12 months also increased to 43 percent from 27 percent, according to the company's forecast.  \\\"This ranks up there with being among the most dramatic effects that we have seen,\\\" Sullivan said.  One positive for San Diegans in the Brexit chaos: Aside from cheaper tourism in the U.K. itself, imports from Britain to the San Diego cost, at least for now, about 10 percent less.\"}"
