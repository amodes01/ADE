And yes there are genuine concerns for the European economy at large as a result of Britain leaving. These realities cannot be denied and that is why swift trade agreements are needed to be put in place to steady this ship and allow for some confidence to materialise.  Stock specific comment  Contrarian stockpickers will undoubtedly now be unsurprisingly weighing up the risk reward potential of the banking and property sectors in particular Simultaneously brokers and analysts will be pondering whether the 'dollar earners' are in profit taking territory. I have been reducing in this recently outperforming space.  Regarding oil majors, I note the oil price itself is still struggling to punch through the $50 per barrel level, yet the sector has significantly short term outperformed discounting of course the current FX situation. I am not convinced in the second half of this year that oil will progress definitively higher and thus see opportunities here to at least reduce overweight positions.  While both Shell (2010p) and BP (420p) will work hard to find ways to maintain their current dividend payout ratios, there is little doubt to me that the oil price will assist matters. Thus these companies will be forced to cut out more cost probably at the expense of future production cashflows. I am wary.  In a similar vein, I would be looking to reduce into current strength GSK (1540p) the pharmaceutical giant as the PE ratio (valuation) once again looks toppy to me at 17 times next year's profits. While I appreciate the cable (pound/dollar) exchange rate may remain favourable for the foreseeable future, the recent uplift is difficult to ignore. Certainly any reversal in current FX trends would see shares lower.  Housebuilding stocks have borne the brunt of the recent and current market weakness. The sector was already riding high on price to asset value metrics and Brexit has been the catalyst for a brutal correction.  Demand concerns weigh as does bank mortgage finance risk. The plus is that a weaker pound allows foreign buyers to get more bang for their buck which is a counterbalancer. Not for widow or orphans, dividend yields are likely maintainable. But this is a sector only for higher risk aware clients. The same goes for banks where the outlook has become unclear at least. It is fair to say a base rate rise is now unlikely any time soon.  Incredible times to be investing in markets and I have no doubt the next few months will bring further volatility and opportunity.\"}"
