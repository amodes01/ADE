Ronald Reagan once asked, \\\"If no one among us is capable of governing himself, then who among us has the capacity to govern someone else?\\\"  Indeed, who in government has the wisdom, knowledge or right to govern the rest of us, especially with the iron fist they increasingly employ - and with no transparency or accountability?  We gained independence from Britain over far less serious Abuses and Usurpations. Let us hope we can at least have an angry populace election in 2016. And if Mr. Trump can formulate, articulate and implement sound, practical, job-creating, economy-stimulating policies - and enough voters can unite around him and those policies - America might get its own Brexit from tyrannical centralized, leftist government.
