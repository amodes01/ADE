But shutting imports has a damaging and retaliatory effect from interdependent trading partners, as the entire chain of trade then halts because of locked-in economies.  How fair is a unilateral call for protectionism by the West, just as India is beginning to open up as also other emerging nations who are equally dependent on trade for recovery?  In that, Brexit is a historic and geopolitical event, no less significant in magnitude than 9/11 or 2008. It sets in motion a second round of disintegration of a comity of nations after World War II, the Soviet Union being the first.  In such a world of compounding scarcity and inequity, let me throw in an alarmist eventuality that is going to be the black swan of all events possibly a decade from now: robots replacing humans, a faceless enemy of all working classes.  What sounds sci-fi of today, as did water-scarcity and climate change years back when futurists predicted it, this disruption will sound the death-knell for labour, shaving off jobs.  The Bank of England believes machines might replace 80 million American and 15 million British jobs over the next 10-20 years, as CNN Money reports, or 50 per cent of the workforce in each of the two countries.  Luddites will then rise in a bigger revolt as a reaction to the fifth wave of change.\"}"
