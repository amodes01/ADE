Concocted in Paris last year by the UN and its member governments, the controversial deal is unprecedented in terms of its full-blown promotion of regional governments, such as the EU, as crucial players in imposing the international agenda. But with Brexit, that gamble has turned against the globalists, and now they are scrambling to save face amid a victorious \\\"leave\\\" campaign led largely by climate skeptics and realists.  Whether the Paris Agreement is doomed yet remains unclear. Either way, though, the UN \\\"climate\\\" agreement is on increasingly shaky ground. Among other headaches for UN climate alarmists and internationalists hoping to centralize power at the global level is the United States. GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump is already vowing to blow up the Paris deal and de-fund the UN bureaucracy responsible for it. Indeed, U.S. funding for the UN \\\"climate\\\" machine is now illegal under federal law. Plus, there is practically zero chance of ratification for the deal by the U.S. Senate, as required by the Constitution for all treaties.  {modulepos inner_text_ad}  Other governments are also weary of ratifying the controversial scheme for various reasons, even with promised bribes to Third World dictators who play along. And with the man-made global-warming theory looking increasingly discredited - just 40 percent of Americans believe the theory in polls, as observable evidence debunking it continues to grow - the clock is running out on the alarmists. Now, the British referendum to leave the EU represents the latest monkey wrench to be thrown into the gears of the UN's \\\"climate\\\" agenda. Establishment-controlled \\\"green\\\" groups and \\\"news\\\" outlets are already sounding the alarm, calling on Prime Minister David Cameron to ink the Paris Agreement prior to leaving office in case a \\\"skeptic\\\" government takes the reins.  Before the Brexit referendum last month on whether to secede from the increasingly totalitarian EU, UN climate czarina Christiana Figueres warned that the UN pseudo-treaty purporting to control \\\"global warming\\\" would have to be rewritten if the Brits voted to leave. Speaking at a June 22 press conference next to EU Energy Union Commissioner Maro\\u0161 \\u0160efcovic, a \\\"former\\\" communist from Slovakia, and billionaire U.S. extremist Michael Bloomberg, whose fanaticism on global warming is second only to his crusade to disarm Americans by any means necessary, Figueres was clear that if Brexit were to happen, the UN scheme could not just march on uninterrupted.  Basically, she said, if the British people reject the EU, the Paris deal would need to be renegotiated and rewritten. \\\"From the point of view of the Paris Agreement, the U.K. is part of the EU and has put in its effort as part of the EU so anything that would change that would require a recalibration,\\\" said the controversial UN figure, who famously opened one of the UN's infamous carbon dioxide-spewing \\\"climate\\\" conferences with a prayer to the Mayan goddess of war, human sacrifice, and cannibalism. \\\"In principle, it is actually, historically, we say, as humankind, we are moving towards larger and larger tents of collaboration [\\u2026] rather than in the opposite way.\\\"  The British voted to leave the EU anyway, sending prices for CO 2 -emissions permits in the super-state's so-called carbon market\"}"
