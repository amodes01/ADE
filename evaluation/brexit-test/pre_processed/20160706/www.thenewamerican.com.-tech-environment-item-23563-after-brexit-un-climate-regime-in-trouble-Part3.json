It is clear that these Soviet-style regimes are being positioned to play an increasingly massive role in the lives of people around the world, all under the supervision of the UN. In fact, even the preamble to the Paris Agreement vows to \\\"uphold and promote regional and international cooperation in order to mobilize stronger and more ambitious climate action.\\\"  The scheme also calls on parties to the UN scheme to \\\"strengthen regional cooperation on adaptation\\\" and \\\"establish regional centers.\\\" By \\\"regional cooperation,\\\" the document is of course referring to supranational governance at the regional level - the EU, the AU, ASEAN, and other such schemes. In all, there are 17 provisions relating to regionalism in the UN document, which is just over 30 pages long. With British voters dealing a crushing blow to regionalism by supporting Brexit, though, the agenda just suffered a major defeat.  Even domestically, the Brexit vote may have major implications on British \\\"climate\\\" policies. For one, many of the movement's leaders and its voters are deeply skeptical of the man-made global-warming theory, as well as the policies to allegedly deal with the alleged problem. \\\"It is highly unlikely that the party-political green consensus that has existed in parliament for the last 10 years will survive the seismic changes that are now unfolding after Britain's independence day,\\\" said Global Warming Policy Foundation director Benny Peiser, citing the \\\"astonishing self-determination and skepticism of the British people in [the] face of an unprecedented fear campaign.\\\"  The UN and Obama are pretending that if enough Third World dictators can be bribed (with your tax money) into \\\"ratifying\\\" the pseudo-treaty before a potential President Trump, that it will be more difficult for the deal to be shredded. That is, of course, nonsense, as the scheme was never ratified by the U.S. Senate or even presented to it for ratification, making it essentially a glorified press release by Obama and his cohorts, with accompanying illegal and unconstitutional decrees with no force of law. In short, the foundation of the entire scheme is built on quicksand, and it appears to be in the process of swallowing up the scam.  Regardless of what happens with Brexit, Americans must continue to expose the fraud that is the UN's Paris Agreement. With a concerted educational campaign, the extremist plot to empower the UN and regional governments over every aspect of life can and will be crushed.
