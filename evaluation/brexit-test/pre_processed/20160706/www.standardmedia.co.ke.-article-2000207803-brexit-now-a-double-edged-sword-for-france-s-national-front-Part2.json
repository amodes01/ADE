Le Pen has said that, if elected, she would launch negotiations to leave the euro, restore borders, ensure the primacy of French law over EU law, and scrap EU checks on French public finances.  After six months, voters would decide in a referendum whether to stay in the bloc or leave.  Even within the FN, there has been criticism of this policy, which has put off the elderly - who tend to vote more than younger voters - for fear their pension could be affected.  But opinion polls since the Brexit vote show a change among FN voters, with a huge majority now backing an EU exit.\"}"
