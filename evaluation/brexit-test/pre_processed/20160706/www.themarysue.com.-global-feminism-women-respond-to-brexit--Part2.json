"{\"uid\": \"www.themarysue.com.-global-feminism-women-respond-to-brexit--Part2\", \"text\": \"specifically to Walker's concerns about legislation for female workers that she cites as the result of the UK's partnership with the EU, the Women for Brexit camp seems to believe that everything is honky-dory with regard to Women's Rights, as they point out on the Women's Rights section of their website:  Britain has long been the champion of women's rights. Gained the vote in 1918  Equal Pay Act 1970  Sex Discrimination Act - 1975  Employment Protection Act - 1975  First Female Prime Minister - 1979  Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act - 2004 All of these pieces of law have helped advance women rights in the UK, however none of them are as a result of the EU. They are British-made laws and they will still be there after we leave the EU.  However, the site makes no mention of the laws that were a result of the EU. Things like protections that keep women from being fired for being pregnant, paid parental leave for all parents, equal pay for equal work as a \\\"fundamental right,\\\" and protections from discrimination \\\"on the grounds of religion, sexuality, gender reassignment status, belief, and age.\\\" Apparently, before the EU created rules around this, the UK only had laws for race and gender discrimination.  So sure, the UK is capable of learning how to act right, but the decision to leave the EU means that all the protections that were fought for so hard to improve the lives of women in the workplace are now up in the air, forcing women in the UK to now be dependent on the whims of their own lawmakers. Lawmakers who are now embroiled in a political clusterfudgcicle steeped in racism and sexism. (\\\"Clusterfudgcicle,\\\" Trademark pending)  In a piece over at Refinery 29, Dr Roberta Guerrina, Reader in Politics at Surrey University brought up the point that moves towards equality are always the most in danger at times of economic crisis, which is exactly what this move to leave the EU will be bringing to the UK. She says, \\\"Equality is something that governments promote in times of economic prosperity, but seems to be acceptable collateral damage at points of crises. Social justice, gender equality and equal pay have taken a significant set back due to austerity.\\\"  And lastly, British political writer, Laurie Penny, wrote about her fears for the most marginalized among the UK's citizens in a piece for Time Magazine called \\\"The British People Have Been Suckered,\\\" as she warns us in the U.S. about not letting the same mistake happen to us in our upcoming Presidential election. She says:  No, not everyone who voted \\\"leave\\\" is a swivel-eyed bigot. But the people who are largely voted that way, and the many gentler citizens who did the same now have to live with the fact that they have helped to empower the worst impulses of the angriest, most desperate people in this country at a time when racism is the only recognized outlet for working-class rage. As in America, the \\\"voice of the people\\\" is never paid any attention unless and until it is redirected into violent neo-nationalism, and that's an formula which overlooks a good many of the actual, living, human people struggling to survive under neoliberalism today. That includes young people, queer people, disabled people, migrants, people of color and a great many ordinary citizens who were not taken in by hollow promises that Brexit would lead to better public services and free cake for everyone.  Basically, this vote has ushered in a very uncertain time for women, and if history is anything to go by, the progress made toward gender equality is likely to regress a lot before\"}"
