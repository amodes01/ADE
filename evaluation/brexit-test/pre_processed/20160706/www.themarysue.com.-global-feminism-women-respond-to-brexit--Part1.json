TMS is a US-based website, but we think it's important to connect with women all over the globe to applaud successes, report injustices, and amplify the conversation around solutions to gender-based inequality. We have written about women in other countries before, but we'd now like to make it a more consistent priority. Because \\\"Until we are all free, we are none of us free.\\\" - Teresa  The United Kingdom: Women Respond to \\\"Brexit\\\"  The United Kingdom recently held a vote, the results of which will change not only the lives of those in the UK, but will also affect the rest of the world. The UK has voted, by a small majority, to leave the European Union, and while the process will take a couple of years, there are already fears about the social, political, and economic ramifications the decision will have worldwide, and for decades to come.  But how will the decision to \\\"brexit\\\" affect the lives of women specifically? That's an important question\\u2026but also a difficult one to answer, not only because the issues are complex, but because women have largely been left out of the conversation to begin with.  Right from the get-go, a female Labour MP, Jo Cox, was tragically killed by a man who screamed \\\"Britain first,\\\" apparently targeting her because of her liberal stance on immigration and her desire for the UK to remain a part of the EU.  Throughout the entire lead-up to the historic vote, the voices and concerns of women were either silenced or ignored entirely. In an article that gathered the opinions of average female citizens in Britain, The Guardian's Helen Lewis said that \\\"[I]f you were feeling waspish, you might conclude that women's major contribution to the EU debate so far has been to say that more women should contribute to the EU debate,\\\" highlighting the fact that most of the debate surrounding the decision was dominated by white men in grey suits. Or, \\\"self-important Eurosceptic male backbenchers huffing about sovereignty, migration or Project Fear.\\\"  Sophie Walker, current leader of the UK's Women's Equality Party, wrote a piece for The Telegraph about how women need to be a part of the post-Brexit conversation. She says that issues like childcare, closing the pay gap, and the UK ratifying the pan-European Istanbul Convention to end violence against women and girls have to be a part of the conversation moving forward, and expresses concern about legislation that came about because of the EU to improve the lives of women:  Every recession that this country has endured has prompted the same response from government: to slash spending on women's jobs - the public service workers - and throw panicky pots of money at big infrastructure developments, construction, building - jobs for the boys. Let us do it differently this time. I want a conversation that considers how we can grow this country using the talents of the whole population. What does a caring economy look like, for example? Alongside that conversation I want to be clear: there can be no reneging on the legislation prompted by membership of the EU that - while creaky in places - has done much to enhance the lives of women workers.  However, as we know, women are not a monolith, and the \\\"Leave\\\" side had female support. You can check out the Women for Brexit site to check out their rationale. However, related\"}"
