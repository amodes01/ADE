The emphasis is only pure conservatism - not Republicanism. True to its roots, conservatism asserts that we are not created equal but that a properly maintained hierarchical system will be benevolent to all, and advocates reversion to a previous way of life that was preferable to this one.  3) The arguments are tautological  According to both UKIP and Trump, all the intricacies of domestic and foreign policy will be worked out when we \\\"take back control\\\" or \\\"make America great again\\\" by tightening or eliminating immigration and securing borders. When America is great again, immigration and border control (and everything else) will fall into place.  This argument is what we call tautological, basically because it is using itself to prove itself. America will be great again when immigration is resolved. When immigration is resolved, America will be great again. In other words, the resolution of immigration is both the way to make America great and the way to measure that America is great.  The problem with tautological arguments is that they are not really arguments at all - they are simply a long way of taking you back to where you started. Just like Trump's claims and UKIP's promises that resolving the immigration issue will resolve the immigration issue, tautological arguments do not have logical steps to take you from point A to point B. Instead, you keep finding yourself back at point A.  Tautological arguments can be very compelling, especially when replete with thuses and therefores, and when those making them claim to understand our own difficulties and challenges. When our deepest fears are preyed upon, it is easy to believe the promises of people who act like they know what they are talking about, to let fear and hatred dictate behavior. These promises are the bread and butter of Farage and Trump.  Britain's lawmakers installed failsafes into the government apparatus, mechanisms that require parliamentary endorsement before a referendum can take effect. Some might say this is an opportunity for public officials to rescue voters from their own, possibly less informed and more capricious, opinions. When comparing the UK and the US, the question is: Will the American electorate be able to rescue itself?  Dr. Gina Yannitell Reinhardt recently joined the Department of Government at the University of Essex as a lecturer. She studies how citizens and policymakers make decisions under uncertainty, and how those decisions affect economic, social, and political development and subsequent policy outcomes.
