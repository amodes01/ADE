Arrangements in place for how the EU and the UK will interact with each other after the split would not be negotiated until after the UK becomes a third state. In this scenario it could take up to a decade to agree all of the terms.  In practice the EU would probably allow informal consultations to be conducted during the two-year period before Brexit to allow parallel negotiations to take place, thus speeding up the overall process to maybe seven or eight years. During the period following Brexit until the final trade agreements are in place, the trade tariffs between the EU and UK would revert to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) tariffs, which for wine imports is 32%. So the longer this negotiation goes on, the longer wine lovers will suffer inflated prices for EU wine.  This is made all the more daunting by the fact that as soon as the UK becomes a third state it will also have to renegotiate the terms of trade with all of the other WTO countries as no current agreement exists between them and the UK as a standalone state, only as an EU member state. Therefore, although the UK will be free from the constraints of the EU to trade with non-EU wine-producing countries such as South Africa, Australia and the US, it will have to negotiate the trade tariffs while divorcing the EU.  The return of duty-free?  Before 1999 we Brits enjoyed taking home duty-free fags and booze from our European holidays. Could the return of duty-free help offset the increased cost of wine following the Brexit? Probably not. As part of the EU, UK nationals can fill the boot full of wine in France and take it home without paying any UK duty. You have to buy the wine duty-paid in France of course, but the duty on wine in France is just 2.8 centimes per bottle, compared with \\u00a32.08 per bottle in the UK. So it's practically duty-free already.  If duty-free shopping is re-introduced there will be limits to how much you can import without being charged UK duty, so wine lovers are likely to be worse off overall and the booze cruise will be consigned to history.  Is Brexit an opportunity for English wine?  If the cost of EU wine in the UK is going to increase, an obvious solution for wine lovers is to turn to English wine as an alternative. This creates an obvious opportunity for the English and Welsh wine industry.  Julia Trustram Eve of English Wine Producers has said in response to the referendum result, 'we face a new chapter in our nation's history and undoubtedly with that will come changes and opportunities. The UK wine industry remains excited and optimistic about its future.' Richard Balfour-Lynn of Hush Heath was also positive about the prospect of Brits turning to English wine. 'Leaving the EU is a great opportunity for the English wine industry to reduce duty and encourage more home-grown sales.'  English wine producers are not limiting their market to the domestic sales. Tamara Roberts, CEO of Ridgeview, is still positive about the UK government negotiating a deal with the EU which will allow them to continue to grow international sales. 'While we felt our business was stronger in the EU, we will now work hard to continue our success with exports and building our brand in an increasingly competitive international market place. We have to hope that the government is capable of negotiating the best possible free-trade agreements.'  Richard Balfour-Lynn also highlighted the opportunities in non-EU markets. 'Much of our export is to the US and Japan rather than the EU, and so there is unlikely to be a huge impact when it comes to the export of our premium\"}"
