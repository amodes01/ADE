As the pound topples, banks falter, and the United Kingdom's future blows in the wind, at least the course of true love can still run smooth after the EU referendum - thanks to a soon-to-be-launched dating app named Remainder that promises to connect \\\"the forgotten, Remain-voting 48 percent.\\\" Because what could be worse than finding Mr. Right, only to discover that he could be Mr. Far Right?  Depressed about #EUref? Heal the pain by dating Remain https://t.co/P7bFneL3JK - RemainderApp (@remainderapp) June 27, 2016  Billed as \\\"the dating app for the people who voted to save Britain,\\\" the Remainder app will not be officially rolled out until Saturday - just one week after the U.K. voted to withdraw from the European Union - but a website set up for the app has already attracted thousands of lovelorn \\\"Remainders.\\\"'  Read More: Could Brexit Be Canceled? Here's How Vote Might Be Reversed  The site's co-founders, a pair of likely lads from London who wish to remain anonymous, created the site \\\"as a joke\\\" the day after the referendum. But even in its nascent form, Andy (a second-year student) and Tim (a software developer), were \\\"amazed by the reaction\\\" - and realized they'd be numpties not to take it further.  \\\"The British motto is to keep calm and carry on,\\\" said Andy, in an interview with NBC News. \\\"There has not been much of that in the last few days, but maybe everyone just needs a good shag.\\\"  \\\"We thought maybe we could cheer everyone up if they got out of the house for dinner and a bottle of wine with another Remain voter,\\\" he said.  The Remainder team paired with a dating app provider and has been finalizing the site design in preparation for its launch this week. They also set up a crowdfunding page to cover web hosting expenses and further testing. \\\"Everyone's waiting for the app to land,\\\" Andy told NBC News.  As for its appeal: \\\"We have hit on the perfect indicator of kindness, intelligence, and good looks: People who voted Remain in the EU referendum,\\\" the site boasts.  The cheeky co-founders say they have a target of 16,141,241 sign ups - the exact number of people who voted to Remain.  And, if misery loves company, even Americans - excluded from Europe's biggest going away party - can fine-tune their search for love across the pond: \\\"Want to date or meet Brits, but worried they voted Leave? Meet someone who welcomes foreigners to Britain,\\\" touts the site.  \\\"Our advice for Americans wanting to date Brits is to make the first move,\\\" said Andy. \\\"We Brits get quite embarrassed about asking someone out for a date.\\\"\"}"
