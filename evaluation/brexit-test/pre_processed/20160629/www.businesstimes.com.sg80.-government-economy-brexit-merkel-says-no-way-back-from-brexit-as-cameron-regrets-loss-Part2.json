Ms Sturgeon said on Saturday that her government had started on legislation for a new referendum on Scottish independence - a vote that would risk a break up of the UK.  Mr Cameron has said a decision to start the EU withdrawal process is for his successor to make, yet his counterparts have no other interlocutor as long as there is no successor in place. The Conservatives aim to elect a new party leader by early September.  Mr Juncker said the EU would put a time limit on the UK's triggering of the exit mechanism - even though legally there is no obligation on Britain to do it at all.  \\\"If someone from the Remain camp will become British prime minister, this has to be done in two weeks after his appointment,\\\" Mr Juncker told reporters as the meeting ended. \\\"If the next British PM is coming from the Leave campaign, it should be done the day after his appointment.\\\"  EU President Donald Tusk, who co-ordinates summits, said the 27 leaders minus Cameron would meanwhile meet Wednesday to undertake \\\"deeper reflection\\\" on a \\\"new impulse for Europe.\\\" He said he plans to call another meeting of the 27 in September.
