The prime minister repeated the message he'd given back home: despite the uncertainty it's causing, that will be the job for his successor.  During a debrief over dinner, Mr Cameron told his 27 counterparts that their refusal to give him a deal that reduced immigration to the UK had cost him the referendum and his job, according to a British government official. He warned them that if they want a close economic relationship with the UK in the future, they will have to shift ground and find a way to tackle immigration, the official said.  'SORRY'  Mr Cameron was visibly shaken after the dinner, at which he said fellow leaders had told him how much Britain's membership of the EU meant to their countries. Asked he if regretted holding the referendum, he said he was \\\"sorry\\\" he'd lost, but that the pressure to hold it had been too great.  \\\"I fought very hard for what I believed in,\\\" Mr Cameron told reporters. \\\"I did not stand back. I threw myself in, head, heart and soul, to keep Britain in the European Union and I did not succeed.\\\"  As well as dashing lingering hopes among some in the UK that the referendum result can be somehow overturned, leaders rebutted claims from pro-Brexit campaigners about the nation's future relationship with the bloc. Several government chiefs insisted the UK cannot expect generous treatment from the EU once it's no longer a member.  FRENCH ELECTION  \\\"The UK will not be able to access the single market without applying the rules of freedom of movement,\\\" French President Francois Hollande said. \\\"This is not to punish the British people,\\\" but following the referendum \\\"they will have to face the consequences for some time.\\\"  With Mr Cameron the most high-ranking of a raft of political victims of the referendum in Britain, Mr Hollande signaled that the pros and cons of EU membership are also likely to influence the outcome of the French presidential elections next year.  Leaders expressed a growing frustration across Europe that the June 23 referendum has left a power vacuum in the UK and the whole EU in a state of limbo. European Central Bank President Mario Draghi told the closed-door session that growth in the euro area could decline by as much as 0.5 percentage point for the next three years cumulatively, according to a European official with knowledge of the meeting.  DOMESTIC TURMOIL  While in Brussels, Mr Cameron left behind a deepening political crisis at home with candidates from both his Conservatives and the Labour opposition challenging for the leadership of their respective parties, exacerbating the sense of a country adrift.  Attention among the Tories turned to which candidate might be the one to stop Boris Johnson from taking over in Downing Street, while Labour's Jeremy Corbyn lost a confidence vote but pledged to carry on as leader anyway.
