Lacy  Director, Robert J. Dole Institute of Politics  University of Kansas  \\\"This is shaping up as the most unique presidential election of my lifetime. I have seen them as a high-level advisor and as an observer, and this one is crazy and completely unpredictable.\\\"  Lacy has been director of the Dole Institute for Politics since 2004 and has played a major role in seven presidential campaigns, including senior roles in Bob Dole's 1988 and 1996 campaigns, Ronald Reagan's 1980 and 1984 bids, and George H.W. Bush's 1988 and 1992 campaigns. He was also President Reagan's White House political director. In 2007m he took a leave of absence from the Institute to manage the presidential campaign of former Sen. Fred Thompson (R-Tenn). During his tenure as director, Lacy has established the Dole Institute as a highly respected venue for bipartisan, philosophically balanced political programming. He can discuss the upcoming conventions, the nomination process, the possibility of brokered conventions, the importance of the conventions and the general election following both parties' conventions.  Contact: Mike Krings, [email protected]  Robert Boatright  Professor, Political Science  Clark University (Massachusetts)  \\\"Regarding the conventions, I will be looking at whether Republican elites -- donors, leaders of Super PACs, etc. -- find a compelling reason to stick with Trump. My expectation is that if Trump is still down in the polls once the conventions have concluded, most in the party will cut him loose and focus on minimizing party losses in the House and Senate.
