This year could be different, particularly on the Republican side. There is a significant chance we will see some delegates rebel against the party's presumptive nominee and attempt to choose someone else. We could see some real drama on the floor in Cleveland.\\\"  Masket is the author of \\\"The Inevitable Party: Why Attempts to Kill the Party System Fail and How They Weaken Democracy\\\" (Oxford University Press, 2016). A frequent writer and commentator, he can talk about American politics, political parties, campaigns and elections, polarization, social networks and political reform movements.

What's motivating partisans to vote in this climate? For too many of them, it's not high-minded, good-government, issue-based goals. It's, 'I hate the other party. I am going to go out, and we are going to beat them.' That's troubling.\\\"  Miller monitors national polling related to the presidential campaign that is made available and tweets analysis at Twitter.com/pmiller1693. His broad research interests include national politics and attitudes of partisanship. He is available to discuss political conventions, political partisanship, polling and elections.

Haselswerdt, Ph.D.  Professor of Political Science  Canisius College  \\\"Those in the national parties usually want their presidential candidates to win, but knowing that a sitting president defines the party, this may not be as true for significant portions of both parties this year.\\\"  Dr. Haselswerdt has more than four decades of experience in political science. He teaches courses in American political behavior, the U.S. Congress and research methods. He has been involved in several local political campaigns and is frequently asked by the media to comment on local, state and national issues. Dr. Haselswerdt teaches a popular course on Presidential Campaign Advance every four years and, as a result, several former students have worked on presidential campaigns. He served on the campaign staff for Michael Dukakis staff at the 1988 convention in Atlanta. He can speak to the different interests of the candidates and the national party at these gatherings, as well as to interests that are congruent. He would also be able to discuss the history of conventions and the chances of a contested convention.

But it will still be important, because now conventions mostly\"}"
