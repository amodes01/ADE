The entirely mindboggling argument is that Britain currently imports much of its food from the European Union. This is true of course. The brain warping part that follows is that because Britain leaves the European Union it will no longer be able to import food from the European Union.  What?  I am sorry but what? The detritus from what bong habit caused this mental spasm? What appalling misunderstanding of trade has led to the thought (thought? Pah!) that because we might not want to share a government with them any more, them across the Channel, they will therefore refuse to sell us stuff? Which -ish has caused this gibber?  Of course, there are corners of the internet where they will believe anything at all, even that The Donald and Hillary are the two best possible candidates out of 320 million people. But this food and Brexit idea has turned up somewhere generally thought to be respectable - the New Yorker no less. Perhaps if they spent a little less time thinking about the placement of commas and a little more about basic logic things would improve. But here it is:  In April, Lang co-authored-with Victoria Schoen-a \\\"briefing paper\\\" on the far-reaching impact of Brexit on British food. It is a sobering read. Lang and Schoen point out that, as of 2015, twenty-seven per cent of all food eaten in the U.K. (by value) was imported from the E.U. (compared with just four per cent from North America and four per cent from Africa). When it comes to fruits and vegetables, Britain is dependent on the E.U. for forty per cent of fresh produce. Lang sees this as a question of health as much as economics. Only thirty per cent of British adults currently eat the recommended five daily portions of fruits and vegetables, and only a tiny fraction of U.K. farmland is given over to horticulture-a hundred and sixty-four thousand hectares, out of 4.7 million hectares of crop-growing land. When the E.U. subsidies and tariff exemptions are gone, the odds are that plant foods will become more expensive, and that even fewer Brits will consume enough of them.  That paper is here:  The UK is heavily dependent on other EU member states for food. UK food production is below 60% of  consumption and particularly reliant on imports for fruit and many vegetables. Supporters of Brexit  have not once addressed the UK's dependency on EU producers and suppliers. The UK suffers a huge food trade gap of \\u00a321bn. Not only is the UK reliant on the rest of Europe for  food but this imbalance is a drain on the national balance of payments.  Yes, we buy lots of food from Europe. Doing so is a drain on the balance of payments (actually, no it is not, as the balance always balances it's an increase in the trade deficit though) and so dang what? Absolutely none of that dependency upon other EU nations is of Britons being reliant upon the kindness of foreign governments to be able to eat. It's reliant upon people being willing to sell us, for a profit, what we'd like to eat. In this Britain and Britons are in the same position as the 95% of the people in any advanced society who do something other than farm for a living. And who on Earth thinks that in or out of the EU Joachim, Jacques, Joao or Jorgen are going to be unwilling to send us some calories for a bit of folding stuff? It's a monstrously absurd assumption.
