So, Bernstein argued, stacking the pricing in China up against the entire group of more than 100 ships is not quite fair - even though the cruise company has made that exact comparison in the past.  Despite the lower pricing, Donald said he remained confident in the long-term prospects for the market.  \\\"Overall, China remains a robust opportunity and we are still at the very, very beginning of it,\\\" Donald said.  In a note to investors titled \\\"The China Concern,\\\" UBS Investment Research analyst Robin Farley wrote that China operations still add value to the company's earnings and pricing is higher than the average for the individual brands that are there.  \\\"The concern among investors is that as more supply is added to China, pricing could decline to the point where it is not accretive on all these levels,\\\" she wrote. \\\"So despite the raise in '16 yield guidance, the China controversy will continue in '17.\\\"\"}"
