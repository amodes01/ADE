It is a very generalised kind of racism oriented against any groups perceived not to be in that narrow category of white English identity.\\\"  The hate crimes recently reported to Operation Black Vote seem to confirm this. \\\"Two Muslim women in Bethnal Green, east London, had eggs thrown at them on the street,\\\" says Woolley. \\\"A black woman on a bus had a bunch of bananas placed on the chair next to her and was told to 'fuck off back to your country'. It is not just women. An Italian man was punched to the ground for asking another man which way he voted in the referendum.\\\"  Nor are attacks confined to areas that voted strongly to leave. A British Asian doctor in Urmston, Greater Manchester, tells me she was told to \\\"go back to your own country\\\" in a petrol forecourt at the weekend by a woman annoyed she had not driven away from the pump quickly enough. \\\"You just do not expect this in Manchester. I have never had that before,\\\" she says.  In Edinburgh, Lauren Stonebanks, 36, was on a bus on Monday when she says a woman shouted: \\\"'Get your passport, you are fucking going home.'\\\" She believes she was targeted because she is mixed race. \\\"As I got off the bus, the woman started making threatening gestures, like punching gestures. It made me feel absolutely terrified.\\\"  In Cobham, Surrey, British-born Saima, 46, was shopping for her elderly mother when she, too, experienced her first brush with racism. \\\"There was a man in his mid to late 30s ranting in the street about 'making Britain great again'. I looked over and he pointed at me, saying: 'People like you will be out of here soon.' It reminds me of the 70s with the National Front, when I remember being scared for my family. I feel as if we have gone back in time.\\\"  View image in fullscreen Neo-Nazi stickers in Glasgow. Photograph: Eoin Palmer  Woolley is clear, as is Tell Mama, that hate crimes have never gone away. Tell Mama's annual report, released on Wednesday, states that anti-Muslim hatred reported to them rose by a staggering 326% in 2015. Women, especially those who wear hijabs or niqabs, bear the brunt of this. Hope Not Hate points out that it has been arguing for some time that far-right extremism is not getting the attention it deserves. Yet the Brexit-inspired racism seems slightly different in that slurs are focused on ethnicity over religion. A report to Tell Mama included an incident of a man shouting: \\\"Brexit, you Paki\\\" at a taxi driver, before assaulting him.  Writer Nikesh Shukla was in Bristol on Tuesday when he witnessed an argument between a white man and a black man. As they separated, the white man shouted: \\\"Well, it's not your fucking country, is it?\\\" On Friday, a tweet about the far right in the US resulted in him being told to \\\"go back to brownland\\\". \\\"The tool of the racist, more recently, has been to make you feel you have a chip on your shoulder. Now it is barefaced: 'Go back to your country.'\\\"  BBC journalist Sima Kotecha interviewed a leave voter in her home town of Basingstoke who used the word \\\"Paki\\\". Afterwards, she tweeted: \\\"Have not heard that word here since the 80s!\\\" For many British Asians, it is a reminder of a darker period in British history. Anna Rahman, a psychiatrist, posted on Facebook: \\\"The first time I heard the word 'Paki', I was five and people were pelting eggs and stones at our windows. My father told me no one had the right to make me feel I did not belong here, telling me: 'You are as British as the Queen.' It makes me want to sob that, in this climate, I\"}"
