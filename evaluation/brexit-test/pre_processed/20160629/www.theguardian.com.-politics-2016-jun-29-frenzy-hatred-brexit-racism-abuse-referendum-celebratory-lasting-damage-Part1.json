Lakshmi D'Souza felt the early fallout from the bitter battle over the EU referendum while pushing a pram through east London early on Thursday morning. D'Souza passed a woman who warned her to \\\"be careful\\\". A man in the street was shouting racist abuse at a shopkeeper and passersby. As D'Souza walked past with her baby son, he looked at her and spat on the floor. D'Souza says that she fears the referendum has unleashed \\\"a frenzy of hatred\\\".  \\\"It takes a lot more than some idiot to bother me,\\\" she says. \\\"But the implication that this sort of behaviour will get worse because of a political decision \\u2026 just blows my mind.\\\"  True Vision, a police-funded hate-crime-reporting website, has seen a 57% increase in reporting between Thursday and Sunday, compared with the same period last month. This is not a definitive national figure - reports are also made directly to police stations and community groups - but Stop Hate UK, a reporting charity, has also seen an increase, while Tell Mama, an organisation tackling Islamophobia, which usually deals with 40-45 reports a month, received 33 within 48-72 hours.  In Great Yarmouth, Colin Goffin, who is vice-principal of an educational trust, was told about taunts and jeers being directed at eastern European workers by 10am on Friday morning - just hours after the results of the referendum had been announced. Goffin went to see a Kosovan-born friend, the manager of a car wash, to discuss the vote. In the Norfolk coastal town, 72% had voted to leave.  \\\"I wanted him to know that I did not agree with the decision, or the way that the issue of immigration had been used in the campaign,\\\" Goffin says. But when he arrived, the abuse against the multinational staff had already begun. \\\"He told me people were slowing down to laugh at his staff, wave and mouth 'goodbye',\\\" Goffin says. \\\"They had clearly not wasted any time in deciding to be hateful.\\\"  Unsurprisingly, European staff members were worried by the vote. \\\"What was most shocking was that these guys are well liked and go out of their way to help people - up until then, they would have felt part of our community. Suddenly, people felt it was OK to suggest they should clear off 'home'. I am angry and embarrassed by the way people from my home town acted.\\\"  View image in fullscreen Racist graffiti in Newington Green, London. Photograph: Emma Reynolds  Architect Toni (a Spanish citizen living in Brighton) had barely touched down in the UK after a weekend in Alicante when he came across a group of men causing a disturbance at passport control. \\\"There were four of them,\\\" he said. \\\"One of them shouted: 'Why are these bloody immigrants in the same queue as we are?' His friends were laughing. They were saying it loudly so people would hear. It was very uncomfortable. I have been here four years and I have never experienced anything like this.\\\"  Although another British passenger challenged the men, Toni said he was shaken by the incident. \\\"I am questioning whether I should stay - will I be a second-class citizen now?\\\"  Reports of xenophobia and racism have piled up in the media: the firebombing of a halal butchers in Walsall, graffiti on a Polish community centre in London and laminated cards reading: \\\"No more Polish vermin\\\" apparently posted through letterboxes in Huntingdon. Asked about the rise in hate crimes during PMQs on Wednesday, David Cameron said the government would be publishing a hate-crime\"}"
