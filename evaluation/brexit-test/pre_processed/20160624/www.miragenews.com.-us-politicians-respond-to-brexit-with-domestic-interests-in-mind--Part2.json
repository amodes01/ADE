Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas), who had previously warned President Obama against punishing the UK for leaving the EU, made a statement on Friday morning saying that he respects the decision of the British people to exercise their \\\"their sovereign right of self-government\\\" and leave the bloc.  \\\"Now is the time to preserve and strengthen our special relationship with the United Kingdom, which remains our closest NATO ally and a key member of the Five Eyes intelligence alliance,\\\" Cotton said, adding that the US should now begin new trade negotiations with the UK.  \\\"Meanwhile, the result of this referendum should remind leaders in Washington, London, Brussels, and across Europe that our citizens are dissatisfied with stagnant economies, declining wages, uncontrolled migration, rising crime, and terror attacks at home. It's time to abandon the failed policies of the past and solve the real problems of the present,\\\" Cotton said. (RT)\"}"
