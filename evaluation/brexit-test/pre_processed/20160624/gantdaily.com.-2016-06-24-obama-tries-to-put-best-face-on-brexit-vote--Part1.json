That will endure,\\\" said Obama, who in April visited London to urge the country to stay a European member state.  The President spoke with British Prime Minister David Cameron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Friday, saying afterwards that the EU will remain a \\\"vital\\\" U.S. partner, alongside NATO.  \\\"Our shared values including our commitment to democracy and pluralism \\u2026 will continue to unite all of us,\\\" Obama said, repeating a common theme in his addresses as criticism of immigrants and religious minorities has featured in the presidential campaign.  Other top U.S. leaders across the political spectrum also stressed continuity in America's relationship with the UK, even as the result roiled global economic markets, surprised friends and allies, and raised questions about the political future of both Europe and London.

These leaders were trying in part to calm tumbling global markets as stocks reeled in the vote's aftermath.  U.S. stocks plummeted almost 500 points Friday morning for their biggest drop in 10 months, a concrete reflection of how politics on one side of the Atlantic can profoundly affect the other.  Hillary Clinton, the Democratic party's presumptive presidential nominee, focused on the potential economic ripple effects and stressed the need to reaffirm the U.S. commitment to the special relationship it has with both the UK and the EU.  \\\"Our first task has to be to make sure that the economic uncertainty created by these events does not hurt working families here in America,\\\" Clinton said in a statement that drew an indirect comparison to Trump, her likely Republican rival.  \\\"This time of uncertainty only underscores the need for calm, steady, experienced leadership in the White House to protect Americans' pocketbooks and livelihoods, to support our friends and allies, to stand up to our\"}"
