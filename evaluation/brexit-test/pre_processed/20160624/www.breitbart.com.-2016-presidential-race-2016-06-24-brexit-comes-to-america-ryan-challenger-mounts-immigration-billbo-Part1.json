On Friday morning, Nehlen's campaign went live with a new billboard in Ryan's hometown of Janesville, Wisconsin that is reminiscent of the distinctive UKIP-style campaign.  The ad reads: \\\"Radical Islam Kills Americans. Vote YES for Immigration Control. Vote NO for Paul Ryan.\\\"  The billboard then directs viewers to Nehlen's campaign website, ElectNehlen.com.  UKIP's national billboard campaign is distinctive for its clear, straight-forward manner of describing the effects of large-scale migration and its impact on workers and Western culture.  \\\"This is the first of many billboards our campaign will be launching to inform the voters about what's at stake on August 9th,\\\" Nehlen told Breitbart.  As Nehlen's billboard suggests, Paul Ryan has a two-decade long history of pushing for open border immigration policies - including his 2015 effort to fund President Obama's expansion to the U.S. refugee resettlement operation.  In speeches, Ryan has made the case for policies that would effectively dissolve U.S. borders - declaring that the U.S. \\\"is more than [its] borders.\\\" Ryan has even articulated his support for implementing an immigration system similar to the open borders policy of the European Union - calling for \\\"an economic-based immigration system where\\u2026 labor and supply can meet each other so we can help fuel our economy and create jobs.\\\"  The phrase \\\"labor supply and demand can meet each other,\\\" is a centerpiece of open borders thought. Under this global, one-world theory, any willing employer should be able to hire any willing worker regardless of what country he or she lives in. This view, that America is an \\\"idea\\\" and not a \\\"nation,\\\" sees borders as an obstacle to commerce.  With regards to Islamic migration, Ryan's controversial omnibus spending bill funded U.S. visas for nearly 300,000 (permanent and temporary) Muslim migrants in a single year.  While polling data shows that the Republican electorate overwhelmingly backs proposals to temporarily pause Muslim migration, Ryan has rejected such proposals.  He has repeatedly ruled out the possibility of making any cuts to Muslim migration- insisting that \\\"that's not who we are,\\\" and that such a proposal is \\\"not reflective of our principles.\\\"  However, Ryan has not explained how importing hundreds of thousands of migrants from nations that hold sentiments that are anti-women, anti-gay, anti-religious tolerance, and anti-America benefits the United States or helps to protect our Western values.  Indeed, as a result of large-scale Muslim migration, the U.S. has imported several practices and values that are antithetical to Western principles.  For instance, Muslim migration has put half a million U.S. girls and women at risk of suffering the barbaric and misogynistic practice of Female Genital Mutilation, according to Equality Now.  Aayan Hirsi Ali has also observed that Islamic \\\"honor violence\\\" has become increasingly prevalent in the United States as a result of \\\"a significant increase in the number of people moving to the United States from countries with high-honor violence rates -notably Somalia\\u2026 as well as Iraq.\\\"  A 2011 study by the Tahirih Justice Center titled, \\\"Forced Marriage in Immigrant Communities in the United States\\\" found that in the U.S. there are \\\"as many\"}"
