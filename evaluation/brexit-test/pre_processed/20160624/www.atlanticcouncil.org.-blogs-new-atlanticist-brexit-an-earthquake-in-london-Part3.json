Westmacott said the United Kingdom's commitment to NATO to spend two percent of its GDP on defense, its commitment to nuclear deterrence, and the close cooperation between US and British agencies and armed services will be unaffected by a Brexit.  The road ahead  One of the biggest challenges that lie ahead will be how to manage the political and economic uncertainty as the United Kingdom sails into uncharted waters.  While there will be no immediate change in the United Kingdom's relationships, there will be a drop off in investments in the country and businesses will move out to ensure that they can be part of the single market, said Morningstar.  With regard to the negotiations with Brussels, Morningstar wondered how the EU would react. \\\"How accommodating will the EU be to Britain?\\\" he said. \\\"If Britain has problems and [a Brexit] is shown to have been mistake that could help mitigate the domino effect with respect to other countries.\\\"  Ashish Kumar Sen is deputy director, editorial, at the Atlantic Council.
