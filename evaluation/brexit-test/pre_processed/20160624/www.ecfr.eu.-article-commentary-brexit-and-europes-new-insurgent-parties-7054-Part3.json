US strategy in the Middle East was the most popular answer, with the violence sponsored by President Bashar al-Assad's regime in Syria in second place.  There is widespread scepticism around European or US interventionism generally, particularly in the Middle East. This sentiment was expressed by parties ranging from Ireland's Sinn F\\u00e9in, Britain's UKIP, France's Front National and Communist Party, Germany's AfD and Die Linke, Hungary's Jobbik, and Italy's Five Star Movement. On the prospect of collective European intervention in Syria, 32 parties responded that this should not even be on the table.  This position is linked to a general anti-Americanism and a distaste for the EU toeing the US line, particularly on Middle East policy. As the Front National told our researcher: \\\"The roots of all the main conflicts in Europe and its neighbourhoods can be tracked back to the actions of Washington as a hegemonic power.\\\" For many insurgent parties, this spurning of transatlanticism is also linked to strong suspicions about the impact of TTIP, with 27 of the parties interviewed answering that the EU should not make this deal with the US. But there were some notable exceptions among the parties that we interviewed - including the Sweden Democrats, the Danish People's Party, the Finns Party, the Estonian Party of People's Unity, Germany's ALFA, Syriza, and the Independent Greeks - who thought the deal could have a positive impact under the right conditions.  In terms of policy towards Europe's neighbourhood, there is a general consensus among the insurgent parties that more enlargement would be a bad thing - that the EU is big enough and, if anything, should be gradually dissolved. However, there is slightly more openness to the inclusion of countries to the east (notably Ukraine) than to the south (notably Turkey, with major fears expressed about the possibility of Turkish accession). Still, only 10 parties responded unequivocally that they supported Ukraine's path to EU accession and, of these, two would not support NATO accession for Ukraine (UKIP's position was the reverse, supporting Ukraine joining NATO but not the EU).  Perhaps the most significant issue that divides the challenger parties is how to engage with Russia. There is general sympathy for Russian foreign policy (30 parties expressed support for at least some recent Russian positions, particularly its intervention in Syria, in the absence of other actors taking a decisive position on the conflict), and a sense that the EU's policy on its neighbourhood should not be pitted against that of Russia. However, when it comes to specific policies such as EU sanctions against Russia, views were much more mixed. Twenty-four parties argued that the sanctions should not stay in place beyond July, with parties as diverse as the French Communist Party, Cyprus's AKEL, Dawn and other Czech parties, and Syriza and the Independent Greeks viewing them as an obstacle to dialogue with Russia, and damaging to EU economies.  These views on Russia policy do not fall naturally along the lines of left and right, but tend more towards national perspectives - for example, in Germany, both Die Linke and AfD believe that the sanctions on Russia should be lifted, while in Greece, Syriza and Golden Dawn agree on this. On the question of Ukraine's accession, however, more of a left-right split is evident, with parties on the left generally more supportive of Ukraine's path to EU membership.  How are the insurgent parties influencing foreign policy?  With the exception of Malta's\"}"
