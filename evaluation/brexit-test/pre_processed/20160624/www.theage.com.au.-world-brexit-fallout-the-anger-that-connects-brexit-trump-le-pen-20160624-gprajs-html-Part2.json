The changes under way could also produce new or restructured arrangements for international management, rather than the Hobbesian world Bremmer fears.  China's leaders, for example, have looked on with puzzlement at the British debate. China may champion national sovereignty and chafe at US dominance, but it is also pragmatic, says Kerry Brown, director of the Lau China Institute at King's College London. It gains from the existing economic order and sees multilateral economic institutions as useful - in the EU's case, to the tune of $US590 billion in trade last year. \\\"The UK is a very attractive destination for Chinese investment and financing, but after withdrawal from the EU it would be less interesting,\\\" says Brown. So when Chinese President Xi Jinping said on a visit to Britain last year that he wanted a united EU, with Britain helping to deepen Chinese-EU ties, he wasn't just chalking up a political favour to British Prime Minister David Cameron. Although the Brexit movement may well encourage similar efforts to leave in other EU countries, it is likely at the same time to accelerate new ideas to reshape the union, according to Davies. Already there are signs that some EU leaders have taken the message to heart. On Tuesday, German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said that even if Britain votes to stay, \\\"we will simply not be able to go on as before\\\". He called on Germans to recognise the EU's value to them and to understand that they do not carry an unfair share of its burden. Such calls to reform the EU have been made before - to little effect. In the long term, however, Europe can not simply return to a \\\"normal\\\" era in which nation states were pre-eminent, according to Davies, because that was never the norm but a brief and bloody aberration from other forms of European union, such as empire.\"}"
