Supply lines and its stealth coding make the fifth-generation fighter, the most expensive weapons program in Pentagon history, more difficult to keep in the air than a Delta airliner, Wilson told Sullivan.  \\\"Obviously one of them is that the spare parts lines did not start up fast enough and that's something that predates all of us, but they were so focused on initial production they did not start up and really work the logistics system fast enough,\\\" Wilson told senators. \\\"We are putting together a plan with of course the Joint Program Office because this is a joint program, it is not an Air Force program, to get the supply line right so that our operational squadrons can meet the goals that the secretary of defense has set out for us.\\\"  TOO MANY AIRPLANES: The Marine Corps appears to be in the worst shape. Heritage found about half of the service's tactical aircraft were considered flyable as of 2017. Unlike the other services, the Marines refused to release their current mission-capable rate citing \\\"operational security concerns.\\\" A spokesman said it would take a Freedom of Information Act request to get the numbers, but then he added, \\\"the aviation fleet is healthier today than it has been since 2013.\\\" The Marines fly the legacy F/A-18 Hornet, not the Navy-only F/A-18E/F Super Hornet.  Gen. Robert Neller, the Marine Corps commandant, said the good news is the service has its annual funding from Congress and not a stopgap budget to hit Mattis' goal. \\\"He told us we have got a year, so OK. I mean, I know where we are right now,\\\" Neller said during a breakfast meeting with defense reporters. Part of that solution will be getting rid of the oldest Marine Corps F/A-18 jets \\\"to take advantage of the parts we can get off of them and reduce the number of airplanes,\\\" he said.  \\\"I have said we have too many airplanes, we have got to get rid of airplanes. At some point when you get new you have got to get rid of the old ones. You can not just keep them. Now, you have got a squadron that's designed to maintain 12 airplanes and they have got to maintain 16,\\\" Neller said.  Venable warned that jettisoning jets to get capability rates up could amount to gaming the system. \\\"You can lower your sights, reduce the number of commissioned aircraft you have, and therefore your numbers go up. I would never throw that rock at Neller but this is one of those things the secretary of defense should be looking at pretty hard,\\\" he said.
