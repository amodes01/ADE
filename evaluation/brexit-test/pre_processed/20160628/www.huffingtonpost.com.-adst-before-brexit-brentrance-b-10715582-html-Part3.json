And they were right. All the American banks now are in London, not Frankfurt or Paris. Our strategy was to convince the British by stressing the leadership they could bring to Europe. I would talk as an economist but I would also use their pride, emphasizing that they could participate in a whole new integrated financial zone in which they would be a driving force. English was the language of finance.  And indeed they became one of the leading influences of the European Community, along with Germany and France. When they were still debating on European integration, the British always felt that the continent had a different set of basic principles.style=\\\"float: right; margin:10px\\\"It wasn't the Anglo-Saxon system; it was a centralized government edict almost. That is the way the commission got set up. Monnet used to travel to London very frequently and he would see Ted Heath, the leader of the Euro-skeptic Conservative Party and tell him, \\\"You guys belong in this because what you will bring to it is regularization of legal procedures, thinking of issues in terms of rule of law.\\\"He felt the British would be a liberalizing influence, particularly over the French, who had a hold over the Germans, and therefore a stranglehold on policy. They directed policy and particularly the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), which was the most protectionist policy of all.  The French felt this, and somewhat resented our efforts to integrate Britain, because it meant a loss of influence for them. They accused Britain of being a Trojan horse for the United States.The British had the same interest in liberalizing European trade policies; they had an agricultural lobby and were also done out of some markets because they could not compete. They too had a subsidy system, but it was much more sensible than the CAP. They paid individual farmers who could not produce economically.  The British joined us against the system the French wanted, which was not only to pay large subsidies to the domestic farmers but then to subsidize their exports. We felt that Britain's entry into the EEC would strengthen it as an institution, but it would also help us solve some of its flaws.  Advertisement  KLINGAMAN: I looked at if the EC integrated further economically and whether EC member countries moved toward some kind of political union: what would this mean for the rest of Europe? What would this mean for U.S. relations with Europe and so on?  It was a great way to tie Germany, of course, which was divided, together with France in some way that would make them mutually dependent and hence, the theory was, peaceful. But people were beginning to think that well now, it looks like this is in fact happening but what is it that we have been giving all this lip service to? What is it going to do to us? What will it do to our trade interests?  The EC had moved very much toward a customs union and it had also developed a common agricultural policy among the six original members with common external tariffs and quotas and what have you that were shutting out American agricultural exports. The EC was also subsidizing its agricultural exports competing with us in other markets.  There was some conference being held at the university there on European integration. Of course I presented the U.S. Government position which was yes, we favor this for various reasons\"}"
