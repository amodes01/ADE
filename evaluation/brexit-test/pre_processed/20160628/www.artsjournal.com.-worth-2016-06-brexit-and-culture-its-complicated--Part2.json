"{\"uid\": \"www.artsjournal.com.-worth-2016-06-brexit-and-culture-its-complicated--Part2\", \"text\": \"the separatist movement was quick to blame \\\"money and the ethnic vote\\\", i.e. those who were not \\\"pure\\\" Quebecers. And some, but not all, British 'Leave' voters.  I do not defend Brian True-May - he is wrong, and there is nothing non-English about having an immigrant or descendant of immigrants in Midsomer County in the pub, working in the village library, teaching in the school, or, come to that, being a cunning and sophisticated murderer. English village life certainly has a distinctive culture - 'the dart board, Wensleydale cheese, boiled cabbage cut into sections, beetroot in vinegar, 19th century Gothic churches' and all that, as T.S. Eliot put it - but to consider that to be a 'white' culture is appalling.  But wanting to preserve a culture that people feel is in danger of disappearing is entirely natural. At least half of the articles that appear on the artsjournal.com site are on this topic, laments that high culture is dying through lack of new audiences, or the poor quality of new creative work: 'the novel is dying', 'classical music is dying', and people who love those cultures feel a real loss. Likewise, as an academic I am surrounded by people conservative in their ideas on education and what a college ought to be, and that interlopers are ruining what was once so much better.  Immigration, whether from other countries or just other parts of town, changes the culture of neighborhoods. We praise diversity because we think it makes a non-superficial difference in the culture of organizations or places, not just that it will look different. I prefer cosmopolitan cultures. I am an immigrant myself, as were my parents to Canada. I think the Leave vote is a terrible result for the future of the UK (if there is one), for its economy, for the opportunities for British youth, for the people of Scotland and of Northern Ireland.  But not everyone feels that way, and there are those with strong preferences, not born of racism or bigotry, to preserve the culture that has shaped them. I think there has been a lack of appreciation of this in the immediate aftermath of the vote.\"}"
