But Birmingham is the old industrial England that globalization is leaving behind. The Midlands, where Birmingham is, voted 59% for Leave, the highest Leave vote anywhere in the country.  Not understanding the resentments in England over having much of their economy run from foreign countries, American analysts have missed the lesson of Brexit. Hillary Clinton is running exactly the campaign that the \\\"Remain\\\" side ran; predicting horrible things if the country left, trying to win by scaring people. Amazingly, Clinton has adopted as the new theme of her campaign the vacuous phrase \\\"Stronger Together,\\\" which was the theme of the losing Remain campaign in Britain.  Clinton's strength, and the Democratic Party's strength, is in coastal America, the parts of America that are like wealthy London. But the resentments over being left behind in \\\"flyover\\\" America are remarkably the same as in the vast areas of England that voted out with a shout.  Mitt Romney won 206 Electoral Votes in 2012. If Donald Trump can win Romney's states and five \\\"Rust Belt\\\" states: Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin, Michigan and Minnesota, he will be the next president.  These states have a demography and economy remarkably like the north of England. If the Democrats do not respond to the very real angst of these people who feel left behind, they will deserve to lose and they will lose. Just yelling racism and xenophobia, as liberals seem wont to do since last Thursday, will not do.  To use a very American phrase: that dog just will not hunt in this election year.\"}"
