Shares in Royal Bank of Scotland, once the world's largest bank and now mostly state-owned, fell some 15 per cent. Adding to Friday's losses, that alone has cost the U.K. taxpayer some 7.3 billion pounds ($9.6 billion) in two days.    But the turmoil is perhaps tougher for small business owners like Mr Bussey, whose 25-person firm does not have a phalanx of lawyers and a human resources department - never mind facing the expense - to seek out software developers outside of the single market.    \\\"In effect, it is closing the door on fast-growth businesses like mine in terms of hiring the best talent in Europe,\\\" Mr Bussey said.    And he's not alone. Artisan London perfume maker Sarah McCartney has found Britain's choice to leave the EU has already bruised her small business, called 4160Tuesdays.    \\\"The future does not smell so sweet at the moment,\\\" she said. \\\"I buy raw material from Europe, and I sell to Europe.
