This is forbidden by the eurozone.  The government introduced a \\u20ac5bn rescue fund called Atlante earlier this year, but this was funded largely by the banks themselves rather than the state and has been overwhelmed by events.  Mr Codogno said Italy is caught in a low-growth trap that is slowly eroding debt dynamics. \\\"I do not think the Italian system is about to blow up. We could muddle through for years, but we need to get out of this loop,\\\" he said.  Hedge fund veteran George Soros warned that Italy faces the risk of a \\\"full-blown banking crisis\\\" that could bring the rebel Five Star Movement to power as early as next year.  The banking squeeze has become politically explosive in Italy after thousands of small depositors were wiped out at four regional banks late last year. They were classified as junior bondholders, even though most of them were just ordinary savers who did not realize what was being done with their money.  Mr Renzi may be forced to take matters into his own hands and enact a unilateral sovereign rescue of the Italian banking system in defiance of the EU, unless he wins concessions soon from Brussels. Those who know him say he will not go down in flames for the sake of European ideological purity.\"}"
