The Labour party is becoming a laughing stock. The country is becoming a laughing stock because of the lack of leadership that's being shown in so many different places.  \\\"And what it says to me is that he's decided to put his own vanity ahead of the possibility of the party that he claims to love being utterly wiped out at an election that could be weeks, months away.\\\"  He added: \\\"He got the mandate. He was elected leader with a massive majority. Correct. Does he have the ability to lead? That is a bigger question, I am afraid. And sometimes leadership is about being honest with yourself. Can I do this job?

These people who have been resigning over the last few days. Some of them I know, some of them I do not know. They have seen close up - they have tried to make it work. They know it cannot work.  \\\"And they have also seen that this new politics he's talking about - I believe in a lot of the things Jeremy Corbyn says. I believe in trying to deal with division and inequality in society. I believe in trying to make the world a fairer place. Where's the policy coming from? Where's the leadership on policy coming from? Where is the arguments, other than doing what he did last night? Going to speak to the converted.  \\\"I do not know if you saw that documentary, that Vice film. Half an hour of going from hall to hall, telling the converted what they think. Did you ever see him going out to talk to small businesses about what they are trying to do? \\\"Do you ever see him trying to reach out to new support and trying to get it? We are going to get wiped out if he stays on as leader.\\\"\"}"
