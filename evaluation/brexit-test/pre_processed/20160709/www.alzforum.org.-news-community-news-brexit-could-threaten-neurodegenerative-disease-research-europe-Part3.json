Roxana Carare at the University of Southampton said that none of her colleagues know whether they can still apply for upcoming EU grants. The uncertainty is distracting her and colleagues from their work. \\\"But until somebody tells us not to, we are still carrying on with our grant applications and going on as normal,\\\" Carare told Alzforum.  Impeding the Free Flow of Researchers and Ideas  Equally concerning as funding is the question of how Brexit will affect the ability of researchers to move freely between labs. Currently, 15 percent of academic staff at U.K. universities, and up to 20 percent at elite universities, come from EU countries, according to Nature. Many EU programs promote the flow of research labor, including the Erasmus+ exchange program for students and Marie Curie fellowships for postdocs. European Research Council grants for young scientists can be used anywhere in the EU. Forty percent of the people in Isaacs' UCL lab come from other EU nations. \\\"We benefit enormously from recruiting the best international talent from around the world,\\\" he wrote to Alzforum.  Now the future of EU workers in the U.K. is up in the air. As a non-member state, the U.K. might lose access to fellowship programs. The referendum made EU students in the U.K., who currently pay the same rates as British students, worry that they will have to fork over three times as much to meet international tuition rates, Carare said. Travel may become more difficult as well. In the future, some students are likely to need visas in order to move between U.K. and the EU, and transferring students may become impractical. Spires-Jones said that she and colleagues in the EU frequently swap students, and were planning to launch a joint Ph.D. program to encourage further cross-training and dissemination of ideas. \\\"Now I will be cut out of that,\\\" she said.  The referendum has already caused EU scientists to feel unwelcome in the U.K. \\\"The tone of the debate here and the initial response to the outcome of the vote have done significant damage \\u2026 This will very likely impact the recruitment and retention of talented researchers here,\\\" Livesey wrote. Guerreiro, who hails from Portugal, noted, \\\"It is difficult not to feel that the many hours we give to research could be more useful and appreciated in a different country.\\\" Carare said that she normally gets several emails a week from researchers asking about coming to work in her lab. \\\"Since the vote, it's all gone quiet,\\\" she told Alzforum. Scientists fear a brain drain from the U.K., because in addition to fewer scientists coming in, U.K. researchers might leave for countries with more favorable funding and working conditions. \\\"[Brexit] will make U.K. science less competitive; established researchers will always opt for open and collaborative systems, and the best students will find other good universities that are easier to apply for,\\\" Guerreiro predicted.  Worlds Apart: Separate Regulations Could Splinter Projects, Slow Trials  Not only U.K. science may be affected. The fallout from Brexit could damage international collaborations and big science projects, many of which are based in the U.K. These include the TRANSEURO consortium to advance stem cell treatments for Parkinson's disease, based in Cambridge, and the European Prevention of Alzheimer's Disease (EPAD) consortium, which tests interventions at preclinical stages (see Dec\"}"
