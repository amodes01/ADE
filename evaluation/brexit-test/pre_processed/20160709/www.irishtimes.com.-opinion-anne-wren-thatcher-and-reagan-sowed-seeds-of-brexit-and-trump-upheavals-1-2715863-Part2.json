And that distinction defined the Brexit vote. The winners - the college-educated, those with high incomes, those working in areas like London where the new economy is flourishing - voted to Remain. The losers - those without college educations, with low incomes, in areas that have been decimated by deindustrialisation - voted to Leave.  Why they did so should not be a puzzle. We do not need to look back more than 80 years to understand that economic insecurity creates an environment ripe for political manipulation.  Racism and isolation  Throw in concerns over terrorism and national security; justified distrust of political elites over their complicity in, and response to, the financial crisis, and issues such as the expenses scandal in the UK; and a  Brussels  bureaucracy perceived as distant and undemocratic, and the task of selling racist and isolationist solutions to economic insecurity becomes even easier.  Equally at fault with Nigel Farage, Trump and others have been the parties of the left. Not only in the UK and the US, but also across Europe, left-wing parties have failed to act decisively to argue for a strategy of major social investment that is inclusive of those groups excluded from the benefits of economic change.  Even in Sweden, in the heartland of social democracy, the principal winners from the 2014 electoral revolt against years of centre-right cuts to welfare state spending were not the social democrats, but the far right anti-immigrant Sweden democrats.  Electoral upheavals are symptoms of the scale of the social challenge posed by major economic change. The challenge of responding to deindustrialisation and of implementing social investment to ensure the benefits of the new high-tech service economy are more widely shared is a major one. It has nothing to do with immigration. And it will not be solved by closing borders. It is faced by all of Europe. And it is faced by post-Brexit UK as much as pre-. Given its negative implications for economic growth across Europe, and negative political impact in fanning the flames of right-wing populism, Brexit has simply made the problem more difficult to address.
