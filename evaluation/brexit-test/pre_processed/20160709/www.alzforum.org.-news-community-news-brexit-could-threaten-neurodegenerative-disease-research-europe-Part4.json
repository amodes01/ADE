Numerous other neurodegenerative disease projects are based in the U.K. or rely on collaborations there, such as the Oxford Project to Investigate Memory and Ageing (OPTIMA), the Cognitive Function and Ageing Study (CFAS), the Genetic FTD initiative (GENFI1), and the Imaging of Neuroinflammation in Neurodegenerative Diseases (INMiND) consortium (see Nov 2014 conference news; Mar 2013 conference news).  Leaders of these projects point out that EU funding underlies their success. EU grants enabled the TRANSEURO consortium to establish the necessary infrastructure and network of scientists across several countries, wrote Roger Barker at University of Cambridge, who coordinates the project. Without such funding, the next generation of stem cell-based therapies may suffer, he predicted. Craig Ritchie at the University of Edinburgh, who leads EPAD, told Alzforum that this consortium will continue to be directed from within the U.K. (see full comment below).  Researchers also wonder how access to information might change. Currently, research data can be freely shared across the EU, but post-Brexit restrictions could hinder international collaborations, Carare said. Other roadblocks may emerge as well. Now, all EU nations share the same regulations for using human material such as tissue and fluid samples, but if the U.K. develops its own set of regulations, collaborations could slow down further, Carare suggested. De Strooper sees a bleak future if these issues cannot be resolved. \\\"It is unclear how long British scientists will continue to be involved in the big European science programs,\\\" he wrote to Alzforum.  For drug trials as well, the U.K.'s exit could create challenges, possibly requiring that separate trials be run in the U.K. and EU if regulations differ. How this would affect pharmaceutical company investment is unclear. Catherine Falcetti at Biogen told Alzforum that for the moment, the company is operating \\\"business as usual\\\" in the U.K. and EU. \\\"We will continue to evaluate the need to amend or adjust our current operations in the U.K. on an ongoing basis, and have a working group in place that will monitor the situation closely,\\\" she wrote. Representatives from several other companies did not respond to requests for comment.  The U.K. is currently involved in 40 percent of trials for adult rare diseases, according to the BBC. Some Brexit proponents have suggested a split from the EU could aid U.K. trials, as EU trial requirements were widely considered overly burdensome, causing a steady decline in the annual number of trials run since 2001. However, the EU process was recently streamlined (see 2014 Nature story). U.K. scientists pointed out that to run international trials, they would have to abide by EU regulations anyway, and Brexit is unlikely to benefit efforts to harmonize trial protocols.  Reuters reported that the European Medicines Agency, the EU equivalent of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which is currently headquartered in London, will have to move to another city in an EU nation. EMA representative Sophie Labb\\u00e9 declined to comment on this, but said in a statement, \\\"EMA's procedures and work streams are not affected by the outcome of the referendum.\\\"  Altogether, researchers foresee a more fractured research landscape post-Brexit. \\\"This is the 21st century-we should be about unity and partnership, not division and isolationism,\\\" lamented Stuart Pickering-Brown at the University of Manchester, in an email to Alzforum (see full comment below).
