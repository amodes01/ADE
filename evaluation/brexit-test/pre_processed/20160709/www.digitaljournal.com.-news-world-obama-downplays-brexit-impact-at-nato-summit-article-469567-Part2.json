What we have seen is we are committed and we are ready to stay,\\\" Stoltenberg said of a war which has dragged on since 2001.  The 28-nation US-led alliance would look at the situation again next year, Stoltenberg said.  US President Barack Obama was forced this week to slow the US pullout due to the \\\"precarious\\\" security situation. Some 8,400 US troops will now remain in the war-ravaged country into next year, not 5,500 as planned.  The summit opened Friday under very heavy security overshadowed first by Britain's shock vote to quit the European Union and then the deadly shootings of police officers in Dallas.  The White House said Obama would now cut short a later stop in Spain to be able to visit Dallas next week.\"}"
