Support for remaining within the EU was strongest among those with college educations and higher incomes, and in the city of London; opposition was strongest among the less educated and less well-off, and in Britain's former industrial heartlands. Only in Scotland, where the issue of EU membership has obvious links with that of regional autonomy within the UK, were these patterns muted.  The parallels with support for Donald Trump in the US are strong. White voters without college educations are a far more important component of Trump's support base than the typical Republican party candidate. And support for Trump is also strong in regions where traditional economic sectors used to dominate, and unemployment rates are high.  These patterns reveal deep underlying social divisions that have almost nothing to do with immigration and everything to do with deindustrialisation and the decline of the traditional economy. And they have been decades in the making.  Since the early 1970s, employment in traditional sectors (manufacturing, mining, agriculture) has declined by about two-thirds in the UK. Formerly, these sectors provided stable and relatively well-paid employment for millions of British workers: currently less than 10 per cent of the working-age population actually find these types of jobs. This trend is not just a UK phenomenon. It is visible in all of the world's most developed economies. It is attributable in some part to increased global economic competition; but also in large part to other aspects of economic development such as technological change, and changes in consumption patterns in the developed economies.  READ MORE  The transition away from reliance on traditional industrial sectors and towards services and ICT-intensive manufacturing greatly increases the inequalities in opportunity between those with college educations and those without. The spread of the new technologies and the expansion of high-end service markets has increased the demand for workers with a college degree, at the same time as deindustrialisation has reduced the demand for workers with mid-range skills. Without significant social investment, these changes can create sharp increases in inequality in wages, economic opportunities and life chances.  Disinvestment and deregulation  In the face of this major social upheaval, the UK and US took the lead under the Thatcher and Reagan governments in the 1980s in embarking on a strategy - not of investment - but of disinvestment and of radical deregulation. Deregulation has allowed the financial sectors in these countries to flourish and make an important contribution to economic growth (although in its most unfettered form it also facilitated the kinds of abuses that lead to the financial and economic crises of the last decade). It has also been associated, however, with the removal of protections on workers' employment rights and incomes, with rapidly increasing inequality, and with higher levels of economic insecurity for less-skilled workers in particular.  At the same time, the increased privatisation of educational systems in both of these countries has moved access to higher education further out of the reach of children from less economically advantaged backgrounds. And disinvestment in public housing, in the national health system, in training and in other public services has further reduced the security of life chances of those groups that have seen their labour market opportunities decline.
