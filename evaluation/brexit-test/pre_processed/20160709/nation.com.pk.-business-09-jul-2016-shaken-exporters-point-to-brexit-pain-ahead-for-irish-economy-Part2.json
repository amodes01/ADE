The uncertainty is just chaotic, this is a real risk.\\\"  Irish firms are being encouraged by trade bodies to look to new markets but that can be easier said than done. Byrne said she could look to the United States but differing state laws make the process far more complex for her risk analytics.  \\\"We have no idea what the future holds, just none,\\\" she said.  \\\"THIS WILL COST JOBS\\\"  While Ireland's economy is forecast to be Europe's best performing for a third straight year, it needs all the growth it can get to cut a public debt that, while down from a peak of 124 percent of GDP, stood at 94 percent of annual output last year.  Ireland's fiscal watchdog estimates that if forecast GDP growth comes in 1.5 percentage points lower each year, it would cause the debt-to-GDP ratio to stagnate at current high levels before rising again by the end of the decade.  That could scupper government plans to grow the workforce by 12 percent to 2.2 million over the next six years.  Experienced exporters like 65-year-old Jimmy McGee, owner of the Athlone Extrusions manufacturing firm, have been through enough downturns to know that difficult times may lie ahead.  \\\"I believe this will cost jobs in Ireland. It's just too large,\\\" said McGee, who is confident layoffs will not be needed at his firm because it exports sheeting for baths and shower trays to 41 countries other than the UK.  \\\"After a tough few years, companies had got the confidence back to invest. That's under threat. There is no stability right now and I do not think there will be for some time.\\\"\"}"
