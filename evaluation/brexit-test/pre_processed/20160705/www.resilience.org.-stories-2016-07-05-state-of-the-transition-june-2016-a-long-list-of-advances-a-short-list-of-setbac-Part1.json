The list of main setbacks for the global energy transition in June includes a potentially big one: Brexit. But when you view that vote in the light of the month's long list of main advances, and the other such long lists for January through May 2016, plus the three years before, dots join to tell a story. If the British are collectively ill advised enough to go ahead with their exit from the EU, they risk creating an isolated island that will be a stark outlier on an increasingly clear and positive direction of travel in the rest of the world.  Global renewable energy statistics for 2015 were published this month. 147 gigawatts of were installed, and investment in renewables is now twice that going to coal & gas combined. Solar PV global capacity continues to rise exponentially as a consequence. Onshore wind and PV will \\\"win the cost race\\\" globally and become the cheapest two energy options in many nations by 2020. In some markets, they already are. In India, solar has become the fastest-growing new energy source. China is on course to generate fully a quarter of its electricity from wind power by 2030.  In the USA, solar accounted for 64% of all new electricity that came online during Q1 2016. The customers of a single solar company produced 10 gigawatt hours of solar electricity in a single day (SolarCity). That is much the same as a fully operational nuclear power plant. Some 60 of the hundred largest US companies by sales have set goals for renewable-energy procurement, greenhouse gas emissions reductions and energy efficiency. Among them, Apple set up up an energy company, and applied to supply excess solar electricity from its installations to customers of all types. Recall that Apple also intends to be mass producing solar-charged EVs by 2020.  In the UK, solar beat coal over a whole month of UK electricity generation for first time in May. No longer can it be argued that renewables are incapable of powering modern industry: Nissan will power a factory in the UK partly with solar and wind. Its 11 megawatts of renewables (not much at all) will be enough to make 31,000 cars a year. They will be EVs.  With 1 million now on the world's roads, EVs are on track for a 2\\u02daC global-warming scenario scenario, the goal of the UN's Paris agreement on climate change. (But note, they are the only sector on track so far). The zeitgeist here is becoming clear. Most notably this month, Volkswagen announced a plan to seek redemption from its emissions fraud crimes via a strategy centred on EVs, robo-taxis, and a ride sharing network. The knock on effects of battery development for EVs on use of storage in buildings continued in June. BMW announced a small commercial energy storage solution, joining frontrunner Tesla, and other big corporate movers like GE. French oil major Total entered the residential power market by acquiring Lampiris, Belgium's third-largest natural gas and renewable power vendor for the residential sector. This on top of its earlier major investments in solar (Sunpower) and batteries (Saft). At least one of the oil majors is seriously hedging its bets on the great global energy transition.  On June 13th, Dong Energy, a renewable energy company, became the largest IPO anywhere in the world so far this year. Dong was once an oil and gas company: its name stands for Danish Oil and Gas. Now 75% of its capital is going into renewables. Lesson: oil and gas companies can make it across the energy transition, no matter what Shell and the others tell us.  Successful IPOs or not, the\"}"
