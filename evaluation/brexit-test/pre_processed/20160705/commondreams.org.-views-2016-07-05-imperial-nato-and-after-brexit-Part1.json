He urged us not to give into hysteria and stressed that NATO did not disappear with Brexit. The Trans-Atlantic alliance, he reminded the world, endures.1 In the face of what may be the slow motion breakup of the European Union under pressure from Euro skeptics, look for U.S. and allied European elites to increase their commitments to the sixty-seven year NATO alliance. The hysteria that was manufactured in the wake of Russia's seizure of Crimea and intervention in eastern Ukraine and fears of the fallout from the continuing wars and catastrophes in the Middle East will serve as NATO's selling points.  As we face the future, either/or thinking and NATO need to be left behind.  But, as we face the future, either/or thinking and NATO need to be left behind. As even President Carter's National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski taught, since its inception NATO has been an imperial project.2 Rather than creating a new, full-blown and extremely dangerous Cold War, our interests and survival depend on Common Security diplomacy3 rather than the repeated and deadly failures of militarism.  This does not mean turning blind eyes to Putin's assault on free speech and democracy, or to Moscow's nuclear saber rattling and cyberattacks.4 But it does mean that we should be mindful that Common Security diplomacy ended the Cold War, that repressive and brutal though Putin may be, he arrested Russia's calamitous Yeltsin-era freefall, and he played critical roles in the elimination of Syria's chemical weapons and the P-5+1 nuclear deal with Iran. We also need to acknowledge that with two million people in U.S. prisons, including Guantanamo, the embrace of the Poland's autocratic government and Saudi monarchy, and the militarized \\\"Pivot to Asia\\\" the U.S. leads a not-so-free world.  Zero-sum thinking is not in anyone's interest. There are Common Security alternatives to today's increasing and dangerous military tensions.  We oppose NATO because of its neo-colonial domination of most of Europe, its roles in imperial wars and domination, the existential nuclear threat it poses to human survival, and because it diverts funds from essential social services, truncating lives in the U.S. and other nations.  William Faulkner wrote that \\\"the past is not dead, that it is not even past,\\\" a truth that reverberates with the Brexit vote. Our approach to the present and to the future must thus be informed by the tragedies of history. Central and Eastern European nations including Poland have been conquered, ruled and oppressed by Lithuanians, Swedes, Germans, Tatars, Ottomans and Russians -as well as by home grown despots. And Poland was once the imperial power in Ukraine.  Given this history and other considerations, it's madness to risk nuclear annihilation to enforce the borders at any given moment. And as we learned from the Common Security resolution of the Cold War, our survival depends on challenging traditional security thinking. Spiraling tensions that come with military alliances, arms races, military-industrial complexes and chauvinistic nationalism can be overcome with commitments to mutual respect.  1913?  This is an era with similarities to the years preceding the First World War. The world is marked by rising and declining powers anxious to retain or expand their privilege and power. We have arms races with new technologies; resurgent nationalism, territorial disputes, resource competition, complex alliance\"}"
