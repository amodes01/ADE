Since the war on Serbia, contrary to the U.N. Charter, the U.S. and NATO invaded Afghanistan and Iraq, destroyed Libya, and eight NATO nations are now at war in Syria. But we have the irony of NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg saying that there can be no business as usual until Russia respects international law.11  Recall that NATO's first secretary general, Lord Ismay explained that the alliance was designed \\\"to keep the Germans down, the Russians out and the Americans in\\\", which is not the way to build a common European home. It was created before the Warsaw Pact, when Russia was still reeling from the Nazi devastation. Unfair though it was, the Yalta agreement which divided Europe into U.S. and Soviet spheres, was seen by U.S. policy makers as the price to be paid for Moscow having driven Hitler's forces across eastern and central Europe. With the history of Napoleon, the Kaiser and Hitler, the U.S. establishment understood that Stalin had reason to fear future invasions from the West. The U.S. was thus complicit in Moscow's repressive colonization of Eastern European and Baltic nations.  Sometimes the U.S. \\\"national security\\\" elite tell the truth. Zbigniew Brzezinski, formerly President Carter's National Security Advisor, published a primer describing how what he termed the U.S. \\\"imperial project\\\"12 works. Geostrategically, he explained, dominance over the Eurasian heartland is essential to being the world's dominant power. To project coercive power into the Eurasian heartland, as an \\\"island power\\\" not located in Eurasia, the U.S. requires toeholds on Eurasia's western, southern and eastern peripheries. What Brzezinski termed \\\"vassal state\\\" NATO allies, make possible 'entrench[ment of] American political influence and military power on the Eurasian mainland.\\\" In the wake of the Brexit vote, U.S. and European elites will rely even more heavily on NATO in their effort to hold Europe together and to reinforce U.S. influence.  There is more than integrating European territory, resources and technologies into the U.S. dominated systems. As former Secretary of War Rumsfeld put it, in the tradition of divide and conquer, by playing New (Eastern and Central) Europe against Old Europe in the West, Washington won French, German and the Dutch support for the war to depose Saddam Hussein.  And with what even the New York Times describes as \\\"right-wing, nationalist assault on the country's media and judiciary\\\" and the \\\"retreat from the fundamental values of liberal democracy\\\" by the Kacynski government, the U.S. has had no hesitation in making Poland the eastern hub of NATO.13 Washington's rhetoric about its commitments to democracy is belied by its long history of supporting dictators and repressive regimes in Europe, monarchies like the Saudis, as well as by its wars of conquest from the Philippines and Vietnam to Iraq and Libya.  Washington's European toehold has also reinforced its hold on Southern Eurasia's resource rich periphery. NATO's wars in Afghanistan and the Middle East follow in the tradition of European colonialism. Before the Ukraine crisis, the Pentagon's strategic guidance14 tasked NATO with ensuring control of mineral resources and trade while reinforcing the encirclement of China as well as Russia.15 Thus NATO adopted its \\\"out of area\"}"
