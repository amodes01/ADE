I thought British politics were in serious trouble when I served as deputy chief of mission and charg\\u00e9 d'affaires at the US Embassy between 2007 and 2010. But the situation now is in a whole different category.    British Prime Minister David Cameron, who will long be remembered as the author of an ill-conceived referendum designed only for electoral advantage, decided after the vote that he would rather go on permanent vacation than actually try to lead his country into a new and supposedly improved relationship with Europe. His Conservative Party colleagues quickly transformed the leadership competition into a sordid little soap opera, with the clever/devious Michael Gove somehow prompting the clever, reduced, and frightened Brexit supporter Boris Johnson into heading for the hills himself, another self-serving exit from the scene of the accident he had just been a large part of causing. Now the Brexit wing of the Tories seems to be seeking party leadership that was the purest about wanting to leave the European Union, with the possible result that they could advance the careers of some otherwise unimpressive minor figures into the leadership of the United Kingdom.  The continuously feckless Labour Party grew even less impressive as Labour Members of Parliament indicated no confidence in their leader, Jeremy Corbyn, who has nevertheless declined to leave. Corbyn seems intent on bringing former British Prime Minister Tony Blair to justice over his decision to enter the Iraq war. His cause, perhaps a noble one, could be assisted by the long-awaited release on July 6 of the Chilcot Report, which documents the UK's role in the Iraq war. But it is not what is needed at this historical moment. The chances of Labour producing an impressive set of new leaders that will go on to challenge the Tories in a convincing way is not a development for which London bookmakers are providing decent odds.  Even Queen Elizabeth II felt the need to recommend that UK politicos allow \\\"sufficient room for quiet thinking and contemplation, which can enable deeper, cooler consideration of how challenges and opportunities can be best addressed.\\\" Fat chance. And it was delicious accidental irony that she delivered these words at the opening of the Scotland's Parliament, where the first reaction of Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon following the Brexit vote was a quick trip to Brussels to assure EU leaders that the Scots wanted nothing to do with what was an essentially English decision, and to note that the Scots had indicated the same by an overwhelming vote to remain in the EU.  All this could be written off as a tragicomic summer opera during London's season of Wimbledon, Ascot, Henley, and Glastonbury if it were not so genuinely damaging. The UK vote to leave the EU will damage Europe and damage US interests in Europe for many years to come. The degree of the damage will, to some extent, be a function of the degree of wise leadership in the UK and Europe over the next two years, and that's a dicey proposition at best.  The Brexit wreckage that the United States will need to reckon with now and for the next few years falls into overlapping political, security, and economic categories. The self-inflicted political uncertainty will make the UK a considerably less able partner to deal with the genuine pressing issues of the day. Weak and inexperienced new leaders will be preoccupied with developing a form of \\\"no-fault insurance\\\"\"}"
