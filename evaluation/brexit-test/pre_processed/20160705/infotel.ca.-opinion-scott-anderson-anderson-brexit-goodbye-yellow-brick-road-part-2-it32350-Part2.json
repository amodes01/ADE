It worked, sort of, as an economic union, but as a political union it is as profound a failure as the former Soviet Union.  And yet even now, in the wake of Brexit, amidst a deluge of Euroscepticism and a dangerous rise in cultural animosities, the enlightened ones are still blind to it. Instead of trying to understand and accommodate the phenomenon sweeping across Europe and the western world, Western political leaders prefer to mock it, like Charles I faced with Parliamentary revolt, secure in the conviction of their own rightness. French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault epitomised this haughty intransigence when he opined in the wake of Brexit, \\\"We have to give a new sense to Europe otherwise populism will fill the gap.\\\" The problem to him wasn't the EU itself, but rather the marketing of it that needed fixing. Luxembourg's Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn put it more directly: \\\"I believe you can destroy the European Union with referenda.\\\"  These glimpses into the intellectual heart of the integration programme underscore an embedded disdain for the will of the people and indeed for democracy itself... if the Brexit vote had been \\\"Remain\\\" they would have heralded it as a triumph of democracy and applauded the wisdom of the people, but God forbid that the great unwashed should have a say if their say is going to be \\\"Piss off.\\\"  Be prepared. The same backlash is coming to North America. In the United States it's already here. The enlightened ones will mock it and call its prophets fools and knaves, but it behoves the rest of us to try to understand it. Perhaps even, after much thought, join it?  - Scott Anderson is a freelance writer.
