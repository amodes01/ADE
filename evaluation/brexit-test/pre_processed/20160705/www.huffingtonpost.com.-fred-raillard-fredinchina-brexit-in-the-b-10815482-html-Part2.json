This is quite shocking as it's like a new shareholder asking the boss of Virgin to leave his company! This is now at the forefront of every business conversation, and has become like a reality show with everyone wanting to know what is going to happen. There were a lot of conversations on Chinese social media surrounding this topic, and how unfair this is towards such a great leader. Nobody really knows what will happen, but we should find out very soon! The early predictions are that he will be fired from his company.  China resents the oblivion of a part of their population: the working class  The HotPost of the week is a photo documentary about really hard workers in a metal factory. It's about the lives of these people who are pretty old, who's work consists of carrying the raw materials to make metal. It's almost like modern slavery in a way, because the conditions are so incredibly tough. They have to move approximately 300 tons every day, and are paid only 60 cent RMB per ton, making about 200 RMB every day which is about 3 euro per day. Their living and working conditions are just shocking! The documentary is very emotional and shows the gap between the modern and digital forward-thinking Tier 1 Chinese cities and this other China in the countryside.  A lot of people were extremely touched by this documentary and felt a lot of empathy towards the workers. Especially people from Tier 1 cities who cannot believe that this is still happening in 2016, calling on the government to act and help these people. In a way, the documentary was very useful, by showing the plight of these workers and generating engagement, generating 234,000 retweets on Sina Weibo, and 200,000 likes.\"}"
