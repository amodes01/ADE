Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin-who was reviled by Ukraine's reformers-was recently replaced by Yuriy Lutsenko, who plans to establish an inspector general's office within the office. Lutsenko was initially criticized for being too loyal to Poroshenko and for lacking a law degree, but Yatsenyuk said, \\\"I have full trust in him. He wants to deliver.\\\"  He also praised the sweeping judicial reforms that parliament passed in early June. Sensibly noting that \\\"you can not win the fight against corruption having corrupt judges,\\\" he pointed out that Ukraine has started vetting judges. Only about 250 of the country's 7,600 judges have been vetted yet, so much remains to be done.  Parliament also passed a law that forces officials to disclose their assets, the so-called e-declaration. Yatsenyuk described the document as forty pages long and \\\"much tougher than [similar requirements] in the United States.\\\"  Civil service reform \\\"that resembles the Polish experience\\\" was another step forward. However, he admitted, public sector workers earn extremely low wages and bribes are the only way for many people to feed their families. To solve this, Yatsenyuk has asked donors for a top-up fund to increase salaries in the transition period. \\\"To attract smart, effective folks, you need to pay them,\\\" he said.  He also urged better European cooperation with Ukraine's anti-corruption investigators. Ukraine launched an investigation into the misdeeds of two officials last year and received no response from the Europeans for a year.  But Yatsenyuk wasn't forthcoming about everything. When asked about the status of Ukraine's 1.8 million internally displaced persons, he said, \\\"The situation is more or less under control,\\\" a remarkably tone-deaf response.  Conditions are wretched for many IDPs, and those who live on the contact line lack access to water, gas and food and face daily shelling. While the Ukrainian government provides social assistance and pensions to IDPs, those payments were suspended earlier this year due to \\\"inconsistencies in legislation,\\\" leaving 350,000 IDPs without pensions and 15,000 without social payments.  Yatsenyuk has famously described his job as prime minister as a \\\"kamikaze mission.\\\" He had to pass a series of unpopular austerity measures in the midst of a plunging economy, and keep the country united while repelling the Russians. He knows his legacy is still uncertain. With a wry expression, he said, \\\"I am not the most popular politician in my country, but history is to judge us. So let us wait and see.\\\"  Melinda Haring is the editor of the UkraineAlert at the Atlantic Council.\"}"
