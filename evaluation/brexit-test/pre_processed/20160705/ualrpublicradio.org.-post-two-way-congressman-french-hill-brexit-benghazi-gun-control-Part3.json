I think that's something Mr. Cornyn is working on and I look forward to seeing the language.  The other point that's of some importance is that most gun deaths in this country are suicide and a lot of mass killings have a behavioral health aspect, it's the preponderance to have some sort of diagnosed behavioral health issue.  I am a big supporter of a comprehensive approach to mental health which we have not had in this country for 35 years. I have encouraged the Speaker and have some encouragement back from leadership that we will be able to vote on a mental health bill in the coming days. I think that's at the core of some of these mass shootings. If people get the mental health treatment they need, they are not on the streets or in a jail cell.  KAUFFMAN: I got an e-mail from your Democratic opponent Dianne Curry on the issue of the Pentagon ending its ban on transgender troops in the military. She supports the move. Have you got a chance to think about that decision to lift the ban?  HILL: I think Secretary Carter has reviewed the planning from the uniform services secretaries and the joint staffs to lift the ban. I think that will be done in a provisional way and be subject to oversight in Congress to see how that's being done and under what circumstances. I think between the leadership in the Pentagon and the House and Senate Armed Services Committee they will sort through what the right way and right time frame is to do that.  KAUFFMAN: Do you think it's a good idea to try to be exploring though? To try to include transgender people in the military?  HILL: I think people that are qualified to serve in the military, you know, subject to the uniform command's approval and engagement of just what those rules and capabilities are, is...that's why we have our joint chiefs and our civilian control of the military to decide that, who is physically and mentally able to serve our country in uniform and to do that in a fair and equitable manner? I think that's what the whole issue is, can that be done in the right way in this particular instance.\"}"
