From early on, the realistic alternative was creation of a neutral Ukraine, tied economically to both the E.U. and Russia.  NATO: A Nuclear Alliance  In addition to the Ukraine crisis, we now have Washington's and NATO's campaign to topple the Assad dictatorship and Russia's military intervention in Syria to reinforce its Middle East military and political toehold. Russia will not abandon Assad, and enforcing the \\\"no-fly\\\" zone that Hillary Clinton advocates would require destruction of Russian anti-aircraft missile, risking military escalation.  Friends, we are told that U.S. nuclear weapons are deployed only to deter possible nuclear attacks. But, as Bush the Lesser's Pentagon informed the world, their primary purpose is to prevent other nations from taking actions that are inimical to U.S. interests.  Ukraine and Syria remind us that NATO is a nuclear alliance, and that the dangers of a catastrophic nuclear exchange did not disappear with the end of the Cold War. Once again we hear the madness that \\\"NATO will not be able to leave things at conventional armament\\\" and that a \\\"Credible deterrent will involve nuclear weapons...\\\"22  How serious is the nuclear danger? Putin tells us that he considered the possible use of nuclear weapons to reinforce Russian control of Crimea. And, Daniel Ellsberg reported that U.S. and Russian nuclear forces were on high alert in the early stages of the Ukraine crisis.23  Friends, we are told that U.S. nuclear weapons are deployed only to deter possible nuclear attacks. But, as Bush the Lesser's Pentagon informed the world, their primary purpose is to prevent other nations from taking actions that are inimical to U.S. interests.24 Since they were first deployed, these weapons have been used for more than classical deterrence.  Former Secretary of War Harold Brown testified that they serve another purpose. With nuclear weapons, he testified, U.S. conventional forces became \\\"meaningful instruments of military and political power.\\\" Noam Chomsky explains that this means \\\"we have succeeded in sufficiently intimidating anyone who might help protect people who we are determined to attack.\\\"25  Beginning with the Iran crisis of 1946 - before the Soviet Union was a nuclear power - through the Bush-Obama \\\"all options are on the table\\\" threats against Iran, nuclear weapons in Europe have served as the ultimate enforcers of US Middle East hegemony. U.S. nuclear weapons in Europe were placed on alert during Nixon's \\\"madman\\\" nuclear mobilization to intimidate Vietnam, Russia and China, and they were likely placed on alert during other Asian wars and crises.26  NATO's nuclear weapons serve yet another purpose: preventing the \\\"decoupling\\\" from the United States. During the 2010 Lisbon Summit, in order to limit NATO member states' options, \\\"widely shared responsibility for deployment and operational support\\\" for nuclear war preparations was reaffirmed. More, it was proclaimed that \\\"Any change in this policy, including the geographic distribution of NATO nuclear deployments in Europe, should be made ... by the Alliance as a whole...Broad participation of the non-nuclear Allies is an essential sign of transatlantic solidarity and risk sharing.\\\"27 And now, on the eve of the NATO summit and the deployment of new B-61-12 nuclear warheads in Europe, General Breedlove, until recently NATO's Supreme Commander, has insisted that the U.S. must enhance its nuclear exercises\"}"
