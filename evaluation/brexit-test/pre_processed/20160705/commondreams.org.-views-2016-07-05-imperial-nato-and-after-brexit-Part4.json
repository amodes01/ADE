This, in turn, has metastasized rather than eliminated extremist resistance and terrorism. Fifteen NATO nations participate in the Alliance Ground Surveillance (AGS) drone system operated from a NATO base in Italy, with NATO's Global Hawk killer drones operated from the Ramstein Air Base in Germany.17  Ukraine and NATO's Expansion  An increasing number of U.S. strategic analysts, including former Commander in Chief of the U.S. Strategic Command General Lee Butler have said that U.S. post-Cold War \\\"triumphalism,\\\" treating Russia like a \\\"dismissed serf,\\\" and NATO's expansion to Russia's boarders despite the Bush I-Gorbachev agreement precipitated today's spiraling military tensions with Russia.18 Russia did not precipitate the Ukraine crisis. NATO's expansion to Russia's borders, Ukraine's designation as a NATO \\\"aspirant\\\" country, and the Kosovo and Iraq War precedents each played their roles.  What have the coup and civil war brought us? One set of corrupt oligarchs replacing another. Death and suffering. Fascist forces once allied with Hitler now part of Ukraine's ruling elite, and hardliners in Washington, Moscow, and across Europe reinforced.  This is not to say that Putin is innocent as he revitalizes his corrupt neo-Tsarist state and campaigns to reassert Russian political influence in its \\\"near abroad\\\" and Europe itself, and as he hitches Russia's economy and military to China. But, on our side, we have Secretary Kerry's Orwellian doublespeak. He decried Moscow's \\\"incredible act of aggression\\\" in Ukraine, saying \\\"you just do not in the 21st century behave in 19th century fashion by invading another country on [a] completely trumped up pretext.\\\"19 Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, and Libya disappeared down his memory hole!  Great powers have long intervened in Ukraine, and this was the case with the Maidan coup. Leading up to the coup, Washington and the E.U. poured billions of dollars into developing and nurturing Ukrainian allies to turn the former Soviet republic away from Moscow and toward the West. Many forget the E. U.'s ultimatum to the corrupt Yanukovych government: Ukraine could take the next steps toward E.U. membership only by burning its bridges to Moscow, to which eastern Ukraine had been economically tied for decades. As tensions built in Kiev, CIA Director Brennan, Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland -famous for her \\\"fuck the E.U.\\\" disrespect of Washington's vassals - and Senator McCain journeyed to Maidan to encourage revolution. And, once the shooting began, the U.S. and the E.U. failed to hold their Ukrainian allies to the April Geneva power sharing agreement.  The truth is that both the Western political interventions and Russia's annexation of Crimea violated the Budapest Memorandum of 1994, which committed the powers to \\\"respect the independence, sovereignty and existing borders of Ukraine,\\\"20 and to \\\"refrain from the threat of use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of Ukraine.\\\" What was it that Hitler said about treaties being just scraps of paper?  What have the coup and civil war brought us? One set of corrupt oligarchs replacing another.21 Death and suffering. Fascist forces once\"}"
