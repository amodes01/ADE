Remembering the consequences of the bullets fired by an assassin's gun in Sarajevo a century ago, we have reason to worry about what might happen if a frightened or overly aggressive U.S., Russian or Polish soldier, pushed beyond their limits, in anger or by accident, fires the anti-aircraft missile that brings down a U.S., NATO or another Russian warplane.  Competing NATO and Russian military exercises are ratcheting up military tensions to the point that former U.S. Secretary of Defense Perry warns that nuclear war is now more likely than during the cold war.6 Carl Conetta was right when he wrote \\\"NATO's militaristic response\\\" to Russia in Ukraine \\\"is a perfect example of reflective action-reaction cycles.\\\" Moscow, he explains, lacks \\\"the will to suicide...it has no intention of attacking NATO.\\\"7 Last month's Anaconda-2016, involving 31,000 NATO troops - 14,000 of them here in Poland - and troops from 24 countries was the largest war game in Eastern Europe since the Cold War.8 Imagine Washington's response if Russia or China conducted similar war games on the Mexican border.  Given NATO's expansions to its borders; its new tactical headquarters in Poland and Romania; its increased military deployments and provocative military exercises across Eastern Europe, the Baltic states, Scandinavia and the Black Sea, as well as by the U.S. quadrupling its military spending for Europe, we should not be surprised that Russia is attempting to \\\"counterbalance\\\" NATO's buildup. And, with Washington's first-strike related missile defenses in Romania and Poland and its superiority in conventional, high-tech and space weapons, we should be alarmed but not surprised by Moscow's increased reliance on nuclear weapons.  Remembering the consequences of the bullets fired by an assassin's gun in Sarajevo a century ago, we have reason to worry about what might happen if a frightened or overly aggressive U.S., Russian or Polish soldier, pushed beyond their limits, in anger or by accident, fires the anti-aircraft missile that brings down a U.S., NATO or another Russian warplane. As the trilateral European-Russian-U.S. Deep Cuts Commission concluded \\\"In the atmosphere of deep mutual mistrust, the increased intensity of potentially hostile military activities in close proximity - and particularly air force and naval activities in the Baltic and the Black Sea areas - may result in further dangerous military incidents which.... may lead to miscalculation and/or accidents and spin off in unintended ways.\\\"9 People are human. Accidents happen. Systems are built to respond - sometimes automatically.  An Imperial Alliance  NATO is an imperial alliance. Beyond the ostensible goal of containing the USSR, NATO has made it possible to integrate European governments, economies, militaries, technologies and societies into U.S. dominated systems. NATO has ensured U.S. access to military bases for interventions across the Greater Middle East and Africa. And, as Michael T. Glennon wrote, with the 1999 war against Serbia, the U.S. and NATO \\\"with little discussion and less fanfare ... effectively abandoned the old U.N. Charter rules that strictly limit international intervention in local conflicts...in favor of a vague new system that is much more\"}"
