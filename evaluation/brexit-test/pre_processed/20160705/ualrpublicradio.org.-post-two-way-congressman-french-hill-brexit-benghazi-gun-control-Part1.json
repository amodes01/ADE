KAUFFMAN: The United Kingdom is preparing to chart a new course, leaving the European Union, and conventional wisdom from many economists is this could lead to some trouble - certainly a disruption of a sort. What's your take?  HILL: Far be it for me to tell the British what to do with their election. I think we have to respect the outcome. I do think there will be short term ramifications of their decision that will be difficult for the British people.  I think it will affect small businesses who export to the 28 countries of the EU. I think it will affect the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland. It could have ramifications regulatory wise in the city of London from a financial point of view.  But these are things that can be worked through. In my view, America will still have the United Kingdom as a good trade partner and ally for economic and national security issues.  KAUFFMAN: The issue of trade between the UK and EU has spilled over into the American presidential race\\u2026.Donald Trump - your party's nominee - is using the opportunity to denounce the TransPacific Partnership, generally calling for more restrictions on international trade, including NAFTA. You voted for trade promotion authority, are you feeling any disconnect here with your presidential nominee?  HILL: Good question, Jacob. I did support trade promotion authority because that's how the Congress oversees the executive branch and how they can negotiate a trade deal. The trade promotion authority passed by Congress last year was the most strict oversight of the executive since trade promotion authority started back in the Depression era.  When it comes to trade, I think Mr. Trump argues that we should make sure we negotiate deals that will favor the United States and that in open markets, our exporters and participators are treated fairly. Hard to argue with that point of view.  For us here in Arkansas, trade is important. We have well over 50,000 jobs tied to trade in this state and a lot of exports go to Canada and Mexico - the two largest countries that Arkansas companies export to. This is an important topic that needs to be handled in the right way.  KAUFFMAN: Trump of course styles himself as a businessman. It's always at the center of his campaign - you too have spent decades in the business world, establishing and running a successful bank\\u2026what do you think of Trump's business acumen? Based on your businesses sensibilities does he strike you as a good deal maker?  HILL: Well, Donald Trump spent a lifetime in the New York real estate business. There is probably no more competitive, cut throat business environment than to be in New York Real estate so I am sure he's got quality negotiating skills. The key is that when it comes to thinking about public policy ideas, do you want to think about them form a business persons point of view - that is some common sense, the ability to cut through complexities and come up with a common sense solution, that leads to a faster economy. Certainly I have tried to do that when I have been in Congress. I have tried to bring those hands on business skills, negotiating skills, common sense skills and apply them to the positions I have to make in public policy.  KAUFFMAN: On the other end of the presidential field, Hillary Clinton has fallen under familiar scrutiny from your leadership in the U.S. House. After two\"}"
