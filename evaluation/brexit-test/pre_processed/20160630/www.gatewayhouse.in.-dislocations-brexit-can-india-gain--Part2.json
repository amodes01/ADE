These may now be forced to open additional offices in the Continent. There will be additional costs, but it is no longer a hardship since English is becoming the operating language of most multinational firms.  Then there is India's old friend Russia, which is likely to be less isolated in Europe as a result of the Brexit. Not surprisingly, Russia is the only major power that welcomed the referendum result. Moscow has been cornered by the eastward expansion of NATO and sanctions imposed by the EU after the annexation of the Crimea by Russia. However, it might be premature for Russia to celebrate because while the economic arm of this alliance - the EU - has stumbled, the military arm - the NATO - could draw ever closer in the face of this political and economic crisis. The upcoming NATO summit in Warsaw starting on 8 July will lay out NATO's future thrust[7].  With the UK out of the Union, Europe, especially Germany, can revert to a relationship determined by geoeconomics realities rather than Anglo-Saxon hostilities against Russia. A Russia that is under less pressure is strategically more valuable for India because it reduces the incentive for Moscow to compromise defence, nuclear power and space technology co-operation between the two countries. Specifically, it also lowers the appeal for a cash-strapped Moscow from playing junior partner of a cash-rich China since Beijing is becoming a bigger consumer of Russian gas exports than Europe. Now is the time for India to cement its relationship with Russia by overt gestures like further increasing its stake in Moscow's energy sector and by signing a major arms deal with it.  Finally, the important issue of trade. Apart from the need for the UK to negotiate individual bilateral Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) with the remaining 27 countries in the EU, Brexit also complicates the ongoing Transatlantic Trade & Investment Pact (TTIP) negotiations between the U.S. and the EU. The repudiation of the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) by the leading candidates for the U.S. Presidential election of 2016 - Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders - as well as the U.S. government's threat that the UK would be at the back of the queue for a separate trade agreement with it, can be an impetus for reviving the stalled World Trade Organisation, which is at least a global system, and bilateral FTA's.  India can, therefore, leverage this opening by speedily concluding an advantageous bilateral trade treaty with the UK, since commerce between the two is worth over $14 billion[8] in 2015-16 and India is among the top three investors in the UK in recent years.  It is also possible that Brexit could make the EU's negotiating stance more flexible, becoming an opportunity for India to seal the almost decade-old negotiations for the EU-India free trade deal. So far the EU has held the FTA hostage to India-Italy bilateral differences and insistence on duty cuts for its auto and wine exports to India. Conversely, the Indian government has reviewed existing FTAs and concluded that they need to be renegotiated because the country has gained little in terms of increased market access.  All said, if like the UK's Brexiteers who opted out of the EU, an angry and increasingly disillusioned American electorate endorse Donald J Trump's inward-looking Presidency in November, then Beijing will surely pounce on the opportunities that Brexit has spawned.
