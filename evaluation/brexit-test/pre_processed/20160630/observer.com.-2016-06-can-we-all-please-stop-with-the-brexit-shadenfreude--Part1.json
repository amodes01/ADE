Not only was a clear win for Leave entirely unexpected, but this was, I suspect, the first most Americans had heard about this thing called \\\"Brexit.\\\" Case in point: News of the vote had largely been absent from the front pages of US papers until last week. And suddenly, it was as if the sky was falling because of something that sounded vaguely like breakfast cereal.  Sign Up For Our Daily Newsletter Sign Up Thank you for signing up!

America's political climate is so badly riven with conflict it took only a moment to draw the familiar partisan battle lines. Thus an ugly wave of exaggeration and ridicule swept across the Atlantic. CNN called it \\\"The biggest step backwards since WWII\\\"; Vox said it was \\\"Trumpism, without Trump\\\" and all just \\\"fueled by irrational xenophobia.\\\" From the right, Breitbart cheered that it \\\"Signals the end of the New World Order\\\" and Trump himself held a press conference in Scotland claiming this was Britain \\\"Taking their country back\\\" (ignoring, it would seem, the awkward fact that Scotland voted Remain). Facebook and Twitter were flooded with posts from America either insulting Out voters as stupid or celebrating them as rebels. Here then was a vintage American export: the rhetoric America usually reserves only for domestic political enemies, packaged and shipped abroad.  Let us be clear: Brexit is neither a romantic Independence Day from a rabidly socialist EU, nor a mass uprising of racist British nationalism. Pretending it's either one, in an effort to vent partisan anger ahead of November, is both counter-productive and petty. Brexit was a protest against several problems distilled into a single yes/no choice.  For one thing, Leave voters are not proxies for Trump supporters. Britain's politics contain more divisions than America's; it's far less orderly. Britain has six major political parties, arranged loosely from Right to Left as UKIP, Conservatives, Liberal Democrats and Labour, and the more single-issue Scottish National Party and Green Party. Sure, right-wing UKIP supporters voted overwhelmingly to leave, but they are a small party, with support from just over 10% of Brits; Left-wing Labour, Britain's biggest party alongside Conservatives, each supported by over 30% of Brits, contributed as many votes to Leave as UKIP, with over a third of Labour supporters voting 'out'. Their leader, Jeremy Corbyn, is a well-known critic of the EU : he's said he's \\\"concerned about the way the European Union is increasingly operating as a free market across Europe: tearing up the social chapter, damaging the working class and workers in Europe\\\". Which is all to say that the vote wasn't neatly split along either philosophical or political lines.  To Corbyn, the EU prevents Britain from being socialist enough. He supported the Remain camp in the end, but he may as well have campaigned for Leave: his support was so tepid that fellow Labour party leaders are resigning their posts in protest and 172 voted against him in a no confidence vote Wednesday. Among conservatives, the leadership was split, with Boris Johnson officially leading the Leave campaign and Prime Minister David\"}"
