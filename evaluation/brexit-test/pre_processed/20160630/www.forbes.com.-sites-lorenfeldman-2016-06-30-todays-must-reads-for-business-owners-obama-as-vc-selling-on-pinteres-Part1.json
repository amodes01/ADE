In an effort to improve its lot, the big box giant announced the merger of its Arkansas and Silicon Valley tech teams earlier this year. The stats are dismal: Over the past two years, Walmart's digital growth has been on a steady downward trajectory, from 20 percent growth rates in 2014 down to 10 percent, 8 percent, and 7 percent in the past three quarters. That's way out of step with the rest of the retail sector. Target 's digital sales rose 23 percent in the first quarter of 2016.\\\"  Social Media  Pinterest has introduced some new shopping features: \\\"At bottom, the site sees itself more as a competitor to Google - a way to search, discover and ultimately buy.'Shopping with Pinterest is meant to be that bridge between getting inspiration and actually making it a part of your life,' Ben Silbermann, the chief executive, said at an event at the company's San Francisco headquarters on Tuesday. Among the features are buyable pins,' or buttons, in browsers that users can click to purchase items on the site, as well as a digital shopping bag that follows users from their desktops to their smartphones or tablets.  Facebook is changing its news feed to focus on friends and family -- not companies: \\\"The changes will affect all types of content posted by publishers, including links, videos, live videos and photos. Facebook said it expected a drop in reach and referral traffic for publishers whose audience comes primarily to content posted by the publisher's official Facebook page.

It will have less of an impact, however, if most of a publisher's traffic comes from individual users sharing and commenting on their stories and videos. As has long been the case, publisher content that your friends interact with will appear higher in the feed compared to posts shared directly by a publisher.\\\"  Silicon Valley  Sal Kahn is educating the children of Silicon Valley's elite at a real school with actual walls: \\\"His laboratory school is not-for-profit, like the virtual academy upstairs. But it is an exclusive, selective private school not at all like the Khan Academy slogan -- 'A Free World-Class Education For Anyone, Anywhere.' Actually, Khan's lab school slogan could be 'a world class education for $25,000 a year for lucky Silicon Valley elites.' Khan disputes that. He says the point is to boldly experiment with research-based instruction. And then share everything the lab school learns with educators everywhere. 'Teachers are super over-worked; even to have the space to think about re-engineering is hard,' he explains 'Then, to actually do it, what is the curriculum? Everybody talks about project-based learning, but what are those projects?'\\\"  Here's how the show \\\"Silicon Valley\\\" took a shot at Theranos: \\\"In the episode, main character and Pied Piper CEO Richard Hendricks is facing questions about his company and its user base, which, as it turns out, is partially fake. 'This is fraud,' Jared Dunn, head of business development at Pied Piper, tells Hendricks. Hendricks had a perfect response: \\\"Is it? Our platform does exactly what it says it does.
