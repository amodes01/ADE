One popular regulation British consumers could look forward to until now was the elimination of roaming charges across the EU. Ultimately, the EU is a massive common market of 500 million people (almost 200 million more than in the US), however Socialist individual countries might be, and Britain just cut off its unfettered access. That's not a vote for the free market: that's a vote against globalization with your nearest neighbors. American translation: Imagine if California pulled out of the United States, and now had to renegotiate all customs, tariffs and trade restrictions.  But the biggest issue with turning Brexit into a vicarious battle between America's Left and Right is this: it adds undue vitriol and anger at a time when Britain and Europe need unity and support. Britain faces an unprecedented leadership crisis ahead of its negotiations with Europe: Cameron has resigned, but it's unclear which conservative will replace him. Labour is in chaos. And there will be more than Brexit to negotiate: Northern Ireland is part of Britain, and borders the country of Ireland, which is part of the EU-a split from the EU will require border controls on the Irish border that has been largely informal since the end of Northern Ireland's bloody conflict in the 1990s. Scotland might push for its own referendum to break away from Britain and re-join the EU, shattering a 300-year old union.  And that's not all. European elites are poised to seek punishing terms for Britain, to set an example. They have already rejected the idea of any \\\"informal\\\" negotiations. In a masterful stroke of preterition, French President Francois Hollande had already threatened British voters ahead of the vote: \\\"I do not want to scare you but I just want to say the truth. There will be consequences in many areas.\\\" He was talking about France giving up its agreement on border protection in Calais, where refugees seeking access to Britain have set up camp at the French entrance to the Channel Tunnel. Angela Merkel is urging caution, saying negotiations cannot be rushed, but there are few signals this will be a friendly \\\"conscious uncoupling.\\\"  And in the middle of that chaos, we have Americans yelling at each other and pretending that this is a simple proxy battle in their domestic ideological war. This, of course, at a time when America's support would go a long way to nudging Britain and Europe towards better cooperation. There is already a determined movement trying to establish a rapprochement between Leave and Remain, to help get a better outcome for Britain and for the EU. So please, Americans, the British do not need your partisanship right now. Wish the parties well, hope for the best, and please, do not drag them into a pre-November brawl instead. This is one American export we can all do without.  Christine Nikol is a former management consultant with a background in politics and journalism.
