Impact on the U.S.  Companies in the U.S. across a wide variety of sectors have made large investments in the U.K. over many years. The U.S. hires a lot of Brits, making U.S. companies one of the U.K.'s largest job markets. The output of U.S. affiliates in the United Kingdom was $129.3 billion in 2021.  The United Kingdom plays a vital role in corporate America's global infrastructure, from assets under management (AUM) to international sales and research and development (R&D) advancements.  American companies have viewed Britain as a strategic gateway to other countries in the European Union. Brexit is believed to jeopardize the affiliate earnings and stock prices of many companies strategically aligned with the United Kingdom.  American companies and investors that have exposure to European banks and credit markets may be affected by credit risk. European banks may have to replace $123 billion in securities depending on how the exit unfolds. Furthermore, U.K. debt may not be included in European banks' emergency cash reserves, creating liquidity problems. European asset-backed securities have been in decline since 2008.  Who's Next to Leave the EU?  Political wrangling over the EU wasn't limited to Britain. Even following Britain's departure, most EU members had strong Euroskeptic movements that, while they struggled to win power at the national level, heavily influenced the tenor of national politics in the years that followed. There is still a chance that such movements could secure referendums on EU membership in a few countries at some point in the future.  In May 2016, global research firm Ipsos released a report showing that a majority of respondents in Italy and France believe their countries should hold a referendum on EU membership.  Italy  The fragile Italian banking sector has driven a wedge between the EU and the Italian government, which provided bailout funds to save mom-and-pop bondholders from being \\\"bailed in,\\\" as EU rules stipulate. The government abandoned its 2019 budget when the EU threatened it with sanctions. It lowered its planned budget deficit from 2.5% of GDP to 2.04%.  Matteo Salvini, the far-right head of Italy's Northern League and the country's deputy prime minister, called for a referendum on EU membership hours after the Brexit vote, saying, \\\"This vote was a slap in the face for all those who say that Europe is their own business and Italians do not have to meddle with that.\\\"  The Northern League has an ally in the populist Five Star Movement, whose founder, former comedian Beppe Grillo, called for a referendum on Italy's membership in the euro-though not the EU. The two parties formed a coalition government in 2018 and made Giuseppe Conte prime minister. Conte ruled out the possibility of \\\"Italexit\\\" in 2018 during the budget standoff.  France  Marine Le Pen, the leader of France's Euroskeptic National Front, hailed the Brexit vote as a win for nationalism and sovereignty across Europe: \\\"Like a lot of French people, I am very happy that the U.K. people held on and made the right choice. What we thought was impossible yesterday has now become possible.\\\" She lost the French presidential election to Emmanuel Macron in May 2017, gaining just 33.9% of votes. He won the election again in 2022, beating Le Pen once more.  Macron has warned that the demand for \\\"Frexit\\\" will grow if the EU does not see reforms. According to a 2020-2022 European Social Survey poll, 16% of French citizens want the country to leave the EU, down from 24.3% in a 2016-2017 poll.  When Did Britain\"}"
