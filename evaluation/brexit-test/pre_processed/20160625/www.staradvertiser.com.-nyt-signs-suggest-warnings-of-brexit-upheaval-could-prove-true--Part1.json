Lumineau said he would move to Paris from London and take about 10 employees at his financial startup with him.  The looming question Friday was how many other executives might reach the same conclusion, undermining Britain's status as the No. 1 destination in Europe for foreign investment.  Lumineau's reasoning was simple. His customers operate under European rules and so must he. \\\"We need to be inside,\\\" said Lumineau, the French chief executive of BrickVest, a company that allows customers to invest small sums in real estate online.  The long-term business consequences of Brexit will take years to fully emerge, largely because no one knows what kind of new trade barriers and regulations will emerge from negotiations with the European Union. But already there were worrisome signs that the \\\"remain\\\" camp's warnings of economic tumult could come true.  Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, warned his staff in a memo Friday that, in months to come, \\\"we may need to make changes to our European legal entity structure and the location of some roles.\\\" Dimon had said before the vote that up to a quarter of JPMorgan's 16,000 employees in Britain might need to relocate.  Shares of British property companies plunged Friday on fears that the Brexit vote will cause a recession and deflate London's real estate boom.  Do not miss out on what's happening!

Juergen Maier, the top executive in Britain of Siemens, the German electronics and engineering giant, said it might need to rethink its investment plans. He predicted others would do the same, at least until they can judge the impact of Brexit.  \\\"All companies will be holding fire to see what happens,\\\" Maier said.  For decades, big multinational companies have used Britain as their business-friendly, English-speaking beachhead to Europe. As a member of the European Union, Britain offered frictionless access to the mainland, while the legacy of Margaret Thatcher meant there was far less regulation than in France or Germany.  Now that the English Channel suddenly seems a lot wider, businesses are waiting nervously to see what kind of new Europe will take shape. Negotiations on a post-Brexit trade relationship are likely to be messy and take years. And in the meantime, Europe could be in for serious political instability as right-wing parties in France, Finland and other countries try to ride Britain's coattails out of the union.  It is not all bad for business. The plunging pound will help the tourism industry by making Britain a cheaper place to visit. BMW Mini automobiles and other products manufactured in Britain will be less expensive for people paying in euros and other foreign currencies. That could be good for exports.  Britain could also be free to follow its free market instincts without interference from Brussels. If the \\\"leave\\\" forces are correct, that would make the country a magnet for companies seeking to escape the regulatory corset of mainland Europe.  But any advantages are likely to be outweighed by the enormous uncertainties ahead. With no road map, executive decision-making could be paralyzed, and investment could come to a standstill.
