What was particularly startling were the positions leave voters were likely to have on an array of social issues.

Fury of the neglected towns  The vast majority of the north of England voted to leave. The north is home to towns and cities that were built around industries that have long since left. Cotton, steel and mining used to provide jobs in places such as Preston, Sheffield and Sunderland.  Now, there are not many jobs.

In the UK, the Leave campaign has achieved this. In the US, it's Trump's turn to try.\"}"
