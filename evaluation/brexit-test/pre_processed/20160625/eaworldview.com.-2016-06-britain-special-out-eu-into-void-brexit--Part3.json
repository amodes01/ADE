Once out, the UK would need to strike new trade deals with the EU and other countries. This could take many years.  At the same time, all national rules based on EU obligations will need to be catalogued. Should they be kept or replaced? If the UK wants continued access to the Single Market, it may decide to leave some of them in place. If it decides to replace any, what should the new rules say?  All this will place an enormous burden on the Government and Civil Service and provide much work for lawyers.  Sotirios Zartaloudis: Far-Right Populism  This result confirms what we have been witnessing in England over the last ten years, a steady rise of far-right extremism and populism. Using a \\\"scapegoat\\\" agenda and promoting the Euro-racism of \\\"the decent people\\\" - Nigel Farage's phrase - against \\\"Europeans\\\" in Brussels and in the UK, Britain becomes the first country to decide to leave the EU.  Parts of Britain have been out of Europe mentally for some years now. But the worst is yet to come. Brexiteers have a clear agenda of dismantling key aspects of employment law legislation, environmental protection, and other market-correcting regulations.  Today most British voters feel closer to the angry supporters of Donald Trump, where far-right populism is used strategically by rich elites who accuse foreigners and \\\"experts\\\" of being the key culprits responsible for increasing economic precariousness. One wonders if they will ever realize that this is a convenient excuse used by Westminster to shift the blame elsewhere.  This is an own-goal of historic proportions that gives pleasure to far-right populists around the world, such as Vladimir Putin and Marine LePen). It may signify the dismantling of the UK, given the strong pro-EU voting in Scotland, Northern Ireland, and London.  David Dunn: The Place of England-Wales in the World  Although foreign and security issues were not central to the referendum debate, the impact of Brexit may be momentous. Brexit has the potential to re-energize the Irish question and Scottish support for Europe presages a second independence referendum - one which has implications for the UK's nuclear status given that these forces are all based on the Clyde.  \\\"Taking back control\\\" of trade policy will also affect England's foreign policy. In seeking deals with China, the Middle East, and beyond, the Foreign Office will be less inclined to side with its major allies in criticizing these states when its bilateral trade access depends upon accommodation. This may create distance from Washington, Berlin, and Paris as London kowtows to Bejing and others for market access.  The biggest impact, however, will be on Europe itself. President Obama's support for Remain was premised on the idea that an outward looking, Atlanticist Europe was better for the world and more likely with the UK in it. Following Brexit, the forces of disintegration and xenophobia have been strengthened in Europe and the progress made over the last 70 years towards a tolerant, integrated, and liberal political community has been put at risk.  The consequences for the very nature of Europe have been raised by Brexit and go way beyond the uncertainty over what relations England-Wales will have with the continent and the rest of the world.\"}"
