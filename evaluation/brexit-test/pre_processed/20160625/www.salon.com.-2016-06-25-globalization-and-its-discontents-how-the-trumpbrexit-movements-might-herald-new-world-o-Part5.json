The thought of a dissolved or diminished NATO - which Trump has pushed - panics the Europeans and the Turks, as Russia loads up their border with troops; Trump's spurning of TPP rattles much of Asia, especially Singapore and Vietnam, nations heavily dependent on trade.  Our stalwart allies, Japan and the U.K., Trump publicly has excoriated as trade cheats and skewered as bastions of limp-wristed Euro-malaise, though the latter perhaps not so much anymore.  And what of his infamous wall?  In America, the views on admitting Syrian refugees and welcoming more illegal Mexicans come down to those who view immigration as culturally additive versus those who see such an influx as a dilutive hazard to Western culture and safety. For the former, their case is a simple one to make on humanitarian and religious grounds; although the embrace of dislocated peoples obscures the metadebate that should be taking place and occupying the political discourse. How did they become refugees, or why are they leaving in the first place?  That answer is obvious enough. Hearing it uttered in official circles, however, is like searching for the Loch Ness Monster. In April, I attended a gala for Refugees International, an honorable organization that raised quite a lot of money that evening. As Richard Branson spoke, I thought of the Russian novelist Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn. His 1978 commencement address at Harvard University is well-known and memorable for its takedown of the West, its ruling elite and media. \\\"The western world has lost its civil courage\\u2026such a decline is particularly noticeable among ruling groups and the intellectual elite\\u2026they have no determining influence on public life.\\\" That evening, there were many nice speeches, but I would have liked them all better had someone made reference to the genocides and economic waste and dictatorships and brutality and civil wars that had displaced so many in the first place.  The Brexit has dealt a big blow to the theories of integration - moral, economic and cultural - that have bound the world. Such notions of greater integration, in the aftermath, appear at risk by the so-called populism that pushed Britain to sever from the EU. In the U.S, it's hard to see a viable pathway for the Trans Pacific Partnership, even if it is an important thread that will draw countries closer. Trump represents an embrace of uncertainty, a certain asymmetry to predictable systems and policies, and that holds appeal among at least the 12 million Americans who voted for him.  If Trump and Brexit plunge us into the Eliotic realm of chaos and discord, these are the words from \\\"The Wasteland\\\" that now may make sense to us all: \\\"These fragments I have shored against my ruins.\\\"\"}"
