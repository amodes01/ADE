As if democracy is a tool for specific agenda.  The reaction to Brexit so far from the global liberal media, which is also disturbingly national-capital centric, has been quite similar to its response to the rise of Donald Trump in the US or the voting in of Narendra Modi.  This reaction is characterised by a denial of the new reality, followed by an intense hatred towards the masses, culminating into cynicism towards democracy itself.  Advertisement  To recall, when it became clear that Modi was in pole position to become India's Prime Minister, it was suggested that voters lack the intellectual wherewithal to understand the mistake they are committing.  \\\"Modi is dangerous to India, because he is the kind of model of Chinese authoritarianism presented in Indian dialects. That's the last kind of person we need for a confused and complex democracy such as India,\\\" a member of the academia was quoted in this 2013 interview. This statement was hardly a lone voice.  This attitude of talking down from a pulpit, a kind of I-know-what-is-best-for-you, has again been on display after United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union. An Indian English daily interpreted Brexit as: \\\"politics of fear, hate, lies, xenophobia and blaming the ' other', or in this case the ' outsider', for all troubles winning the day.\\\"  Advertisement  How ironic that this is a reflection of the very prejudice that liberalism professes to fight against!  If, for the sake of argument, we assume that right-wing populism is on the rise, it must point to an ever increasing dissatisfaction and insecurity. And if that is so, there must be a widening chasm between the leaders and the masses they represent. The gap between promise and delivery. Tied to these are questions of unequal growth, the market following its own logic, the influx of refugees, immigration and terrorism. All of these are pressure points that demand a complex evaluation.  Advertisement  Instead of even attempting to grasp why voters across the world are delivering stunning repudiations to the economic and political elites, liberals have resorted to painting entire populations across continents with a broad xenophobic brush.  Such tendencies have been seen in Europe, America, as well as in India. To marginalise and term millions as \\\"xenophobic\\\", \\\"racists\\\", \\\"haters\\\", \\\"liers\\\" \\\"fools\\\" when referendums do not throw up results liberals like is the defeat of liberalism.  Advertisement  Be it the Modi-led BJP winning an unprecedented mandate in India, Trump clinching the primaries, or voters from mainly disadvantaged parts of England choosing to 'leave', the overwhelming response is to suggest that the voters are not qualified enough to make such decisions. It is as if democracy is a tool for a specific agenda. It is to be lauded when results go one way and questioned when they take a different path.  Advertisement  The European Union is not just a single market, but is also a cultural idea-a sort of an elite institution that seeks to dilute boundaries and merge regional identities into one big European melting pot. And equally, it also divests the voters of the democratic power to control the fate of the countries they live in. They still have voting power to elect governments but that power amounts to very little when confronted with shared realities.
