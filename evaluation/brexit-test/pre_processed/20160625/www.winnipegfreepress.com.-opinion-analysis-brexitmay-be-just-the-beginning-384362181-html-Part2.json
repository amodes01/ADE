"{\"uid\": \"www.winnipegfreepress.com.-opinion-analysis-brexitmay-be-just-the-beginning-384362181-html-Part2\", \"text\": \"fact the country will probably lose duty-free access to the EU's \\\"single market.\\\"  Further down the road, more pain will follow, as jobs disappear abroad, the British economy goes into recession and the City of London starts to lose its status as a global financial centre rivalled only by New York. That will make domestic politics nasty enough, but the anti-immigrant fervour and outright racism that disfigured the \\\"Leave\\\" campaign are unlikely to dwindle in the ugly aftermath.  Scotland will vote to secede from the U.K., but it will face major legal and political barriers in its campaign to remain a member of the EU in its own right. Spain, in particular, will give it a hard time, as Madrid does not want to provide a precedent for Catalonia seceding from Spain and painlessly re-emerging as an independent EU member.  Northern Ireland will face an even harder time, as the Republic of Ireland will continue to be a EU member, and so it will have to re-establish border controls. One alternative would be for Northern Ireland (which voted in favour of staying in the EU) to unite with the Republic, but Northern Irish Protestants would still fiercely resist such a proposal, and in that context a revival of armed conflict is not unthinkable.  The triumph of Brexit is a most regrettable outcome for everybody involved and possibly even for the world economy. But perhaps it is not really all that shocking: Charles De Gaulle vetoed British entry to the Common Market, the EU's ancestor, for five years on the grounds it did not really have a \\\"European vocation.\\\"  Turns out he was right.  Gwynne Dyer is an independent journalist whose articles are  published in 45 countries.\"}"
