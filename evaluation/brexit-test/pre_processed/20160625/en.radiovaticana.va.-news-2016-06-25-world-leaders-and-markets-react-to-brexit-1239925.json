Populist leaders have now urged similar referendums in their own countries as the one that led to Britain's Brexit on Thursday.  Listen to Stefan Bos' report:      With the British pound declining and shares plunging in Europe, the United States and other markets, government leaders wonder who else may leave the European Union after Britain. If it's up to populist leaders, Brexit is the beginning of the unraveling of the EU.  Dutch firebrand politician Geert Wilders who leads the anti-Islam PVV party told Vatican Radio that he wants a similar 'Nexit' vote in the Netherlands. \\\"It's a historic day. The people of Britain have been teaching the elite in London and Brussels a lesson,\\\" he said.  \\\"They choose for an independent Britain that can take care of its own affairs, its own borders its own migration policy and money. And I hope and think that the Netherlands should do the same.\\\"  His comments worry governments in Eastern Europe as his party is leading in opinion polls in the Netherlands ahead of upcoming elections. Hungary, Czech Republic, Poland and Slovakia, known as the Visegrad Group view Brexit as a major loss for the EU.  EU subsidies  They are heavily dependent on billions of euros in EU subsidies and fear for the future of the many East Europeans working in Britain. Slovakia, which take over the EU's rotating presidency on July 1, has already urged Britain to say when it will leave in an effort to end the uncertainty.  Poland, the largest economy among East Europe's EU member states, is worried too. Poland's Foreign Minister Witold Waszczkowski said Brexit would lead to \\\"problems, problems for both Great Britain and for Poland. Problems, troubles, chaos, long chronic negotiations.\\\"  In Western Europe, French President Francois Hollande warned: \\\"The danger of extremism and populism is immense. It's always quicker to undo than to create. To destroy than to build. France, founding member of the EU, will not accept it.\\\"  The United States also expressed concern. And shock waves are felt in Brussels where the president of the European Council, Donald Tusk, tried to calm down his worried colleagues. \\\"I always remember what my father used to tell me: 'what does not kill you, makes you stronger'.\\\"  Yet for now the uncertainty continues over the future of the EU, once founded after World War Two to avoid new conflicts in Europe.  It also comes amid mounting East-West tensions over Russia's annexation of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula and its alleged support for pro-Russian separatists. However Russian President Vladimir Putin denied allegations that he had influenced the vote in Britain to leave the EU.\"}"
