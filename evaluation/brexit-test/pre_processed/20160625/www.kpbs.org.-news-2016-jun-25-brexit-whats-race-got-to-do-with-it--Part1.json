Global stocks tanked, and the British pound crashed to a 31-year low. World leaders from the U.S. to Japan to Germany spoke out about the far-reaching effects the referendum would have.  The scale of this reaction was predictable - after all, the U.K. joined the EU's predecessor, the EEC (European Economic Community), back in 1973 and has been one of its most influential members for decades. As the (now formerly!) fifth-largest economy in the world, even moderate changes in Britain's political stance affect global markets.  So why did the U.K. vote for something so politically and economically disruptive? Some say race has a lot to do with it - specifically, the racial tension that has resulted from the U.K.'s recently welcoming in record numbers of immigrants. In 2015, 630,000 foreign national migrants came to the U.K. from both inside and outside the EU. This year, the U.K. has ushered in an additional 333,000.  The campaign to get the U.K. to leave the EU (also known as the \\\"Leave\\\" campaign) was spearheaded by the right-wing, populist UK Independence Party, or UKIP. The party, led by Member in the European Parliament Nigel Farage, says that the EU \\\"means the end of the UK as an independent, self-governing nation with its own government and its own borders.\\\"  For months, UKIP has fought for the United Kingdom's independence from the EU - some say by capitalizing on racially charged animus toward immigrants. In the Washington Post, writer Anyusha Rose points to the Leave campaign as evidence that in the U.K., \\\"racism is no longer racism - it's legitimate opinion.\\\"  Areeq Chowdhury, a British writer and the founder of WebRoots Democracy, said last week that it's \\\"important we remember that this is a referendum that has only been made possible due to a long, hard-fought campaign by those on the far-right and political movements ridden with allegations of bigotry, xenophobia, and racism.\\\" He continues:  \\\"Nigel Farage - the UKIP leader who once said that his party 'would never win the nigger vote,' refers to Chinese takeaways as 'a chinky,' and said people would feel 'concerned' to live next to Romanians - is the man who should take a significant chunk of the credit for us having this referendum. It was his party's success in the European Parliament elections, as well as defections which he brokered from the Conservative Party, which has led us to this point today.\\\"  Zack Beauchamp over at Vox writes that the UKIP has spent the past 10 years \\\"focusing, obsessively, on the threat from immigrants, from both inside the EU and out.\\\"  That work seems to have been fruitful. Beauchamp says, \\\"Over the course of the past 20 years, the percentage of Britons ranking 'immigration/race relations' as among the country's most important issues has gone from near zero percent to about 45 percent. Seventy-seven percent of Brits today believe that immigration levels should be reduced.\\\"  Many politicians say anti-immigration sentiment should not necessarily be cast as racism - they argue that immigrants take jobs from native-born British citizens, that immigration drives down wages for everyone, and that the desire to keep jobs abundant and wages high is a goal that millions share, across racial and political lines.  And Timothy B. Lee, at Vox, argues\"}"
