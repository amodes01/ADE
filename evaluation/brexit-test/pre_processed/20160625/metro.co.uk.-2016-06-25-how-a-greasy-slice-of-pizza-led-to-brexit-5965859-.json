The EU referendum was the biggest event in politics for a generation, which makes it all the more surprising that the decision to hold it was decided over a slice of pizza.  David Cameron was on his way home from a Nato conference in the US in May 2012 when he met with Foreign Secretary William Hague to discuss plans for the 2015 British general election and ways to resolve the deepening fissure in the Conservative Party over the European Union.
