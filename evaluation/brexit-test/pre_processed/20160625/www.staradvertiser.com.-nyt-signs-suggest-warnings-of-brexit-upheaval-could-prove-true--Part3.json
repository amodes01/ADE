Last year the company produced about 475,000 vehicles, about a third of Britain's total, exporting about 55 percent of them to the European Union.  Yet despite the European Union's importance to local jobs, voters in Sunderland voted overwhelmingly to leave. The Brexit camp won 61 percent of the vote compared with 39 percent for remain. Stuart Boyd, a Nissan spokesman, said Friday that the company was not ready to comment on how it might respond.  Perhaps workers believed that Nissan sales would increase because of a weaker pound. But any stimulus to British exports from a devalued currency is likely to be offset by higher prices for imported goods. Britain has a trade deficit, so a weaker pound is on balance negative.  Another huge foreign manufacturer is Siemens, based in Munich, which has 13 factories and 14,000 workers in Britain making products like electric motors, gas turbines and trains. Siemens is not about to pull up stakes. But Maier, the Siemens chief for Britain, said the Brexit vote could force the company to recalculate some investment decisions.  For example, European Union grants help finance Siemens research and development projects in Britain in areas like self-driving cars. That financial support will disappear once Britain is out.  \\\"The question is more about future investment, future research and development,\\\" Maier said. \\\"That's hanging in the balance.\\\"  He embodies the strong ties between Britain and the mainland. Born in Germany, Maier has lived in Britain since he was 10, studied there, and speaks with a British accent. He said that there was a palpable sense of anxiety Friday morning when he visited a company office in Manchester that is used by engineers and customer service representatives.  \\\"It's usually a really buzzing office,\\\" Maier said. \\\"This morning it was definitely quiet. Customers were not calling. That's not a good sign. The country is just taking all of this in.\\\"  \\u00a9 2016 The New York Times Company\"}"
