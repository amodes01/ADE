Incidents such as the one that took place in Germany when 1000 drunk young men of Arab or North African appearance mugged many during New Year celebrations in Cologne and sexually assaulted around 80 women , raise uncomfortable questions that politicians are loathe to confront.

Brexit is that.\"}"
