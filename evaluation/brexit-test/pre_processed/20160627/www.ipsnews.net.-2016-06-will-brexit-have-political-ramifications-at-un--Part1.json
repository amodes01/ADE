UNITED NATIONS, Jun 27 2016 (IPS) - The much-ballyhooed British exit (Brexit) from the 28-member European Union (EU) is likely to have political ramifications at the United Nations - both in the short and the long term.  If Scotland and Northern Ireland eventually decide to break away, as expected in the not-too-distant future, the United Kingdom (UK), as it is formally known in the world body, may be reduced to a minority of one: a kingdom sans unity.  Still, will Brexit make any significant difference at the UN?  At first glance, the answer seems to be \\\"not much,\\\" James Paul, a former executive director of the New York-based Global Political Forum, told IPS.  After all, the UN is composed of nation states, he said, pointing out that the United Kingdom will continue, as before, to participate in its national capacity in all UN activities, most notably the Security Council where it is one of five key Permanent Members.  On closer examination, though, the impact will be very considerable, though it will be various across the world body, he noted.  \\\"The European Union has become a powerful force at the UN over the past five years and all EU member diplomats closely coordinate with one another, in intense daily rounds of meetings at the EU Mission.\\\"  Paul, who monitored the politics and inner workings of the UN for nearly 19 years from an office just across from the UN Secretariat, said: \\\"They hammer out common policy positions and strategize how to work together to achieve common goals.\\\"  He pointed out that the UK has been a lead player in this process, benefitting from the large EU delegation and the information networks that the EU member state delegations provide. But now no more.  \\\"The Brits, now in splendid isolation, will find their UN perch rather lonely,\\\" -- James Paul.    \\\"It will be out of the club, no longer a participant, a loner in the diplomatic process. Its diplomats, for all their well-known talent, will be hard pressed to sway UN policy debates when differences arise with the EU. The Brits, now in splendid isolation, will find their UN perch rather lonely,\\\" said Paul, a one-time chair of the NGO Working Group on the Security Council and editor of the Oxford Companion to the Politics of the World.  Along with Russia, France, China and the United States, the UK is a veto-wielding permanent member of the Security Council, the most powerful body in the Organisation.  Barbara Crossette, currently the UN correspondent for The Nation and former UN Bureau Chief of the New York Times, told IPS the \\\"little Englanders\\\" do not seem to have a problem with the UN, which indeed they might cling to, as proof that the country still matters.  Still, Britain was not always a \\\"united kingdom,\\\" she pointed out.  And the recent Scottish referendum (in 2014) while it did not back independence, reminded everyone that the issue is still always in the background.  As for Northern Ireland, she said, this might speed up a move to be united with the Irish Republic - or, much less likely, with Scotland. Both voted heavily against Brexit.  Crossette said UK has been a member of the Security Council from the creation of the UN, and survived the loss of most of its remaining colonies after World War II.  \\\"Yes, it has been a big player at the UN - with a good foreign service and record in training diplomats - and I do not see that changing, at least in the near future. After all, France remains in the P5 with far less global influence,\\\" said Crossette, who is a contributing editor\"}"
