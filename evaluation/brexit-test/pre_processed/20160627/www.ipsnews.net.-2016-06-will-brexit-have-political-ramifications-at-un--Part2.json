But that would take time,\\\" she predicted.  Jayantha Dhanapala, a former UN Under-Secretary-General for Disarmament Affairs, told IPS Chapter VIII of the Charter of the United Nations provides for Regional Arrangements, especially in the maintenance of international peace and security and the EU was thus included in all consultations with the UN Security Council.  \\\"This will go on with or without the UK in the EU although the UK role going it alone - perhaps minus Scotland and Northern Ireland at some future date - will be greatly diminished in influence,\\\" he noted.  A corresponding increase in the importance of UK membership in the Commonwealth, said Dhanapala, may compensate for this in an increasingly multipolar world.  Far more importantly however are the trends that Brexit signifies.  He said post World War II in the 1950s Jean Monnet and his European pioneers set a precedent for regional organisation and trans-national planning because of its economic rationale and were followed in other continents.  Today, under pressure from parish pump politics, many countries are turning inward to populism as a reaction to immigration issues, widening economic disparities and enforced austerity, argued Dhanapala, who serves as member of the Board of Sponsors of The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists and a governing board member of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI).  If right-wing extremism in politics spreads growing intolerance, tension and conflict will increase and fundamental UN values will be under threat imperiling international peace and security, the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and agreements reached on vital global issues like Climate Change.  \\\"It is an urgent challenge where the UN must show collective leadership without waiting for a new Secretary-General to be elected,\\\" said Dhanapala, who ran for the post of Secretary-General nine years ago when the current UN chief Ban Ki-moon was elected to office.  Paul told IPS in the Security Council the picture is somewhat different.  The UK acts on its own in the Council, as one of the five influential Permanent Members, not subjected to EU common policy positions. France does the same. Here continuity from pre-Brexit seems more the order of the day, he noted.  \\\"But in fact, the Brits will have to contend with some of the same policy isolation they will suffer in other fora. They will be drawn ever closer to their \\\"special relationship\\\" partner, the United States, and find that they are even less able than before to produce policy of their own and hence to justify their own Permanent seat.\\\"  He predicted the UK role in the Council may face an uncertain future.  \\\"We have to wonder what might happen if the Scots (as now seems likely) withdraw from the UK, declare their independence, and then join the EU. Might Northern Ireland (where the \\\"Remain\\\" vote was also strong) also take the same course? What then would become of the \\\"United Kingdom\\\" as a Permanent Member, having lost important components of its national territory and not insignificant\"}"
