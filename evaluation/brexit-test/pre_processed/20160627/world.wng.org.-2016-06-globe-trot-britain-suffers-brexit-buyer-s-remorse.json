That's one reason real is sinking in this week.  Conservative opinion in the U.S. remains divided.  Michael Barone suggests unaccountable EU bureaucrats fed the Brexit vote (and similar high voter turnout in November could fuel a Trump victory);  John Bolton says the United States has a profound interest in Brexit success;  Danielle Pletka warned Brexit will not improve security as long as the West pursues an incoherent strategy in Syria; and  Charles Krauthammer : \\\"I think those who revel in the recovery of the sovereignty of Great Britain could find that it does not exist in 10 years.\\\"  Garry Kasparov, increasingly one of my go-to foreign policy commentators, on Brexit as one more triumph of the demagogues:  \\\"All of this complacency and cowardice has shown how little our leaders care about the big picture, the long-term, and the future of Europe and the world. They have ignored that they are under real attack from political and religious extremists in their own countries, from radicals abroad, and from a wealthy dictator in Russia. This has left a vacuum to be filled by the demagogues, the hateful, the ignorant, the dream-sellers, and the jihadists. They have plans and they have purpose-and they are winning.\\\"  ANGOLA: Oh my, there is an explosion of yellow fever in Africa no one seems to be talking about.  CUBA's state-owned tourism company will take over Old Havana in \\\"one of the most brazen and underhanded measures ever taken by this military-run corporation,\\\" according to the historian of the City of Havana.  PERU: Respected economist Pedro Pablo Kuczynski-or P.P.K., as he's called-takes office in late July with a worldly pedigree rare in a region with a longstanding love for folksy populists and authoritarians.  TERRORISM: Not a day in April passed without a terror attack, leaving 858 killed from Peru to the Philippines.  UNITED STATES: An Oklahoma district court has rejected a suit filed by a Syrian convert to Christianity against a local church. He alleged the church endangered his life by publishing news of his baptism. The court upheld the church's view that the public dissemination is \\\"rooted in religious belief.\\\"\"}"
