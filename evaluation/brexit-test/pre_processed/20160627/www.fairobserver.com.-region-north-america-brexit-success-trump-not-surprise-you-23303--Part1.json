On June 23, the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union (EU) with the full effect of the economic, social and political ramifications of the decision still unknown. While the historic decision has disturbed and surprised many, the foundation for such a seismic change is squarely the product of profound social and cultural tensions-some of which are being simultaneously echoed by the United States.  Aside from the weight of the decision to leave the EU, the demographic breakdown of those who voted to leave-with a median age of over 65 years old-is notable. The bloc of voters vehemently behind the campaign for the UK to remain part of the EU had a median age of 21, according to British pollster YouGov. The discrepancy is both stark and important. Those who decided to leave the EU would ostensibly only have to \\\"live with the decision\\\" for 16 years, while those who fought to stay in will live with the ramifications for an average of 69 years.  Baby Boomers  The parallels to the US are hard to dismiss. The demographic that has supported Donald Trump, the candidate many initially wrote off as an impossibility, has now been carried to the position of the presumptive presidential nominee for the Republican Party. Reports have shown repeatedly that baby boomers are bolstering Trump's candidacy, the person to return them to their America-a time of greater economic stability and a more demographically homogeneous population. A 2015 Rasmussen poll showed that 56% of voters over the age of 40 want to build a wall along America's southern border, while only 36% of those aged between 18-39 support building the wall with Mexico.  Contextually, landmark events have changed the way that the US-and other Western democracies-have come to function. The events of September 11, 2001, and the subsequent War on Terror, as well as the economic down turn in 2008, have colored the way Americans regard both national security and economic stability.  The global economic crisis, combined with the rise of social media, has greatly contributed to the rise of far-right politics in the West manifesting itself in outcomes such as Brexit and the unprecedented rise of candidates such as Trump. The ability to connect exclusively with individuals and organizations that share ideologically-driven struggles and fears has exacerbated the impact of rising economic inequality, political extremism and xenophobia.  Trump himself, while visiting Scotland, made the linkage, tweeting that \\\"many people are equating Brexit, and what is going on in Great Britain, with what is happening in the U.S. People want their country back!\\\" This argument assumes that the countries have been taken away. It also assumes that the rise of immigration somehow works to unravel a nation's very fabric.  Coincidentally, Western democracies have been grappling with the so-called \\\"refugee crisis\\\" that has been born of the ongoing conflicts in the Middle East, but namely Syria. Though the US is well behind its goal to accept 10,000 refugees into the country by the end of 2016 (it has only accepted 1,285 thus far), the idea of granting asylum to refugees from Syria has only widened political divides.  The American right has argued that allowing in refugees from the Middle East will be a direct threat to US national security and stability, and has viewed all immigration policies with high scrutiny. The new perceived threat,\"}"
