"{\"uid\": \"www.christianpost.com.-news-eu-denying-europes-christian-roots-contributed-to-brexit-165713--Part2\", \"text\": \"\\\"A United Europe was my great-grandfather's dream,\\\" he said, as we had a friendly debate.  Jonathan, like his famous ancestor, has a broad vision. He is concerned for Britain's security in a world where Obama foreign policy has shredded overseas confidence in a friendship with the United States.  \\\"My great-grandfather would have voted 'Remain,'\\\" thinks Jonathan.  But I am not sure.  Churchill's vision was in the context of 1945 Europe. It was a continent struggling to rebuild after the Second World War. Europe in 1945 still remembered the First World War, when the august ruling monarchs, most blood-related, went at each other through the sacrifice of their young men. Churchill wanted a Europe that would live as a community, not an asteroid belt of colliding states.  Further, as Jonathan and I show in detail in God and Churchill, Sir Winston saw the Second World War as being for the survival of \\\"Christian Civilization,\\\" a term he used repeatedly. One doubts he would be excited about the rabid secularism of the current EU and its abandonment of \\\"Christian Civilization.\\\"  Jonathan and I, though disagreeing about the current vote, concur that Brexit contained important lessons. For one, he says, it revealed the weakness of the UK's leadership. Were Churchill in power now the vote would have never come up because he would have personally gone to Brussels and roared at the elites, confronted their errors, and demolished their authoritarian policies.  Jonathan and I believe the UK vote is a wake-up call for Britain and its leaders, as well as the United States. But the current situation is ominous. Hillary Clinton's foreign policy flaws, from the casual handling of secrets essential to national security, to failure to grasp what is really going on in certain situations, are painfully obvious right now. And what of Donald Trump's undeveloped, unproven, and vague, sometimes even confused, understanding of global issues?  Na\\u00efvet\\u00e9 about the world and disregard for its member states are the jagged edges of the iceberg sinking the EU \\\"Titanic.\\\" That, combined with the core problem of the rejection of God and the Judeo-Christian worldview, and the aloof arrogance and authoritarianism of the Brussels elite have caused the EU ship to not be seaworthy for the tempests roiling the globe.  That's why she may break up on those troubled waters, and why likely there will soon be a rush to the lifeboats.
