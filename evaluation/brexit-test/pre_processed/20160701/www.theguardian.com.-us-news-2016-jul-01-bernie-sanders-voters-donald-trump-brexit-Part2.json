John Bolger, a 26-year-old software developer from New York City, noted the similarities between Trump and the Brexit campaign. He wrote:  The Brexit shows that the establishment, and the establishment media that parrots it, is completely out of touch with the population they purport to represent. The unheard masses are rejecting the establishment in the only way the current system allows them to. For better or for worse, the Brexit is the product of years of establishment suppression, and it is a global phenomena that is far from over.  And while he did not personally support Trump, he noted: \\\"If Trump causes the White House to burn, it will be a stronger and wiser America that raises from the ashes, and so be it.\\\"  Only one respondent said watching the result of Brexit motivated him to back Clinton.    \\\"Brexit will impact my behavior in that I will give more money to Democrats down ballot, vote for Hillary, and I am considering making calls and canvassing for her if I have time, which might be unlikely,\\\" said Farzad Abdollahi, 39, who owns a manufacturer business.    He even hoped it would challenge Sanders voters who have switched to Trump. \\\"If anything, this will shake up the Bernie voters seeing what a disaster Brexit looks like it is going to be,\\\" added Abdollahi, from California. But from our informal poll, he was the only one flipped over to Team Clinton.\"}"
