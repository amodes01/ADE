In June 2014, oil sold at $115 per barrel; today it sells at less than $50.  (BBC (a), BBC (b), Al Jazeera, The Sunday Times, The Telegraph, Bloomberg)  4. England  At the end of the day, the Brexit vote was decided in England, which makes up 84 percent of the U.K.'s overall population of 64.1 million (Northern Ireland = 2.9 percent; Scotland = 8.3 percent, Wales = 4.8 percent). Both migration and control of finances are legitimate concerns, and longstanding ones for the U.K.-outgoing PM David Cameron even renegotiated the U.K.'s membership in the E.U. a few months ago to better address them. It was not enough to placate the English, who voted to Leave at 53.4 percent.  But outside London, England has numerous communities that have been propped up by EU funding and subsidies. Cornwall is a county of 500,000 people that depends on $80 million a year from Brussels, but 56 percent of the county voted to Leave. Like Wales, it was only the day after the vote that the head of Cornwall's Council scrambled to receive assurances-in writing this time-that Cornwall would continue to see this money. The U.K. could have survived Wales voting with its heart instead of its head; England in another matter.  (Office of National Statistics, BBC, The Washington Post)  5. London  Then there is London, an island of pro-European sentiment within an English sea of anti-E.U. anger. It's no surprise that 60 percent of Londoners voted to Remain. London makes up just 12.5 percent of the U.K.'s overall population, but it's responsible for 22 percent of the U.K.'s overall GDP thanks in no small part to its connections to the broader European economy. Also, London is home to 37 percent of those who live in the U.K. but were born abroad.  The real Brexit process, which will include negotiations with European leaders about the future U.K.-E.U. relationship, will not begin until the fall. But it's clear that Brexit has already given two constituencies with historical grievances more incentive to look beyond life in the U.K. Some decisions should be taken with the long game in mind. As we have just been reminded, that's a perspective that voters do not always bear in mind.  (BBC (a), BBC (b), House of Commons Library)\"}"
