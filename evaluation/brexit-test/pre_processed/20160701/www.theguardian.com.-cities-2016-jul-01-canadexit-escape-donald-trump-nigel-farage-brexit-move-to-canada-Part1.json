Were Tricky Dicky's revivified corpse to shamble on stage at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland later this month to demand the nomination, it would probably be hailed as an improvement. However, there was a time when decent Americans saw Nixon as an unprecedented threat to democracy.  One of those Americans was my grandfather. When Nixon was elected vice-president in 1952, my grandfather made good on that perennial threat of outraged American liberals throughout history: he loaded the family into the station wagon, drove up the coast from Orange County to Salmon Arm, British Columbia, and settled in Canada.    So it's in part thanks to Nixon that I now live and work in Toronto, having carried on the family tradition of making existential life decisions without thinking them through by using my Canadian passport to move from Australia. The Canada I moved to seven years ago was thought of as a pleasant backwater: cold, bland.  But Canada has become something very different. For one thing, Canada now has Drake, and a prime minister who can credibly claim to have had sex. For another, the US and the UK are voting their way toward national cosplays of Children of Men, and the less credulous among their populations are eyeing the exits.  Google searches for 'how do I move to Canada' spiked in the UK following the Brexit vote  Google searches for \\\"how do I move to Canada\\\" spiked in the UK following the Brexit vote, in inverse correlation to the value of the pound. Trump has already begun challenging his critics to make the move, perhaps anticipating the gulags (fabulous gulags, the best gulags) he will establish in our frozen north.  Though frequently cited as an empty threat, it's not unreasonable for Brits and Yanks anticipating a future transatlantic summit between God-Emperors Trump and Farage to contemplate a move to Canada. Many have come before.  View image in fullscreen ... run away! Photograph: AP  Our first wave of disgruntled immigrants crossed the Bering Land Bridge into North America some 40,000 years ago, although history does not record the identity of the neanderthal real estate tycoon they were fleeing. Their First Nations ancestors were later displaced by Americans, loyal to the British crown, who fled the Revolutionary War. During the 19th century, somewhere between 30,000 and 100,000 escaped slaves made their way to Canada on the Underground Railroad.    In the early 1900s they were followed in turn by the Doukhobors, a pacifist Russian sect who fled oppression in their homeland and resettled in the prairies of western Canada. Upon experiencing the reality of life in the prairies of western Canada, the Doukhobors regretted their decision, and devised a plan to return to Russia: they would force the Canadian government to repatriate them by stripping naked and setting fire to their own houses. Canadians are a patient people, but only to a point. The most devout of the Doukhoubors now live in Azerbaijan.  The next great wave of refugees arrived in the late 1960s and early 70s, when between 50,000 and 100,000 Americans chose to live in Canada rather than to fight in the Vietnam War. Deserters from America's subsequent wars continue to seek refuge here, as do Syrian refugees fleeing the consequences of those same wars.  So, how to move? And can it be done before Michael Gove and Donald Trump begin fumbling with launch codes in their sweaty fists?  It's not as easy as you might think. Americans with professional\"}"
