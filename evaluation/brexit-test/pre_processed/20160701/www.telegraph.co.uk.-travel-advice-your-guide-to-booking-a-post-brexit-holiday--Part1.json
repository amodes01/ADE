"{\"uid\": \"www.telegraph.co.uk.-travel-advice-your-guide-to-booking-a-post-brexit-holiday--Part1\", \"text\": \"The main short-term impact of the Brexit vote on travellers so far is the fall in the value of sterling. This has been very sharp, but, it seems to have stabilised at about \\u20ac1.20 to the pound. That is a lot lower than recent performance - the rate was over 1.35 at Christmas. But it is still higher than it was in the depths of the last recession between 2008-2012. So do not be too pessimistic. Costs on the ground in most destinations have effectively gone up by 10 per cent - not great, but not a complete disaster. We have seen this situation before, and it is still possible the euro may also weaken because of the political uncertainties on the Continent, too.  Read more: what Brexit could mean for travellers  A bigger issue from a cost point of view is the value of the pound against the US dollar, which at one point this week slumped to its lowest level since 1985. It has recovered some ground, though it remains weak. The problem here is not just for travellers who are planning to travel to the United States. Many countries - especially in the Caribbean - have currencies which are pegged to the US dollar or which use it as a parallel currency. Many travel services - like cruises or luxury safari lodges - are priced in US dollars. And, most importantly of all, so is oil, and this will put pressure on airfares, ferry fares and petrol price.  How soon will we feel the impact? Much depends on the performance of the pound. But some prices will be affected sooner than others. Obviously costs when you arrive in a destination, and anything you have booked in advance which was priced in a foreign currency, have already gone up. But, in the short term, the cost of anything you have booked or can book in sterling will be protected.  So, what can you do now to make the best of the situation, and, looking further ahead, what are the longer-term implications for travellers.  Short-term strategies  The pound has dropped against virtually all currencies since the vote. But according the FairFX, those where it is still higher than it was three years ago include: Norway (up 22 per cent) and Sweden (11 per cent); Australia and Canada (nine per cent) and Croatia (four per cent).  While staying in the UK for your holiday means you are protected from currency fluctuations, remember that many other people will be thinking the same. This summer, at least, there will probably be fewer good deals, and less availability than usual.  By contrast, you are much more likely to get a good-value late deal on a holiday in Europe. Package holidays priced in pounds are a particularly good option and the best place to find them is to look out for offers on tour operator websites. See our holiday bookings guides at telegraph.co.uk/tt-bookingguides for detailed guides and contacts for operators to all the key Mediterranean destinations.  Note, however, tour operators are legally allowed to surcharge, or increase the price of your holiday by up to 10 per cent even after you have booked if their costs increase because of factors such as currency fluctuations. Strict rules are in place: the provision for surcharging has to be stated in the booking conditions, no price increases can be imposed within 30 days of departure, and the operator has to absorb the first two per cent of any cost increases. You must be allowed a cancel option and be given a full refund if you do not want to pay the extra. Many big tour operators hedge their costs to avoid the need to surcharge. Inghams has just announced that it has frozen all its summer and winter holiday prices and ruled out surcharges. Abta lists all\"}"
