No change will come 'from within'. 'The wretched of the Earth' cannot count on the compassion, on kindness and the decency of the Western public, or on its solidarity. They will have to expose what is behind the 'civilized' mask of European culture - a horrible, gangrenous skull reflecting greed and a pathological lust for power. Then, 'the wretched of the Earth' would have to demand, in one united voice, what is truly theirs. Not beg, not ask politely, but demand! And eventually, they'd have to take it!  Whether the UK, one of the cradles of Western imperialism and colonialist bigotry, leaves or remains in the EU may have some influence on how the booty is to be divided 'internally', but not on much else.  Both sides of referendum, 'Exit' and 'Remain', gave their clear middle finger salute to the rest of the world. And it is really the right time for the world to return the courtesy.\"}"
