In other words, nuance questions like, \\\"How does Northumberland elected representative to the EU support our interests,\\\" would not surface to the top, she said.  Experts agreed that the way many news outlets used the Google Trends reports is not grounded in science.  \\\"The numbers shown to the public are processed in many ways and are meant to be very general trends only,\\\" Hearst said.  The claims that publications are making go too far, said Tom Davenport, the President's Distinguished Professor of Information Technology and Management at Babson College.  \\\"I might interpret the findings more positively,\\\" Davenport said. \\\"At least a lot of people have curiosity and are trying to learn more about the Brexit topic.\\\"  Our ruling  Like other media accounts, the Daily Mail headline said \\\"Google search spike suggests many people do not know why they voted for Brexit.\\\"  This is misleading. It's impossible to say if UK voters were the ones doing these searches, and the numbers of searches are hard to determine. Relative to searches for \\\"Brexit,\\\" searches about \\\"what is the EU\\\" were far less common.  We know people searched \\\"What is the EU\\\" and \\\"What will happen if we leave the EU,\\\" but we do not know why or how many. Point being, there is no evidence to fill those gaps.  We rate this claim Mostly False.\"}"
