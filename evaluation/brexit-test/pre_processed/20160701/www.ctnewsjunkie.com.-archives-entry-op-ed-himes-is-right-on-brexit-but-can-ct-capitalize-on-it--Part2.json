According to the Stamford Chamber of Commerce, \\\"Stamford is the biggest international trade center between New York and Boston.\\\"  UConn economist Fred Carstensen told Hearst that \\\"there are [European] managers that may well decide that the U.S. is a better place from which to operate, at least in the short run.\\\" But do not get your hopes up that they will flock to Connecticut.  \\\"Connecticut could capture some significant growth opportunities, if it were prepared,\\\" Carstensen said. \\\"But Connecticut is not well prepared. It is so consumed with the budget crisis that it is hard to find enough attention to make it more economically competitive.\\\"  Thank you, Fred, for cutting through the fog once again. Failure begets failure. And until Connecticut's leaders can find a way to make our state more competitive and attractive to new businesses, they will mostly stay away unless we bribe them with special deals. Perhaps Greenwich and other parts of Fairfield County want to exit the state. I know some hedge fund managers who would gladly vote for the Grexit.
