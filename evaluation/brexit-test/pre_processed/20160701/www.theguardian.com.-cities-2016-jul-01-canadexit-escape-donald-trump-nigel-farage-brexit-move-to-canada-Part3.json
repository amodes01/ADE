"{\"uid\": \"www.theguardian.com.-cities-2016-jul-01-canadexit-escape-donald-trump-nigel-farage-brexit-move-to-canada-Part3\", \"text\": \"largest city is now best-known for the antics of its late mayor, beloved domestic abuser and crack addict Rob Ford. His brief reign so ashamed Torontonians that they promptly elected a man so boring that his name is actually \\\"John Tory\\\", and whose soporific public persona might be particularly reassuring to Trump/Johnson refugees.  As for those of us already here, I think I am safe in saying that we are conflicted by Canada's status as a refuge for the politically dissatisfied. On one hand, we would prefer that control of the US and UK governments not fall into the hands of populist demagogues. On the other, periodic influxes of liberals are an electoral bulwark against their rise in our own country. On behalf of Canada, let me assure you that you are welcome here, but politely suggest that you consider standing and fighting.\"}"
