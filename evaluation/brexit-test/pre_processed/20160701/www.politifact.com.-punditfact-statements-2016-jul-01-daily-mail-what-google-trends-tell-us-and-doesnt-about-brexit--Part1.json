The evidence came from Google. News stories and Facebook posts pointed out that searches in the UK on basic questions like \\\"what is the EU?\\\" and \\\"what does it mean to leave the EU?\\\" spiked after the Brexit vote.  Daily Mail, a daily British tabloid, posted an article with the headline: \\\"Google search spike suggests many people do not know why they voted for Brexit.\\\" The paper pointed to a spike in the query \\\"what happens if we leave the EU,\\\" as evidence voters were unaware they voted to leave.  The Washington Post also posted an article on the trend implying that voters in the United Kingdom did not know exactly what they were voting for.

Here's why.  What Google Trends tells us (and does not)  Google Trends launched 10 years ago as a way to allow users to track the popularity of a search item in relation to an event. The search data categorizes searches into related groups and then measures the interest in a particular topic across searches from around the world, right down to cities.  For example, these were the top five questions in the United Kingdom on Google Trends after the Brexit vote on June 23. The queries represent the most-searched items relating to the European Union.  What Google Trends does not tell us is who is actually doing the searching. So there is no way to tell if the searches were done by Brexit voters.  Another issue is the significance of the searches in comparison to other factors. A 250 percent spike does not mean much if not many people were searching \\\"what happens if we leave the EU?\\\" prior to the report.  The number of searches before the vote is hard to determine  \\\"The problem with Google Trends is that it's essentially a black box,\\\" said Pete Meyers, a marketing scientist at Moz which sells marketing analytics software subscriptions. \\\"There is a lot we do not know about what goes into the number, and everything is relative.\\\"  For instance, when you look at \\\"What is the EU,\\\" on Google Trends, you see a spike. But when you add the term \\\"Brexit\\\" to the same graph the spike seems far less severe, he said. Although the raw totals of searches are not shown, the Trends data shows searches for \\\"Brexit\\\" were much higher than \\\"What is the EU?\\\" on June 24, the day after the vote.  Google Trends looks at a random sample of all searches, so you do not see the total number of specific searches. The numbers on the chart represent a probability of how highly searched a query is, ranked from 1 to 100. This allows Google to compare two terms against one another.  The volume of searches can be a self-fulfilling prophecy, Meyers said.  \\\"If Google reports that a lot of people are searching for 'What is the EU?' and then the press picks it up, curiosity leads people to run similar searches to see what the fuss is about,\\\" Meyers said.  He said he can not prove that's what happened here, but it has happened in the past.  Another major flaw in using Google Trends to make bold pronouncements like the Daily Mail is that the most common way to search something is\"}"
