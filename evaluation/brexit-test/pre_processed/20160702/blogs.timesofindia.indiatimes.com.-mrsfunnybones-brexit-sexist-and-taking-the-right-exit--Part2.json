Mr Swamy then, according to unreliable sources, closely watched Ruby Rai, the 12th standard humanities topper from Bihar who got arrested after a TV interview where she said political science, a subject she aced, teaches cooking! In the re-exam where she was asked to write an essay on Tulsidas, she decided to respectfully write down the only thing she knew, 'Tulsidasji, Pranam.' Ruby Rai later confessed that it was all her father's fault; she had merely asked him to bribe and make her pass the exams but Daddyji had made her a topper instead.  Mr Swamy quickly added up 4+2 and came up with Char Sau Bees and declared that in Mr Arvind Kejriwal's case also it was his Daddyji who was responsible for his admission into IIT, a ploy to harass Mr Kejriwal on different issues till he too makes a hasty exit from his post.  Mr Swamy is a relentless warrior, who randomly slings disconnected weapons around in a wide arc, hoping that at least one of his rocks will land on someone, anyone's head.  I would not be surprised if Mr Swamy now blames Brexit on Vijay Mallya's settling down in England a few months ago, by tweeting to his 2.8 million followers, 'Midas touched anything and it turned to gold, Mallya touches anything and it folds #Brexit'.

Walking down Fifth Avenue, I pass Trump Tower and see a crowd holding up signs, 'Vote for Trump, He is the savior and Hillary is a cheat!'  When I get home and tell the man of the house, he shows me a WhatsApp forward: 'US and UK are in a competition as to who is Dumb and who is Dumber, UK is in the lead but fear not the US has a Trump card.'  I begin giggling and like most Indians who deep down have always felt a bit intimidated by the Brits and the Yanks, as we grapple with their language trying to make it our own, I am secretly relieved.  It is finally apparent that those with the impeccable clipped accents or suave drawls are not so sagacious after all, and perhaps this clear display is enough for us Indians to make a hasty exit from our age-old inferiority complex as well.
