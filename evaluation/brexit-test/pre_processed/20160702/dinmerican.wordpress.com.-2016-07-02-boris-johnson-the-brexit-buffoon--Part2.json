He even got away with an extraordinary degree of flip-flopping on Brexit: from \\\"finely balanced\\\" in February to all-out in April to his latest, post-referendum column for The Daily Telegraph, in which he assured readers that \\\"Britain is part of Europe, and always will be.\\\"  Recklessness does not get near it. On Thursday morning, after destroying the political career of his old school chum Mr. Cameron, wrecking the British economy and possibly breaking up Britain, Mr. Johnson announced that he would not be sticking around to clean up the mess he'd made. His erstwhile ally, Mr. Gove, delivered the coup de gr\\u00e2ce as he announced his own candidacy for the Conservative leadership: \\\"Boris cannot provide the leadership or build the team for the task ahead.\\\"  Until yesterday, Mr. Johnson seemed to have an ability to outrun boring facts and bad publicity only surpassed, perhaps, by one Donald J. Trump. Boris will not be Britain's prime minister any time soon, and probably never, so what next?  A break from British politics seems like a good idea. Although he gave up his American passport to avoid paying taxes, Mr. Johnson was actually born in New York City. Perhaps Mr. Trump would take him on as a warm-up act - or even a running mate.  *D. D.
