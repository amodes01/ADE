Hollande is taking a diametrically opposite path, investing his shrinking political capital in Brussels. While acknowledging the EU needs reforming, he's rejected calls for a French referendum, saying next year's election will serve that purpose.  \\\"The British example will then be an example - or rather a counterexample,\\\" he told local media.  Indeed, some believe that Brexit's chaotic fallout may offer Hollande an opportunity to revamp his sagging fortunes.  \\\"Mr. Hollande tries to use 'Brexit' to rebound in Brussels and Paris,\\\" Le Monde newspaper wrote, citing a French minister describing presidential hopes to \\\"carry the people's aspirations ... of a different Europe.\\\"  \\\"Francois Hollande's popularity is very weak, the economic recovery is not good, and the left is divided. So he badly needed something to happen - and now we have Brexit,\\\" analyst Cautres said.  Hollande is hoping to capitalize on Brexit fallout and reignite the German-Franco alliance Image: picture alliance/abaca  Surveys also show that the French still tip toward membership - at least for now. A recent TNS Sofres-Onepoint poll found that 45 percent backed remaining part of the EU, while another third supported leaving. Another 22 percent were undecided.  Bread-and-butter issues  \\\"Especially if we continue to see this terrible economic data and all the internal infighting in the UK, the French may think twice before voting for a Frexit,\\\" said Marco Incerti, spokesman for the Center for European Policy Studies, a Brussels-based think tank.  But opting for a safe choice does not necessarily mean a vote for Hollande.  Incerti, for one, is betting on a win by former Prime Minister Alain Juppe, a center-right politician who has ruled out a British-style referendum but still wants a massive rethink of the European project.  Cautres agrees that Hollande's EU positioning is unlikely to pay off. Ultimately, he says, the French election will turn on bread-and-butter issues like jobs and the economy.  \\\"Francois Hollande is probably going to play on the same things he did during the last election,\\\" Cautres said. \\\"He's going to call for renegotiating Europe, reorienting Europe. But I have big doubts it's going to work a second time.\\\"\"}"
