"{\"uid\": \"www.independent.co.uk.-voices-confused-about-which-way-to-vote-take-a-look-at-the-facts-brexiteers-promised-you-then-never-Part5\", \"text\": \"will remain \\\"open\\\" under Brexit - but it cannot if they want \\\"to control our borders\\\". Ryanair Flight 8012 from Nowy Dwor Mazowiecki Airport (near Warsaw) to Dublin would become extremely popular, as would the Translink bus services from Dublin Airport to Belfast from where the passengers would fly to the UK unless border controls were also in place in Belfast.  The Brexit campaign has tried to get us to see immigration and sovereignty as powerful \\\"take control\\\" reasons to leave. The control logic is illusory and completely ignores the knock-on consequences to the economy. In reality, the Brexit campaign knows there are significant risks to the UK economy if we exit the EU. They have tried to dramatise the cost of membership by using a dishonest statistic of a weekly outflow of \\u00a3350m while ignoring all the direct and indirect inflows. The true figure is closer to \\u00a3120m per week - or 26p per person per day, half the price of a Mars bar. This represents 0.5 per cent of GDP and would of course be wiped out by a 0.5 per cent reduction in GDP as a result of Brexit.  The Remain campaign got it wrong by publishing Brexit forecasts that gave the Leave campaign the ammunition to accuse them of scaremongering and hence diverted discussion from the case for staying in the EU; the Leave campaign has failed to substantiate the case for Brexit. Their campaign has been emotive but it does not stand up to proper scrutiny. If there is no demonstrable advantage, why would I take such an enormous risk when such an extremely small economic downside can completely wipe out the \\u00a3120m per week cost saving?  And finally, a plea to anyone (like me) aged 70 or over: however, you choose to vote, do so for your children and grandchildren. Ignore your rear view mirror vision for the UK and vote for their future.\"}"
