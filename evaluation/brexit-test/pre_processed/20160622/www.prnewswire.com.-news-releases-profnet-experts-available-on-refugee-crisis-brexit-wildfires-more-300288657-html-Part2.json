Automakers need to show more urgency when dangerous defects become apparent. Says Ball: \\\"What we see over and over again in these situations is that automakers are aware of product defects, but they alert consumers only after injuries mount and regulators finally step in to force a recall. Once recalls are issued, these global corporations show a shameful lack of urgency in making sure vehicle owners are aware of the dangers. While investigators are calling this a 'tragic accident,' it's clear that Jeep should be doing a much better job warning motorists of the potential problems that could cause their vehicles to roll away like this.\\\"  Contact: Robert Tharp, [email protected]  Drought-Related Fire Hazard and Environment Impact/Issues  Timothy Krantz  Professor, Environmental Studies  University of Redlands  \\\"One has a situation where the past decade of average or below-average precipitation has resulted in a cumulative fire risk. In our mountains, poor forest lands management in our urban forest communities, such as Big Bear, Running Springs and Lake Arrowhead (building foundations within drip lines or right up to the trunks, trees growing through decks, paving over treed areas, etc.), has weakened trees and caused an exacerbation of bark beetle populations even in average rainfall years. The trees' natural means of expelling bark beetles is to pump sap, literally blocking the beetles in their bore holes. With the drought, the trees can not produce enough sap and the bark beetle populations have exploded from the urban forest areas out into the natural forestlands, devastating some areas with high numbers of tree mortalities. These standing dead trees are like match sticks, waiting for a spark or lightning strike.\\\"  Website: http://www.redlands.edu  Contact: Jennifer Dobbs, [email protected]  Causes of Wildfires and Environmental Impacts of Drought  Wendy McIntyre  Professor, Environmental Studies  University of Redlands  \\\"The drought is the most important reason that fire season is growing each year. Weather does play a role, especially when rain or snow changes the susceptibility of ecosystems to fire, and how the rain or snow falls -- i.e., do we get rains in huge downpours (which mostly runs off) or in slower steady showers that can soak into the ground and be available to plants to keep them growing and less fire-prone.\\\"  Website: http://www.redlands.edu  Contact: Jennifer Dobbs, [email protected]  Deaf-Blind Awareness Week Begins June 26  Beth Kennedy  Director of DeafBlind Central  Central Michigan University  \\\"Deafblindness is a disability of access. An intervener works one-on-one with a child who is deafblind to provide access and support. They foster growth within the student, assist them in making social connections and help them access the curriculum. They are a bridge between the student and teacher.\\\"  Kennedy developed CMU's new online Deafblind Intervener Certificate Program. She is available to discuss deafblindness, working with deafblind children and the training of deafblind interveners -- professionals who improve educational outcomes for those who are deafblind. She is an expert in working with deafblind children, helping to provide access, foster communication growth and help the student reach their potential. CMU offers only one of only two deafblind intervener programs in the nation.  Website:\"}"
