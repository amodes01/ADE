We all know what this could mean for the economy, immigration, jobs, fishing and even VISA-free travel, but what does Brexit mean for technology?  Tech is big business for the United Kingdom. The UK's IT industry is worth \\u00a358 billion to the economy annually. London-based tech firms alone raised \\u00a31.09 billion in venture capital last year. There are 42.4 million smartphone users in the UK, and that's steadily rising. We are the world's fifth biggest economy, and technology and science make up a big part of that.  Leaving the EU will have consequences for every sector, and technology is no exception. No one can say for certain what will happen when (presumably) leave, however Norway - who chose not to enter the EU in 1994 and was often cited as an example by pro-Brexit campaigners - delivered a warning that being alone is not all fun and games.  Of course the politicians can be wrong, the experts can be wrong, and the business leaders can be wrong - this is new territory. They can also be right, and some of the world's most influential technologists have been quite vocal about the EU referendum.

When it comes to Brexit, it's important to get a view of what our country's biggest technology business leaders believe will happen. It's their livelihoods on the line, after all.  It's no surprise that the Remain camp has garnered the lion's share of support from big business. The majority of UK exports to the EU, across both services and manufacturing, can largely (though not exclusively) be sourced to the major corporations.  Some of the key tech players throwing their lot in with Remain include: Bill Gates (Founder of Microsoft), Richard Branson (Founder of Virgin), Stephen Hawking (Award-winning physicist), Stephen Fry (Actor and technology columnist), Dr Ian Robertson (Board member at BMW, Gavin Patterson (CEO of BT), Martha Lane Fox (Founder of Lastminute.com), Dido Harding (CEO of TalkTalk), Ronan Dunne (CEO of Telefonica O2 UK), David Stokes (CEO of IBM), and Tim Berners-Lee (inventor of the World Wide Web).  Here's Richard Branson talking about his fears for Brexit:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1u8iMKml8xI  Bill Gates said that a post-Brexit Britain would be a \\\"significantly less attractive place to do business and invest\\\". He added:  \\\"While ultimately a matter for the British people to decide, it is clear to me that if Britain chooses to be outside of Europe\\u2026it will be harder to find and recruit the best talent from across the continent; talent which, in turn, creates jobs for people in the UK.\\\"  And Chris Kenyon, the Senior Vice President at Canonical - the British minds behind the Ubuntu operating system - said:  \\\"Canonical supports the Remain campaign, and believes the UK will fare better, socially and economically, inside the European Union. Employment conditions, safety standards, scientific advancement and economic vibrancy all improve with access to larger pools of talent and customers.\\\"  Microsoft founder Bill Gates supports the Remain campaign  Kenyon added that the UK has a \\\"special deal\\\" with Europe, that is \\\"a better deal than any other country will ever obtain, or that the UK could ever attain again\\\".  The technology industry's Leave camp is a little smaller, granted. Nevertheless, important industry leaders have spoken out\"}"
