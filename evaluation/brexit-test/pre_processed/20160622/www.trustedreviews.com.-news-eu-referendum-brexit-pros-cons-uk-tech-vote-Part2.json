Here's Julian Assange talking about why he believes in Brexit:  Speaking to the Daily Telegraph, Sir James Dyson said that the UK would \\\"create more wealth and more jobs by being outside the EU than we will within it\\\".  \\\"When the Remain campaign tells us no-one will trade with us if we leave the EU, sorry, it's absolute cobblers. Our trade imbalance with Europe is running at \\u00a39 billion a month and rising. If this trend continues, that is \\u00a3100 billion a year.\\\"  Related: EU Roaming Charges  What are tech start-ups saying?  So we have heard from big business, but there is more to the UK economy that giant corporations. What does the UK's booming tech start-up sector have to say about the prospect of Brexit?  Well, it seems that the vast majority of start-ups are keen to stay in the EU. A recent study by Coadec found that 81% of people in the digital start-up sector are hoping for a Remain vote. The sample size was 175, including 126 start-up founders, 26 start-up employees, 19 investors, and four others.  The study revealed that the key issues for the Remainers were:  Access to a large single market, with harmonised regulations  Free movement of labour, giving access to a talented workforce  Having a 'seat at the table'  Stability and security  The key issues for Leavers, meanwhile, were:  Sovereignty  Over-regulation and red tape  \\\"These results are not surprising,\\\" explains Coadec in its survey analysis. \\\"The UK's start-up community is international in its outlook and in its composition. Founders come to the UK from across Europe (and the world) to launch and grow their businesses. They look to Europe for talented staff to help them grow. And they aim to sell and expand across a trading block of 500 million consumers.\\\"  The Coadec survey is not alone in its findings, either. A survey from Tech London Advocates found 87% of start-ups wanted to remain, while research by techUK found that 71% wanted to remain in a reformed EU.  In fact, a Brexit vote could be felt very acutely by many of the UK's tech start-ups. That's because of the uncertainty over immigration legislation and the possible loss of free movement of labour.  Robert Newry, who founded technology recruitment service Arctic Shores, believes that the current interest in UK start-ups will \\\"dry up\\\" if we leave the EU:  \\\" We currently have 14 employees, four are European, three of whom are first-generation . We need multi-lingual staff and we can not find all the expertise we need from within the UK. Brexit would cause us not just hiring issues, but contract and revenue ones too.\\\"  Today, Britain's EU membership guarantees free movement of people. But if we leave, there is a chance that the UK could place new restrictions on who can enter and leave the UK. However, if the UK negotiates access to the single market post-Brexit, it's highly likely we'd have to accept free movement of labour as a caveat anyway.  Alex Hemsley, who co-founded Global M, an international technology recruitment start-up based in London, said that being in the EU makes it much easier to hire people in the tech sector:  \\\"The great thing about being a member of the EU when it comes to hiring is that the search for talent is not constrained by borders or hindered by red tape and therefore startups are free to concentrate on sourcing the best talent quickly and efficiently to\"}"
