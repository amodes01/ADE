In front of a crowd of 6,000, three Remain debaters - London Mayor Sadiq Khan, Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson, and General Secretary of the Trades Union Congress Frances O'Grady - faced off against Vote Leave's Boris Johnson, Minister of State for Energy Andrea Leadsom, and Labour MP Gisela Stuart. The televised debate was moderated by the BBC's David Dimbleby.  The referendum campaign has been marked by a new civility following the assassination of MP Jo Cox last week, but you might not have guessed it from the tenor of the debate. The Remain side wasted no time in attacking the allegedly misleading campaign materials and claims of their opponents. Khan held up a Vote Leave leaflet that suggested Iraq and Syria would soon share the same border with the E.U. Addressing his predecessor Boris Johnson, he said: \\\"Your campaign has not been Project Fear, it's been Project Hate as far as immigration is concerned.\\\"  Read more: Brexit: Should They Stay or Should They Go?  When Johnson called the E.U. a \\\"job destroying engine,\\\" Davidson launched a strong attack against her fellow Conservative Party member - and potential leadership rival - saying: \\\"You are going to be asked to vote in two days time and all you have heard tonight is 'trust us and it will all be fine' and that's not good enough\\\" she said. \\\"They [Vote Leave] will not tell us how much the economy will be hit by, they will not tell us how many jobs might go, they will not tell us what they will replace the single market with.\\\"  While audience members TIME spoke to said they were most excited to see Khan and Johnson in action, it was Scotland's Davidson who stole some of the limelight. She won applause by angrily lambasting the opposite side's call to \\\"take back control\\\" of the the country's borders, by withdrawing from free movement rules that have seen up to 3 million Europeans settle in the U.K. \\\"You lose control by losing your seat at the table,\\\" Davidson responded.  But the blonde-haired former mayor wrapped-up the event on a high. In rousing ending remarks, Johnson declared that Vote Leave was the side of \\\"hope\\\" and June 23 could become Britain's \\\"Independence Day.\\\" Speaking after the debate, Remain audience member Jason Tay, 23, conceded that Vote Leave had received the audience's most enthusiastic response, which he credits to Johnson's \\\"natural charm.\\\" \\\"I personally believe Remain had more substance\\\" said Tay. \\\"But, it was Boris's speech that got a standing ovation.\\\"  Naturally, both campaigns claimed a win. \\\"The in campaign had nothing positive to contribute tonight\\\" Vote Leave spokesperson Matthew Elliott told reporters afterwards. \\\"Just like they have failed to make a positive contribution to the whole campaign.\\\" Director of Britain Stronger In Will Straw said the leave campaign \\\"blew their last chance\\\" to give a credible plan for Britain's future.
