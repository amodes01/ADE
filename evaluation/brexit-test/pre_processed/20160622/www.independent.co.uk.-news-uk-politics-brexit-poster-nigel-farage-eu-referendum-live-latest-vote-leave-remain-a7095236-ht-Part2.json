So until 23 June we we are running a series of question and answer features that explain the most important issues in a detailed, dispassionate way to help inform your decision.  What is Brexit and why are we having an EU referendum?  Does the UK need to take more control of its sovereignty?  Could the UK media swing the EU referendum one way or another?  Will the UK benefit from being released from EU laws?  Will we gain or lose rights by leaving the European Union?  Will Brexit mean that Europeans have to leave the UK?  Will leaving the EU lead to the break-up of the UK?  What will happen to immigration if there is Brexit?  Will Brexit make the UK more or less safe?  Will the UK benefit from being released from EU laws?  Will leaving the EU save taxpayers money and mean more money for the NHS?  What will Brexit mean for British tourists booking holidays in the EU?  Will Brexit help or damage the environment?  Will Brexit mean that Europeans have to leave the UK?  What will Brexit mean for British expats in Europe?\"}"
