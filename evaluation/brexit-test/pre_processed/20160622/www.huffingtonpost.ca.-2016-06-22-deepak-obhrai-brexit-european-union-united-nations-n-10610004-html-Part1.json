Calgary Forest Lawn MP Deepak Obhrai, the parliamentary secretary for foreign affairs from 2006 to 2015, laid the blame for the Tories' embarrassing lost at the UN firmly at the foot of the EU Tuesday.

Despite the fact that we were a larger donor than Portugal, but the European Union controlled it,\\\" he told The Huffington Post Canada.

Germany was considered a shoo-in and won the necessary two-thirds of support on the first ballot, but Portugal surprised Canadian officials by coming in second, and increasing its support by a large margin during the second round of voting, after which Canada pulled out to avoid a further embarrassment.

The EU also used the colonies of some of its member states to lobby for support, he said, pointing to Brazil's campaign for the motherland.  \\\"You see the huge control of this bloc? That is threatening our interests,\\\" Obhrai said.  \\\"Britain's exit from the EU will help small countries like Canada.\\\"  A referendum will be held Thursday to determine if Britain should remain part of the EU.  \\\"Britain's exit from the EU will help small countries like Canada.\\\" - Conservative MP Deepak Obhrai  Obhrai dismissed suggestions Canada had lost because of its pro-Israel voting record, and cuts to the development aid budget that affected African countries in particular.  \\\"No,\\\" he said firmly. \\\"I campaigned\\u2026 We were giving money to Africa and everywhere, through multilateral institutions and we had countries of focus.\\\"  Perhaps, the Arab states did not appreciated the country's support for Israel, but they were only one bloc, Obhrai said.

Paul Heinbecker, Canada's ambassador to the UN from 2000 to 2003, told the CBC after the vote that the Conservatives' foreign policy - from decreasing African aid, to staunchly supporting Israel, to a lack of engagement on climate change and peacekeeping operations - had been unpopular with the international community.  Yves Fortier, another ex-ambassador to the UN from 1988 to 1991, told The Globe and Mail that the \\\"lamentable result\\\" was \\\"a reflection of things that Canada has done or not done that a majority of nations\\\" disapprove of.  \\\"It can only be interpreted as a slight to Canada by the international community,\\\" Fortier told the Globe.  'EU dimension can be overcome'  One diplomat posted at the Permanent Mission of Canada to the United Nations during the Security Council campaign noted that there is \\\"certainly huge pressure\\\" from EU members to vote for one another and to use their influence to get third countries to vote for EU members.
