Research from Broadband Genie recently revealed that 74% of Brits think it's important for the government to negotiate a deal to eliminate European roaming charges in the event of a Brexit.  European Union has scrapped roaming charges across EU (Coming 2017)  Rob Hilborn, Head of Strategy at Broadband Genie, said:  \\\"Like much of the EU debate, it's hard to cut through the political rhetoric and find hard facts, and that's no different when it comes to roaming. What is clear is that, regardless of the results on June 23, consumers are demanding the abolishment of EU roaming charges.\\\"  Holding corporations to account  The European Commission, the executive arm of the EU, is also an excellent body for holding corporations to account.  The UK, by comparison, has been less successful. Earlier this year, Chancellor George Osborne came under fire after calling the UK's tax deal with Google a \\\"major success\\\", despite backlash against the \\u00a3130 million agreements leniency.  But the EU has no qualms about putting pressure on Google. Earlier this year, the Commission formally charged Google with unlawfully \\\"preventing competition\\\" in the mobile (read: Android) and search (read: Google) markets. There is still some deliberation to go through, but the result could a fine against Google for 10% of its global turnover. Considering its annual revenue in 2015 was $74.5 billion, that's no small sum.  Without the EU, it would be much harder for countries to organise collective pressure on multi-national monopolies.  Protecting privacy  The EU also acts as a buffer against national governments trying to infringe the rights of their citizens. Richard Patterson, the director of security, privacy and comparison website Comparitech, puts it neatly:  \\\"While the in-out debates have focused mostly on immigration, spending and so forth, it's also important that the public gives consideration to their right to privacy. The UK's proposed Investigatory Powers bill - or Snooper's Charter - would make it easier for the government to snoop on its citizens, but so far the EU courts have been holding the bill back as it is at odds with European Law. Without this protection, the public's privacy could quite literally be at the stake.\\\"  Patterson added that we could end up in a situation where British citizens have \\\"far less protections than their EU counterparts\\\".  Summary  The UK was split nearly 50/50 on Brexit, but the same certainly is not true of the technology sector. It seems that, on balance, Britain's tech and science industries would have liked us to stay in Europe, and that makes sense. Much of the UK's technology industry is based in London, a city that has benefited massively from the European Union. But in small towns far detached from the hi-tech capital, it's likely that the benefits are less conspicuous.  Nevertheless, almost everyone gains from research in science and technology, and rulings like the abandonment of EU roaming charges are hard to gloss over. Had the referendum only been open to geeks, a Brexit vote just would not have happened. Fact.  It seems that contrary to popular belief, sometimes, computer says yes.
