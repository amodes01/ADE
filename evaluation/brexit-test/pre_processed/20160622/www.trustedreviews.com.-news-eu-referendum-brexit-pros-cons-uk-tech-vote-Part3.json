"{\"uid\": \"www.trustedreviews.com.-news-eu-referendum-brexit-pros-cons-uk-tech-vote-Part3\", \"text\": \"support their growth.\\\"  Nick Bolton, who created Rota, an app that connects hospitality companies to rated staff, believes that Brexit could \\\"cripple\\\" a number of tech start-ups in the UK.  \\\"One of the biggest challenges facing tech start-ups is the shortage of good quality developers and many of these highly skilled workers currently come from the EU.  Bolton argues that the only thing worse for fundraising than a declining economy is an uncertain one, and that Brexit is likely to cause both: \\\"Venture capitalists will look at more certain, stable economies and avoid pouring money into London.\\\"  Investment in science research    Technology is not just about business, though. The UK is one of the largest recipients of research funding in the EU, which has significant impact on science and tech.  According to the Royal Society, we receive a greater amount of EU research funding than we contribute. Between 2007 and 2013, we received 8.8 billion euros for research, development, and innovation activities. It's estimated that we contributed around 5.4 billion euros to Europe's research coffers in return.  Naturally, scientists welcome this cash, which might explain a Nature poll that revealed 83.46% of researchers oppose Brexit, regardless of whether they intend to vote. A further 4.63% are unsure, and 11.91% want to leave the EU. And even amongst researchers that intend to vote, 80% are against leaving the EU.  Professor Stephen Hawking called the prospect of Brexit a \\\"disaster for UK science\\\" in a letter to the Times newspaper, signed by over 150 fellows of the Royal Society. The letter reads:  \\\" First, increased funding has raised greatly the level of European science as a whole and of the UK in particular because we have a competitive edge. Second, we now recruit many of our best researchers from continental Europe, including younger ones who have obtained EU grants and have chosen to move with them here.\\\"  However, Professor Angus Dalgleish, of St George's Hospital at the University of London, who is campaigning for Brexit, argues:  \\\"We are standing up against what is a very large body of people who feel that if we leave the EU it will be a disaster for funding and collaboration - and we completely refute that. The bottom line is that we put far more into Europe than we get out. Any difference we can more than easily make up with the money we would save.\\\"  However, it's not actually guaranteed that the government would match the EU's research spending if we vote for Brexit on Thursday. There is a real risk that the recouped funds could be used elsewhere, leaving tech research high and dry.  How would Brexit affect technology for the average person?  If you are not spending your days in a Shoreditch caf\\u00e9, churning out 'game-changer' apps by the dozen, you have to wonder how the EU's impact on technology affects the average person.  Well, to answer the age-old question of what has the EU ever done for us, here's a quick run-down:  Scrapping EU roaming charges  Last year, the European Union announced plans to lower the price cap on roaming charges as of April 30, 2016. Better still, roaming charges across Europe will be scrapped entirely from 2017. That means you can not be charged extra for using your phone texts, minutes, or data when travelling within the European Union.  That's an impressive feat, and here's why. Unlike the USA, Europe's phone market is hugely complex and fragmented, so getting them to operate on a level playing field is very difficult. It may be fair to say that this simply would never have happened\"}"
