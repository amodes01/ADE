The uncertainty around the future of Europe as we know it sent markets tumbling last week, and the CBOE volatility index, a measure of investor fear, spiked.  Investors have significant positions in foreign funds these days. Over the last decade, investors poured $643 billion into world stock funds, while they pulled $834 billion out of U.S. stock funds, according to the Investment Company Institute's 2016 Fact Book. So they are naturally concerned about how the so-called Brexit could affect their portfolios.  Some investors have recently sold their foreign funds. \\\"Investors pulled $1.1 billion from U.K. equity funds in the week to yesterday, according to data from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. This was the fastest rate of withdrawals in 13 months,\\\" according to data from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. This was the fastest rate of withdrawals in 13 months,\\\" according to The Street.  But we know that the best returns come from staying invested long term. Those who sell out of the market today will have to decide when to get invested again, and history shows that by the time investors feel ready to get back in the market, they have often missed out on significant gains.  Do not let uncertainty hold you back  Often investors wait to see how things progress, but this assumes that eventually they will feel more certain about where the market's headed. The reality is that uncertainty is part of investing, just like it's part of life, and as investors, we have to come to terms with uncertainty if we hope to get ahead.  Even after Thursday's vote, there will still be uncertainty. If Britain votes to leave the E.U., there will be two years of negotiations on the terms of the separation. And even then, we will not know how Britain and the E.U. will do on their own. So if you need to be invested to reach your goals, then get invested. Do not let the uncertainty of a Brexit hold you back from doing the work you need to do to get ahead.  Invest in what you know now -- and adapt as markets change  Focus on what you know now. You know why you are invested and what you are trying to accomplish. For most of us, investing is not just about money, it's about having the freedom to live the life we want-to retire on our schedule, to give our kids the option to go to the college of their choice. These goals are not tied to the result of the British referendum.  You also know that over the long term-even through times of global crisis and political upheaval-investing in stocks has been the best way to make money. The volatility of stocks makes it tough to hold stocks long enough to benefit from their terrific long-term results, but if you stick it out, those gains can change your life.  Another thing you probably know is how different areas of the market have been performing lately and, long before the Brexit, Europe wasn't performing well. Most Europe funds and ETFs have been out of favor for some time now; the iShares MSCI Eurozone ETF (EZU) has lagged the S&P 500 for the last three years running, and my firm's Upgrading strategy has kept us out of these funds.  U.S. funds are currently in favor  Decades of academic research and a January 2016 Morningstar study have found that funds that have done well recently tend to continue to do well for the next few months or even years . At the moment, that means U.S. stock funds. And funds that have not performed well tend to remain out of favor for some time. Academics call this \\\"persistence of performance.\\\"\"}"
