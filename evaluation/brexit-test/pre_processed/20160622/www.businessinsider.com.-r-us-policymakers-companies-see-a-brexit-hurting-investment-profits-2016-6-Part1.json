Market volatility in the immediate aftermath of such an unprecedented decision would likely drive down the British pound and push the U.S. dollar up, keeping Federal Reserve interest rate rises on hold for even longer as the damage is assessed and divorce terms are negotiated with the EU.  Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen on Tuesday repeated the U.S. central bank's concerns over the \\\"Brexit\\\" vote, telling lawmakers it could have \\\"significant economic repercussions\\\", including a flight to the safety of dollar assets that would push up the dollar and further slow U.S. exports.  Britain, the world's fifth largest economy, is the seventh largest U.S. trading partner, with $56 billion in U.S. goods exports to Britain and $58 billion in imports from the UK in 2015.  Advertisement  Aircraft and aircraft engines are the biggest U.S. exports to Britain, while cars and trucks are the largest U.S. imports from the UK, with two-way pharmaceuticals trade important for both countries.  More than half of Britain's exports go to Europe though, where a vote to leave the EU could put it at a disadvantage.  Leaving the EU would cost Britain its privileged free trading status with the continent, throwing up problems for multinational companies with British operations, including higher tariffs on UK-produced cars and engines as well as uncertainty over how banks and insurers in the London financial hub can operate in Europe.  The United Kingdom also would be excluded from EU free trade agreements with other countries, such as those with Canada, Mexico and South Korea. The EU currently has Preferential Trade Agreements with 52 countries and is negotiating agreements with another 72.  Advertisement  A massive trans-Atlantic trade deal under negotiation with the United States would also be in jeopardy. President Barack Obama has warned it could be years before Washington is ready to start talks on a bilateral deal with Britain.  \\\"We think a strong UK in a strong and unified European Union is in everybody's interest,\\\" U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman said on Tuesday. \\\"We think their voice is stronger as part of a larger entity.\\\"  It could take Britain up to two years to negotiate new trading and regulatory arrangements with Europe, creating a pall of uncertainty that will dampen trade and capital flows and put business decisions on hold, said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors in New York.  \\\"The likely outcome is more of a pause, an additional slowdown. What are economies struggling with? Global demand is low, trade is low. Growth is slow. None of this will help that,\\\" he added.  GATEWAY TO THE SINGLE MARKET  Advertisement  Foreign direct investment into Britain has been one of the biggest drivers of Britain's economic growth in recent years, and the biggest source of that investment has been the United States.  In a review of the UK economy released on Saturday, the International Monetary Fund concluded that foreign direct investment into the UK, the top investment destination within Europe, had allowed for higher consumption and incomes.
