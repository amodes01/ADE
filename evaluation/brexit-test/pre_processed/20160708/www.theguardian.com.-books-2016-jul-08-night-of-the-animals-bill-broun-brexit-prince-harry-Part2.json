In addition to being a vision of our dystopian future, Night of the Animals is deeply engaged with a variety of religious traditions, but particularly with medieval English Christianity. Cuthbert's zoological hallucinations usher in the return of his medieval namesake, the so-called \\\"Christ of the Otters\\\".  Cuthbert, his main character, battles addiction and mental health issues that reflect a sort of road not taken for Broun, who became an alcoholic when he was living in London. During periods of psychic distress, Broun encountered a number of older men who, like Cuthbert, were living on the streets with serious mental illness. \\\"They taught me a great deal about heroism in the face of grave material difficulties,\\\" Broun says. Broun himself is in recovery, sober 25 years.  Broun's writing career had a somewhat rocky start. For a long time he considered himself a failed writer, after a publishing deal for a book of short stories fell through. Night of the Animals was conceived from his anger over the stories' fate. \\\"I am letting the animals out of the zoo,\\\" is how Broun sums up his feelings at the time. The novel would take Broun 14 years to write.  Meanwhile, Broun married and had a son, and got a job as an associate professor at East Stroudsburg University in Pennsylvania. His students, who are mostly first-generation college students, inspire him. \\\"It's hard to feel sorry for yourself when you are teaching young people who are working two jobs and trying to raise a family while going through college.\\\"    Broun was encouraged in his writing by his literary fairy godmother, the novelist Mary Gaitskill, who he first met while studying for an master's degree at the University of Houston in the late 1990s. Broun helped Gaitskill learn how to drive, and regularly drove the author to the Whole Foods so she could buy groceries. She repaid him by believing in his work, and needling him to finish the book. Broun calls Giatskill \\\"incredibly generous\\\".  He credits Gaitskill, along with his wife Annmarie Drury, a scholar of Victorian literature and poet, for helping him. \\\"For years I just felt utter hopelessness. For years I thought: 'I hate this fucking novel. I hate fucking writing it. I hate that everyone wants me to keep writing it and I wish they would all just fuck off.'\\\"  The end result seems to have been worth it. Broun's novel feels eerily adept at predicting the technologies that will characterize the next few decades: characters communicate using \\\"SkinWerks\\\", a \\\"bioelectric emollient sprayed onto the epidermis\\\" that allows \\\"wearers to read and type upon their own skin \\u2026 to exchange tactile sensations, and to display digital images\\\". But it is above all a messianic story, culminating in a denouement that combines Cuthbert's hallucinations, the coming comet and a miracle.  In a similarly millenarian spirit, I ask Broun if he feels like we are doomed after Brexit. \\\"Categorically, no,\\\" he says.  Broun believes there will be some kind of redemption. Animals have a role, he thinks. \\\"I am not like, 'I can not wait to till the rapture comes,'\\\" he says. \\\"But I see a kind of new, green world. It's connected to god and it's connected to animals. I do not understand how. But I know it.\\\"\"}"
