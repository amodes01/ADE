On this day in 1709, Russia defeats Sweden at the Battle of Poltava, forever shifting the region's balance of power. Send your friends this link: http://get.defenseone.com/d-brief/. And let us know your news: the-d-brief@defenseone.com.  U.S. will deploy THAAD to South Korea. Pentagon officials made the announcement last night, Defense News reports. The officials stressed that the anti-missile system is being sent in reaction to North Korea, which has been issuing threats and conducting ever-more advanced weapons tests. In effect, they all but screamed \\\"China, this is not about you.\\\"  But that's not likely to wash in Beijing. Why? As Elbridge Colby of the Center for a New American Security sees it, China dislikes THAAD's missiles but hates its radar, which could track PLA launches. Beijing sees THAAD as a threat to its retaliatory capacity, and therefore, a reason to start building more nukes. So this decision to beef up defenses against NorK has the potential to destabilize the nuclear balance with China. Read more, here.  And here's more on \\\"The US Missile System Driving a Wedge Between China, South Korea.\\\"  Brexit fears loom as U.K. airshows begin. The long-awaited debut of the F-35 in the U.K. has collided with the economic instability fears following Britons' vote to leave the European Union. \\\"I think much of this lies ahead of us as to actually what the impact will be,\\\" Jeff Babione, executive vice president and general manager of the F-35 program for Lockheed Martin, said Thursday. Defense One's Global Business Editor Marcus Weisgerber breaks down what to expect at the Farnborough Air Show. More here.  This week, however, there is the Royal International Air Tattoo, one of the world's largest military air shows that officially opened this morning. Defense One got a sneak peek Thursday as many of the planes arrived at RIAT (pronounced ree-ott). Check out some of his pictures, here.  When will the Air Force's F-35 be ready for battle? Gen. Herbert \\\"Hawk\\\" Carlisle, head of Air Combat Command who will make that decision, gave a whole lot of clues for when he will declare the Joint Strike Fighter war ready during an international media day hosted by the plane-maker Lockheed Martin at RIAT. The Air Force has said the plane will be battle ready between August and December. \\\"I personally believe that we are going to be able to declare IOC at the leading edge of that window,\\\" Carlisle said. \\\"So as we look at things, we are getting close.\\\" More here.  Among the F-35 criticisms is: can it dogfight? \\\"It handles the way we want it to handle,\\\" said Maj. Will Andreotta, a U.S. Air Force F-35 pilot and commander of the Lightning II Heritage Flight Team. \\\"The whole idea of stealth and when an aircraft is optimized for stealth is that we are never seen,\\\" he said. \\\"But with that being said, if we do get in a dogfight, I have complete confidence in this aircraft \\u2026 and the pilots that we have flying those aircraft.\\\"  Let us now shift to the F-22 Raptor, which of course is here too. It flew its practice run yesterday, its roaring engines prompting F-35 pilots to occasionally pause their discussion with reporters in a tent next to the flightline. Congress has asked to Air Force to reconsider what it would take to build more of the stealthy jets. In April, we told you it would take a lot to restart production, which was halted in 2012. Since then, many of the jet's subcontractors have \\\"gone on to other things,\\\" Carlisle said. \\\"The F-22 is a fantastic airplane, but getting that back up to speed\"}"
