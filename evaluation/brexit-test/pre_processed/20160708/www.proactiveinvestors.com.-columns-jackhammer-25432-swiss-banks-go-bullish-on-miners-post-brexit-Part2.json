After all, spare a thought for those poor down-at-heel chaps at Goldman Sachs. Goldman rated Fresnillo (LON:FRES) a \\\"sell\\\" at 1,194p as recently as 15 June. The price is now well over 1,900p, blowing Goldman's call well out of the water for the foreseeable future.  That's a performance that's been mirrored by Randgold in London, up by more than 30% in sterling terms to 9,730p at the last count.  But it's not all about sterling. Closer to home, Goldman also called Gold Fields (JSE:GFI) a sell at R63.8, setting a R50 price target. Today's price is R80.  Let us hope the Swiss can do a little bit better than that.\"}"
