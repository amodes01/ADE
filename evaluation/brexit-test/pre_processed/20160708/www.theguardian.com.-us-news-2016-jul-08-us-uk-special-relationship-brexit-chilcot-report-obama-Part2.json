But, as Chilcot's revelations of the Blair/Bush correspondence demonstrate, the offer of British troops is no longer the guarantee of either military success or reciprocal political influence that it was when the special relationship was first forged during the second world war.  For American scholars of the evolving ties between London and Washington, the relationship was never as clear-cut or special as politicians would like to claim it was, but it has definitely seen better days.  Lynne Olson is author of Citizens of London, which revealed the extraordinary lengths Winston Churchill went to persuade a reluctant US president to join a war.  \\\"There is a still a closeness on both sides - within government and within the military - but the relationship seems to have eroded quite a bit,\\\" she says. \\\"The memory of why there was a special relationship, the memory of the war, this has mostly gone. There has been a loosening. It is not what is once was.\\\"  Olson also believes the personal chemistry between politicians and the leadership they provide - or do not - often plays a more significant role than the underlying relations between governments.  \\\"People say that personalities do not count, or question the 'great man theory' of history, but a few people can really change things - as we have just seen with Brexit, for example,\\\" adds Olson.  But others believe the depth of shared history and culture mean both countries will continue to mean a lot to each other whatever the state of letter-writing and summit-making is between the leaders.  \\\"For the American public, neither Brexit nor Chilcot mean very much,\\\" says international relations professor Philip Seib, author of Taken for Granted: The Future of US-British Relations. \\\"From a public standpoint nothing much changes: the primary interest is in other things, like the royal family.\\\"  \\\"When you get to the policymakers, it gets more complicated, particularly after Brexit,\\\" he adds. \\\"But there is a residual feeling that the special relationship is still special: there are so many things that tie the US and UK together. There are not that many countries that are real friends, especially among major powers.\\\"  Yet even relatively sympathetic US observers of Britain question the logic of Blair's gamble during the Iraq war.  According to both the Chilcot report and recent comments by the former prime minister himself, a major factor in his decision to offer such unequivocal support to Bush was a fear that Britain would lose influence and respect in Washington if it stood on the sidelines after the 9/11 attacks.  Countries such as France and Germany that were more cautious did indeed receive US opprobrium at the time - famously leading to French fries being renamed \\\"Freedom Fries\\\" and the only half-in-jest insult \\\"cheese-eating surrender monkey\\\".  But critics of Blair have pointed out that it did little to damage long-term relations with other European powers. Some Democrats in Washington grumble that Blair actually did great harm by facilitating and encouraging the disastrous intervention in Iraq - privately holding him more accountable because he gave the spurious justifications a more articulate veneer.  Had Blair done the opposite, the short-term consequences for the special relationship might have been negative, but respect and sympathy for the UK in the long term may have, with hindsight, been improved.  Above all, it seems that Blair once again proved the\"}"
