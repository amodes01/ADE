"{\"uid\": \"observer.com.-2016-07-brexit-brings-final-death-to-british-empire--Part2\", \"text\": \"have a small country \\u2026 England and Wales perhaps.\\\"  Historian Arnold Toynbee has ventured a few thoughts on history, time and destiny. The long sweeps of great empires like Caesar's and Victoria's do not die necessarily, he writes. They change into something else. Yang will yield to Yin in a historic, transformational period of equilibrium-a turning in a time of defaulting power, devolving nation states and uncertainty; a time of \\\"no country . . . no religion too.\\\"  And the Extravert, Caesar, will be seen to have spent a thousand years to the end of days only to have built a nest for the Introvert, the Christ, sure to follow in his passing. Together they will form particle and wave of their epoch. The disintegration of a civilization, \\\"discharges itself in a full cycle of the alternating rhythm of Yin-and-Yang\\\" writes Toynbee in his classic text, A Study of History.  We have now come full cycle: a turning, with Britain getting there first. A time of dread interspersed with moments of euphoric anticipation. The feeling of imminent collapse in a world without walls, suddenly revealing the vulnerabilities behind its joys, riches and pleasures; a chilling sense that something is coming. It is just ahead. Something unknown to us before. And it's coming here, too.\"}"
