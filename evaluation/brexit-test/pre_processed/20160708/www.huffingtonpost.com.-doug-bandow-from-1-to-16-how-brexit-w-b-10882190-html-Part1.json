"{\"uid\": \"www.huffingtonpost.com.-doug-bandow-from-1-to-16-how-brexit-w-b-10882190-html-Part1\", \"text\": \"Watching the Brexit campaign and aftermath generated mixed feelings: It was a little like the man who saw his mother-in-law drive his new Mercedes off a cliff. In the United Kingdom some people who hated free trade, immigration, and market innovation challenged the officious, wannabe super-state headquartered in Brussels. Who to cheer for?  The Brexiteers, who deserve at least a couple hurrahs. The European Union created a common economic market throughout the continent, an undoubted good, but since then has focused on becoming a meddling Leviathan like that in Washington, D.C. For Britain the virtues of remaining appeared to this American to pale compared to the likely costs of continued subservience to Brussels. In a variety of admittedly imperfect ways Brexit promoted liberty, community, democracy, and the rule of law. In short, the good guys won.  1) Average folks took on the commanding heights of politics, business, journalism, and academia and triumphed. Obviously, the \\\"little guy\\\" is not always right, but the fact he can win evidences a system which remains open to those the Bible refers to as \\\"the least of us.\\\" The wealthiest, best organized, and most publicized factions do not always succeed.

It's a false choice in this case, but people recognized that the sum of human existence is not material. The problem is not just the decisions previously taken away from those elected to govern the UK; it's also the decisions that would have been taken away in the future had \\\"Remain\\\" won.  3) Those governed decided that they should make fundamental decisions about who would rule over them. The Eurocrats, a gaggle of politicians, bureaucrats, journalists, academics, lobbyists, businessmen, and others, were determined to achieve their ends no matter what the European people thought. A constitution rejected? Use a treaty. A treaty rejected? Vote again. A busted monetary union? Force a political union. And never, ever consult the public. No longer, said the British.  4) The rule of law will be respected--or at least not so flagrantly flouted. Those signing up as EU members did not realize that the EU would be a transfer union. At least some countries likely would not have ratified the Lisbon Treaty, expanding Brussels' writ, had they realized that explicit strictures against bail-outs would be ostentatiously ignored. No doubt the \\\"usual suspects\\\" believed they were doing the Lord's work by violating legal guarantees. But today no one living under the EU has any assurance that laws made, rules issued, and promises offered will be kept.  5) Routine incantations of the need for \\\"more Europe\\\" and importance of \\\"European solidarity\\\" no longer will be confused with arguments. Those in charge always want more--more money to distribute, publicity to satisfy, rules to enforce, and power to wield. Their vision of \\\"more Europe\\\" is Europe giving them more. \\\"European solidarity\\\" means others caring for them after they have wasted everything under their control.  Advertisement  6) Democracy will have triumphed over bureaucratic inertia. The EU is known for its \\\"democratic deficit,\\\" a hydra-headed, unelected executive and a weak parliament chosen by people usually voting on domestic issues, using the polls for the European Parliament to punish errant governments at home. The Brussels bureaucracy has become the perfect means to impose policies which lack political support among member governments and peoples.\"}"
