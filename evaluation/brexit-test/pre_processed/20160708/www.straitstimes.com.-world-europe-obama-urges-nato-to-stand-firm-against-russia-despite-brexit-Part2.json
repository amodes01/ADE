However, a White House spokesman said they reached no agreement on cooperation in fighting Islamic State militants in Syria during that call on Wednesday.  BRITAIN  Outgoing British Prime Minister David Cameron, who said he will resign after losing the referendum on EU membership last month, will seek to emphasise an active commitment to Western security at his final Nato summit, to offset any concern about Europe's biggest military spender leaving the EU.  The first item on the summit agenda was the signing of an agreement between the EU and Nato on deeper military and security cooperation.  The US-led alliance is also expected to announce its support for the EU's Mediterranean interdiction operation. Nato already supports EU efforts to stem a flood of refugees and migrants from Turkey into Greece, in conjunction with an EU-Turkey deal to curb migration in return for benefits for Ankara.  Obama and the other Nato leaders will have a more unscripted discussion of how to deal with Russia over dinner in the same room of the Polish Presidential Palace where the Warsaw Pact was signed in 1955, creating the Soviet-dominated military alliance that was Nato's adversary during the Cold War.  Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg sought to balance the new military deployments and air patrols close to Russia's borders by stressing the alliance would continue to seek\\\"meaningful and constructive dialogue\\\" with Moscow.  \\\"We do not want a new Cold War,\\\" he told reporters. \\\"The Cold War is history and it should remain history.\\\"  Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan told reporters before leaving Ankara to attend the summit that Nato also needed to adapt to do more to fight a threat from Islamic State militants, who were accused of last week's deadly attack on Istanbul airport.  \\\"As we have seen from the terrorist attacks first in Istanbul and then in Iraq and Saudi Arabia, international security is becoming more fragile,\\\" Erdogan said.  \\\"The concept of a security threat is undergoing a serious change. In this process, Nato needs to be more active and has to update itself against the new security threats,\\\" he said.\"}"
