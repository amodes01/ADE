In 2007, the value of the GBP hit a record doubling the value of the U.S. dollar. As of 2024, the British pound is the fourth strongest currency in the world, maintaining a steady value of over 1.20 USD including an exchange rate of 1.30 as of October 2024.  The value of the British pound is explained by a combination of factors, like interest rates, inflation, and the overall state of the economy. The strength of the GDP is driven mainly by the fact that the Bank of England, which issues the currency, has played an active role in international economic developments. However, in recent years especially since Brexit, the GBP has weakened due to higher interest rates and fear of a recession, while the U.S. dollar has strengthened.  Key Takeaways For more than 20 years, the British pound has been stronger than the U.S. dollar in nominal terms.  Brexit weakened the British pound on a structural level.  Lack of market confidence in both the government of then-U.K. Prime Minister Liz Truss and Trussonomics further weakened the pound.  The jettisoning of the Truss tax cuts by Jeremy Hunt, the current Chancellor of the Exchequer, seems to have stabilized markets and consequentially halted the decline of the pound.  A Brief History of the U.K. Pound (GBP) vs. the U.S. Dollar (USD)  Before World War II, and arguably before World War I, the British pound (GBP) was the primary medium of foreign exchange, giving it a nominal premium over other currencies including the U.S. dollar (USD), with a pound (\\u00a31) fetching $5 and more. After WWII, however, the USD began its rise to become the preeminent currency in international trade and a global store of value.  For example, as of the end of 2022, the USD comprised 58% of global foreign exchange holdings. Starting from those lofty valuations, the USD began to supplant the GBP, leading to a long slide in the GBP/USD rate over the succeeding decades.  The British pound (aka the sterling) has been nominally stronger than the USD for most of the past few decades, making a high of just over 2.00 USD per GBP around the time of the Great Financial Crisis (GFC) of 2007-2009. The GFC saw investors flee to the USD and out of the pound, among other major currencies. Once the GFC dust had settled, the GBP dropped to the 1.40-1.45 level. The GBP weakness was more a case of panic buying of the USD than any GBP-negative issue, as other major currencies weakened sharply against the USD as well (see long-term chart below).  In subsequent years, GBP/USD fluctuated between roughly 1.40 and 1.70, but then came Brexit in June 2016, when the United Kingdom surprisingly voted to leave the European Union (EU). The pound was knocked down virtually overnight from the 1.40-1.45 area to the 30-year low of 1.32, where it remained until recent events and market dislocations.  The culprit this time is a combination of factors, chief among them USD strength due to widening interest rate differentials in the USD's favor. Along with higher relative interest rates, the U.S. economic outlook is reasonably positive, while market watchers are soon to declare the U.K. is in or near recession. The pound is not alone in being sold against the USD, as investors fear a global recession and favor the greenback as a safe haven in times of economic distress.  Nominal Value vs. Relative Value  The nominal value of a currency is relatively arbitrary. What matters is how the value of that currency changes over time relative to other currencies.
