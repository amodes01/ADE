Furman said passing the TPP is \\\"perfectly reasonable\\\" - even with a new administration moving into the White House in January - because the agreement will have been available for public scrutiny for a year by that time, much longer than most legislation gets vetted.

POLL: TRADE POPULAR IN SWING STATES AND WITH DEMS: Trade is more popular with voters in swing states than the presumptive Democratic and Republican presidential nominees might think, especially among Democrats, according to a new poll.  Voters in four battleground states - Colorado, Florida, Nevada and Ohio - expressed positive views about the U.S. expanding trade, even while Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump call for major changes to the nation's global commercial outreach.  A new Progressive Policy Institute (PPI) poll on Wednesday shows that by a 55 to 32 percent margin swing-state voters say that new high-standard trade deals can help the U.S. economy and support good-paying jobs.  Democrats are particularly supportive, 66 to 25 percent.  All four states will play an outsized role in who wins the presidency in November: http://bit.ly/28TZS15.
