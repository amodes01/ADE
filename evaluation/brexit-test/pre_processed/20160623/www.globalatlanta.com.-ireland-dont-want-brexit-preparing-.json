"{\"uid\": \"www.globalatlanta.com.-ireland-dont-want-brexit-preparing-\", \"text\": \"Hope for the best; prepare for the worst. That's how Ireland is viewing today's referendum on the British membership in the European Union, a divisive debate where polls have shown citizens vacillating between \\\"Leave\\\" and \\\"Remain\\\" in the days leading up to the decisive vote.  From an economic perspective, Ireland would very much like the United Kingdom to remain in the bloc, citing the uncertainty that would follow a \\\"Brexit,\\\" as the abandonment of the status quo has been called.  \\\"They are our largest trading partner, and we are unequivocal in our view that it would be better for everybody, including the Irish, if the United Kingdom stays within the EU,\\\" said Emmanuel Dowdall, head of IDA Ireland for North America, who fears a two-year period of uncertainty that would follow if Britain has to negotiate the terms of its EU breakup. In terms of trade deals, the U.K. would have to start from scratch, and what's hammered out with the EU as a whole would affect all its individual European trading relationships.  Brexit could have a potential downward impact on the British pound, hurt bilateral trade with Ireland and engender ambiguous implications for the credibility of the EU, he said.  \\\"I think it validates the strength and the aspirations of the European Union in a way that would be far better if they stayed,\\\" he said.  That said, the EU's only other English-speaking country (and already the only one in the euro area) realizes that many multinational corporate headquarters would be up for grabs, given that that many want one base for the entire 28-member bloc.  \\\"We are already having a very good level of success in terms of (foreign direct investment), but I do think that in the short term you will see some increased activity, particularly in the financial services environment,\\\" Mr. Dowdall said in an interview in late May in Atlanta, where he previously worked and maintains a home. \\\"From that perspective, Ireland is already hearing from companies that are doing a range of scenario planning.\\\"  Ireland knows a thing or two about how investors value predictability when making major decisions.  The country underwent a major financial crisis caused by a property bust in 2009 but had the discipline to implement austerity measures that have reined in debt without touching the sacrosanct corporate tax rate of 12.5 percent. That has been a major arrow in Ireland's recruitment quiver.  \\\"Ireland was able to restructure and re-profile itself to international investors,\\\" Mr. Dowdall said.  In 2015, FDI surged to record levels, and more importantly for a country that has embarked on a job creation plan, the levels of employment by foreign investors also swelled. The economy overall grew by more than 7 percent last year.  About 180,000 jobs in Ireland, a country of 4 million people, are directly supported by foreign investment, 137,000 of them by companies from the United States. Multiplied out by broader economic impacts of those infusions, Invest Ireland calculates that nearly 20 percent of the total private-sector labor force can be traced back to investment from overseas.\"}"
