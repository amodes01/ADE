Polling before Wednesday suggested the vote is finely balanced between the two camps, while financial markets and betting odds indicate \\\"Remain\\\" is on course to win. Recommended from Editorial Terence Corcoran: Trump, Clinton and Brexit - the three horses of democracy's Apocalypse Joe Chidley: These are the lessons of Brexit, regardless of what happens with the vote Could Plunge In the event of a Brexit, developed world markets could plunge as much as 8 per cent over the following two trading days, Belisle said. The Canadian market meanwhile could drop 6 per cent to 12 per cent. If there is a correction in crude prices, Belisle will be on the hunt for Canadian energy stocks.
