"{\"uid\": \"www.cjnews.com.-news-international-french-jews-dreading-brexit-vote-Part3\", \"text\": \"opposing the campaign for divestment and sanctions, or do you want us outside the room?\\\" Cameron said on June 20 during an address at a Jewish health and social services charity.  Guy Bechor, a prominent Israeli historian and a columnist for Yedioth Acharonoth, disputed this assertion, noting Britain's own record on Israel within the EU is sometimes less than satisfactory to its supporters. While Britain is Israel's largest EU trade partner, it is also one of only three EU states that use separate labelling for settlement goods - a practice Israel vociferously opposes.  And in the 68 years since Israel was founded in territory once controlled by Britain, no member of the British royal family has ever visited Israel in an official capacity, though many visits were paid to Arab countries.  \\\"Israel generally performs well in bilateral relations and poorly in international blocs that are committed to the lowest common denominator,\\\" Bechor opined in an article published last month on his website.  For Alderman, though, \\\"Brexit comes down to a question of sovereignty,\\\" he wrote. \\\"As a religious Jew, I pray for the welfare of the nation. And that is why I shall be voting for Brexit on June 23.\\\"\"}"
