"{\"uid\": \"www.cjnews.com.-news-international-french-jews-dreading-brexit-vote-Part2\", \"text\": \"Paris and London are only a two-hour train ride away, facilitating family visits.  Under EU agreements, citizens of member states may relocate and work in any of the bloc's 28 member states without requiring permission, often simply by registering as residents with their EU passport with the local municipality. For Europeans, a Brexit is expected to mean some sort of application process for residence in the U.K., possibly involving a vetting process by British immigration authorities.  The ability to escape anti-Semitism is among the arguments for remaining in a union that allows individuals greater freedom to move among member states.  Some Jews feel safer in Britain than in France, although anti-Semitism here remains a problem. In 2013, 69 violent anti-Semitic attacks were recorded in Britain compared to 105 in France, meaning Jews were 1.3 times likelier to be physically assaulted in Britain. In some other years, French Jews were likelier to be attacked, though not by much.  \\\"The risks are the same risks, guards are sadly necessary in synagogues here and in France,\\\" said Sacha Bielawski, a 38-year-old father of two who came to London 10 years ago from Paris and works in finance. \\\"I feel equally safe and unsafe in both countries.\\\"  Linda Borowski, a computer specialist from Brussels who moved to London 10 years ago, says she is now in the process of immigrating to the United States because of the threat of jihadism.  \\\"My children are targets here every bit as much as in Brussels,\\\" she said. \\\"I do not want to raise them in fear or under guard.\\\"  Herz said the British media was playing up the risk to Jews in France and portraying Britain as a refuge in what he called \\\"French bashing.\\\" Jewish immigration to London \\\"is part of a major wave of general emigration from France\\\" and is not specific to Jews, he said.  Whatever the reason, the recent arrival of hundreds of French Jews to Britain led to the establishment of Francophone Jewish communities in three London synagogues and the formation of predominantly French-speaking classrooms in at least one Jewish London school.  Many of the French Jews of London have little to fear even in the event of Brexit, said Bielawski.  \\\"A realistic solution will be found to the visa issue,\\\" he said. \\\"The London finance industry and market is full of foreigners; they will have to be reasonable if they want to avoid a collapse.\\\"  But newcomers like the Herzes are less certain than longtime residents, who have accumulated various rights over time, including to vote in some local elections and referendums. In the Brexit referendum, however, only British, Irish and Commonwealth citizens who live in the U.K. may vote.  British Jews are far more divided on the issue than the French Jews among them.  Robert Halfon, a British-Jewish lawmaker, argued in a March op-ed in the Jewish News that remaining would allow London to positively influence EU policy on Israel.  But Geoffrey Alderman, a historian and former member of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, disputed the point. In an op-ed the same month in the Jewish Chronicle, he asserted that British Jews are better off lobbying for communal interests in London, which they know, than in Brussels, where they have less sway and which is perceived as more hostile to Israel.
