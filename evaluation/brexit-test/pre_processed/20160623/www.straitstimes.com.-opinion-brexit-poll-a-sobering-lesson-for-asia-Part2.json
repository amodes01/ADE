This week, those ties went further south when Beijing drew Asean's largest member-nation into the South China Sea dispute by saying it has \\\"overlapping claims\\\" with Indonesia on waters around the Natunas.  It is a slippery slope when passion replaces reasoned argument. The political considerations that informed some in the Leave camp were all too evident when Justice Secretary Michael Gove, who is for Brexit, pronounced himself \\\"sick of experts\\\" after one credible voice after another stood up for the Remain argument.  More frightening, the Leave camp did not seem to care about the wider implications of Brexit. As this newspaper reported on Monday, pro-Europe Scotland could never accept Brexit without planning its own exit from the UK.  With the referendum done, Europe now has to work even harder to ensure that it does not lose so much of what it has gained in the past half-century.  Last week, British entrepreneur Richard Branson, whose grandfather fought in World War I and his own father in World War II, reminded readers in published newspaper advertisements that not a single bullet had been fired between the armies of EU member states. \\\"I truly believe that one of the EU's greatest achievements is that it has kept its members out of conflict in Europe,\\\" he wrote.  The role of media, too, will need some scrutiny. Ms Jo Cox, the murdered MP, used to complain bitterly about the unrestrained hate messages she often got on social media from people who disagreed with her.  \\\"It is not a big journey from saying horrible things to doing horrible things,\\\" Labour MP Stephen Kinnock, who was a close friend of Ms Cox, told the BBC after her death. Good politicians like Ms Cox keep their constituents close. What if, because of fears over safety, that proximity will have to be restricted?  The boost the Leave campaign got from the mass-circulation Sun, owned by Mr Rupert Murdoch, has not been missed. In Liverpool last week, a cabbie who was for Remain expressed his deep anger at people being misled by this \\\"American-owned Sun\\\".  What skin did Mr Murdoch have in the Brexit game? According to London's Evening Standard newspaper, he once confessed he was so opposed to Europe because \\\"when I go into Downing Street they do what I say; when I go to Brussels they take no notice\\\".  It is an old quote and to be fair to the media tycoon, his other paper The Times had lent tenuous support editorially for Remain. Even so, it is a point worth pondering.  The recent vote is not the last word on European integration - or disintegration - only a key punctuation mark along the road. The gains by Germany's Alternative for Deutschland and Ms Marine Le Pen's National Front in France suggest that the winds of xenophobia and isolationism may be only just starting in the continent.  Asians need to put their heads together to ensure that not only are they insulated from the fallout, but also to make sure these trends do not consume them as well.\"}"
