Their studies tally with independent studies of the same things, and sometimes they are using independent studies rather than anything they control.  The worst I was able to prove was that one point in a 90-page review seemed to lack backup evidence. And that's the same review whose conclusion almost all credible external sources agreed with.  I really wasn't expecting that. I was expecting both sides - as many people have claimed - to be equally full of it.  But Remain seems to have played it pretty straight, and presented solid, well-founded claims. Having dug deep into their campaign, I have actually emerged more impressed than when I started.  So Which Way Should You Vote?  Based purely on which side's arguments are actually true, and which side's are not, you should vote Remain.  Remain claim that Brexit would be bad for the country, and they have presented evidence to support that claim. I have checked quite a lot of that evidence, and it all seems to be reliable.  Remain appear to be telling the truth, Leave do not.\"}"
