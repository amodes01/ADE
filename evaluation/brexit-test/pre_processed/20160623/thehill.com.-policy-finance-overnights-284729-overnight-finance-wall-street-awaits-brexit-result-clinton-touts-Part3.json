In February, unknown hackers stole $81 million from the Bangladesh Bank account at the New York Fed in what is considered the largest cyberheist in history.  To pull off the heist, the hackers exploited a flaw in SWIFT, a messaging network used by banks across the globe to exchange information about financial transfers.

GOP DRAWS BATTLE LINE WITH OBAMACARE: Speaker Paul Ryan on Wednesday formally unveiled the House GOP alternative plan for the Affordable Care Act, billing it as the culmination of years of party pledges and effort.  \\\"For six years now, we have promised to repeal and replace ObamaCare and make healthcare actually affordable,\\\" the Wisconsin Republican said at an event at the American Enterprise Institute. \\\"Well, here it is: a real plan - in black and white - right here.\\\"  The plan envisions a simpler system than ObamaCare with limited financial assistance, lighter regulation and less federal spending on healthcare. It allows for less generous, basic health plans, as opposed to ObamaCare plans, which must cover an array of required elements.  Democrats immediately attacked the plan, saying it is just a broad outline, and one that, if ever implemented, would roll back the coverage gains of ObamaCare.

CONFEDERATE FLAG BAN DROPPED FROM SPENDING BILL: A measure to restrict the display of the Confederate battle flag in national cemeteries approved by the House last month has been pulled from the chamber's final compromise spending bill.  The House passed a spending package along party lines early Thursday morning that includes appropriations for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), as well as emergency funding for combating the Zika virus.  Rep. Jared Huffman's (D-Calif.) amendment, adopted as part of the House's version of the 2017 VA spending bill, would have prohibited the large-scale display of the Confederate battle flag in cemeteries run by the VA, such as flying the banner over mass graves.  It would still have allowed families to still place small flags on individual graves on two days of the year: Memorial Day and Confederate Memorial Day.

TAX BREAK TALK: House Ways and Means Committee ranking member Sandy Levin (D-Mich.) on Thursday expressed optimism that Congress will eliminate the carried interest tax break in the future.  \\\"If we go to the public \\u2026 my guess is that the overwhelming number of people would say, overwhelmingly, that carried interest is a loophole that needs to go,\\\" Levin said at a press conference.  Carried interest refers to the share of profits that investment fund managers take in exchange for running the funds. Carried interest is currently taxed as capital gains rather than like normal income.  Levin and Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) last year introduced legislation that would tax carried interest as income. The lawmakers spoke about the need to end the tax break along with members of the Patriotic Millionaires, a group of wealthy individuals who want to reduce income inequality.
