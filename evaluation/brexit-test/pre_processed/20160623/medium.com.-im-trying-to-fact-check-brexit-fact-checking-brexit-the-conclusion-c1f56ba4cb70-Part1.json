I have read 90-page government reports on my way to a wedding. I have hacked through academic analyses of the EU when I really should have been promoting my Virtual Reality game. I have treated myself to a fun Google search for the accounts of pro-Remain activists to check that they are not biased. And so on.  (Here are all the posts I wrote as a result. )  It has been surprisingly interesting, in some ways. And frustrating in others.  But that's not what you care about.  You care about who's telling the truth, who is not, and who you should vote for.  So who's more reliable?  I came into this leaning cautiously to Remain. However, I really hoped to find that my initial impressions of Leave were wildly wrong, and I was hoping they had very strong arguments.  Why? Because the country might vote for Leave. And if that happens I'd much rather be saying \\\"well, at the end of the day both sides have a good point\\\" than \\\"oh god, oh god, we are in real trouble now\\\".  Unfortunately, \\\"well, at the end of the day both sides have a good point\\\" is not what I found.  Leave's Reliability  At every single turn, I found that the Leave campaign's arguments were founded on lies. Sorry, it's as simple as that. I wish it wasn't.  They lie about how much money we spend on the EU. I'd love to say \\\"they are misinformed\\\", or \\\"they exaggerate\\\", but they do not. They lie. Outright.  They lie about the business case for Leave. I still have found absolutely no support whatsoever for the figures that are confidently quoted here.  They lie about the state of democracy in the EU. The more I investigate the EU, the more I find out it's fairer and better set up than the UK's government. Just today I discovered that the European Commission's role in legislation is actually far more balanced than I thought.  And the Leave campaign lie a lot more. I have not had time to post all the mini-fact-checks I have found. As just one example, the Vote Leave website claims  Because of free movement laws, the UK cannot test every EU doctor operating in the UK for whether they can speak English  As proof, they link to an article in the Guardian about a horrible accident thanks to a doctor not understanding English. In that article, it explicitly states:  The GMC, which registers doctors and licenses them to work, has been able to check EU medics' English since last summer\\u2026  In other words, Leave's statement is absolutely untrue, and that's proved by an article they themselves use as \\\"proof\\\" of their untrue statement.  I have not had time to fact-check every single Leave claim, and some, like the claim that leaving \\\"will make Britain Great again\\\", are not possible to fact-check.  But every single Leave claim I have checked has turned out not to be exaggeration, not to be well-meaning misunderstanding, but to be obviously false.  Remain's Reliability  Remain's campaign has been criticised for being dull, being negative, and being led by people who are thoroughly disliked.  All of those claims are entirely reasonable. Personally I intensely dislike both Cameron and Osborne. I am about as much of a fan of the current UK government as I am of bowel cancer.  But every claim of theirs I have checked - even the ones that had pro-Remain friends shouting about how over the top and ridiculous they were has turned out to be more or less sound.  Their arguments are evidence-based.  Their evidence is solid.  Their backup studies are detailed and provide sources and reasoning.\"}"
