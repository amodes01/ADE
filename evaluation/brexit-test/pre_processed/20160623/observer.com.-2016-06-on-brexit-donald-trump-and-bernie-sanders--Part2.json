In the presidential campaign this spirit of anxiety, anger and insurgency has manifested itself in the surprisingly strong showing of Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders, both of whom \\\"get it\\\"-but come at the problem from (in most cases) widely differing points of view. Hillary Clinton, I would add, is fundamentally a bystander in the great divide between populists and establishments, trying to maneuver between the two camps, unlike Trump and Sanders, who are both clearly aligned with the anti-establishment camp.  Personally I am very strongly on the Remain side of Brexit, though I fully understand the forces that drive the Leave side. I have had long relationships with Europe, going back to my days in law school where I studied for a semester at St. Edmund Hall at Oxford, and post-law school, where I received a degree from the London School of Economics. During the 1980s I participated in the European Visitors Program, the counterpart to the State Department's Young Leaders program, where I met with high level officials of Britain, France, Germany and the European Union in Brussels and Strasbourg.  If the Leave group prevails there is a real question whether the European Union could break apart. There would be an escalation of other movements to leave the EU in nations across the continent. At the same time, most voters in Scotland want to remain in Europe and it is possible the movement for Scotland to leave Britain would revive to enable Scotland to remain in Europe while leaving Britain. A triumph for the Leave forces would empower separatist and nativist forces across Europe.  In Britain the major players throughout the business establishment are joining forces with the conservative British Prime Minister and the leader of the British Labour party in support of the Remain forces. Will this strong establishment support persuade the public to remain? Or will it create an anti-establishment backlash that carries the Leave forces to victory?  For the same reason that the trade issue is a potent force advancing the Leave cause in Britain, it is one of the few major areas where Trump and Sanders agree-both oppose the Trans Pacific Partnership trade agreement, which Clinton once supported but now opposes.  In American politics this anti-establishment backlash has fueled the candidacies of both Sanders and Trump throughout the primaries.  On the Democratic side, the question is whether Sanders will re-mobilize his small donors and volunteers on behalf of Clinton and efforts to elect liberals to the House and Senate. In the end he almost certainly will, but the intensity and focus of his efforts will decide how effective he ultimately is.  The more immediate impact of the Brexit vote will be on the Trump campaign. If the Leave group wins the Brexit vote it will give some new impetus to the Trump campaign and anti-establishment forces in the U.S.  Politically what bears watching on the Brexit vote will be the relative turnout of the Leave and Remain forces. If the Leave group wins, that could suggest that Trump will benefit from a higher turnout of anti-establishment voters which would give a boost to his campaign as American media will focus on this point while European media will focus quickly and intensely on other nations with movements similar to Brexit. Markets and politics would both become dramatically more unstable in the face of a Leave victory.  The bottom line in American and European politics is that there is a wave of anxiety and backlash against establishments. Sanders gets it, which accounts for his surge during the primaries in the\"}"
