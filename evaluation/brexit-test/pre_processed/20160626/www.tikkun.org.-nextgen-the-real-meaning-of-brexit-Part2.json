"{\"uid\": \"www.tikkun.org.-nextgen-the-real-meaning-of-brexit-Part2\", \"text\": \"prepared to do in the TTIP negotiations, or about ruining their own countries' trade by installing economic sanctions against Russia, or about participating in the extremely dangerous deployment of NATO troops to Eastern Europe - there hardly seems to be any demand from the US government, which EU and European leaders would not fulfill, however devastating its consequences for Europe may be. Just how narrow the ideological tolerance within Europe has become, could be seen last week when German foreign minister Frank Walter Steinmeier courageously dared to condemn the military drills in Eastern Europe as \\\"warmongering\\\" against Russia. As he stated the obvious, he provoked pure outrage from fellow politicians and the media in the Western world.  Or take Greece - a year ago, the EU establishment carried out collective punishment against an entire nation for being so impertinent to demand an exit of the austerity policies. How enthusiastically have countries like Greece, Portugal and Ireland joined the EU, dreaming of economic progress, continental integration and solidarity and how badly have they been impoverished and robbed their sovereignty by being trapped in astronomic debt. However, this is not an issue of Southern vs. Northern Europe, but one of redistributing wealth from the 99% to the 1% throughout Europe, which can be felt by the people from Athens to Liverpool. \\\"Austerity is,\\\" as Chomsky noted, \\\"really class war.\\\"  Capitalist globalization has corroded the social fabric of societies around the world, destroyed solidarity among people and established an anonymous hyper-individualized climate of fierce competition, loneliness and struggle for survival. People are left without any positive prospect for the future, feel constantly cheated on by something or someone that they cannot even precisely name - and immense anger ensues in people's hearts. People thus readily buy in to the xenophobic propaganda telling who to blame for this situation.  The Brexit vote was in big part the expression of a nationalistic reaction to the alienation of neoliberalism. As they spread fear and tried to make immigrants responsible for the economic failures of the Europe that the EU has shaped, the powerful capitalist class (what in the US they call the 1%) provided the foundation for right-wing nationalists to present themselves as \\\"populists\\\" caring about the well-being of those hurt by economic globalization. These right-wing rabble-rousers divert peoples' attention from the obvious injustice of the economic system. Thereby they turn the genuinely revolutionary potential of people's anti-establishment sentiment into the most reactionary direction. As liberal and bourgeois parties increasingly lose popular support in the entire Western world, the far right is becoming the most important political power to keep the current system in place. The tension emerging from the extreme levels of inequality, corruption and lack of prospects for large sections of working peopled has become massive in nearly all Western countries today. Societies - both in Europe, North America and basically worldwide. These societies cannot be kept together for much longer on the basis of the existing social, political and economic orders. If we do not want right wing extremists like Farage, Le Pen, Trump and the likes to take over, another alternative has to become visible worldwide.  In France there have been endless mass protests and strikes against the neoliberal labor reform of President Hollande for months now. It is a resistance of dimensions unheard of in recent\"}"
