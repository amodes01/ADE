"{\"uid\": \"ijpr.org.-post-what-does-brexit-mean-oregon\", \"text\": \"As the U.K. decides to leave the European Union, the question in Oregon is: What does it mean for the state?  Oregon State University assistant professor Alison Johnston said the main issue is stock market volatility.  \\\"I think your big Oregon companies that I know of, companies like Nike, and Intel and Columbia, I do not think they are going to be impacted too much,\\\" Johnston said.  Adidas released a statement to OPB, saying it regrets the U.K.'s decision, but expects the demand for sporting goods to continue.  The U.K. ranks 12th among the top countries for Oregon exports: About 2 percent of the state's exports go there. For comparison, 24 percent of exports go to China.  Johnston said there is also a plus side for Oregonians.  \\\"The good news I guess for anybody doing any traveling in the U.K. anytime soon, they are going to get a big bang for their buck, because the pound is going to be very down in value,\\\" she said.
