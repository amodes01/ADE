The Times liked Obama's smug summary so much that it repeated it in the text box: \\\"A vote that jars with the president's vision of open societies.\\\"  Mr. Obama acknowledged that much of the upheaval gripping American voters -- an angst that is propelling the campaign of Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee -- is driven by fear of technology-driven globalization and anger at job losses prompted by automation. Mr. Trump has exploited such fears, Mr. Obama told National Public Radio in December, calling them \\\"justified, but just misdirected.\\\"  On Friday, even as he held a Google-sponsored virtual conference with entrepreneurs in Britain, Iraq, South Korea and Mexico, the president conceded that interconnectivity still makes many people uncomfortable. \\\"We are better off in a world in which we are trading, and networking, and communicating and sharing ideas,\\\" Mr. Obama said before a panel discussion with Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook founder, on Friday.  Besides the unelected, unaccountable bureaucracy in Brussels, it was the reams of regulations, the flood of refugees and the accompanying threat of social and sexual unrest that were making the British people uncomfortable, not some troglodyte technophobe fear of the modern world's \\\"interconnectivity.\\\"\"}"
