She wasn't pushing independence at all,\\\" the person said. \\\"That was smart ... it's not what Brussels wants to hear.\\\" Alyn Smith, an EU lawmaker for Sturgeon's Scottish National Party (SNP) who won a standing ovation in the chamber on Tuesday with a plea to the EU not to \\\"let Scotland down\\\", stressed: \\\"I am talking about status rather than membership ... Everyone wants to talk about Scottish independence - except us.\\\" Keeping close EU ties, such as in education and research for which Edinburgh has its own powers and a big economic interest, might be achieved in a variety of ways, involving considerably less constitutional acrobatics than Greenland-inspired ideas. These would be much more likely to secure approval by the other 27 EU states. \\\"Reverse Greenland\\\" is just \\\"silly\\\" in the opinion of David Edward, formerly Britain's justice on the EU's top court and, with Smith, a member of an advisory panel Sturgeon set up in the wake of the Brexit vote to explore Scotland's options. Scotland has 100 times the population of Greenland and, in the reverse scenario, it would be England, 10 times bigger again, that was playing \\\"Greenland\\\" to Scotland's \\\"Denmark\\\". In other states with differing internal relations with the EU, it is minority regions, not the main state, which is outside. But, Edward said, the Scottish government could use devolved powers in some areas to rework partnerships with Brussels. AUTONOMOUS PARALLELS Alyn Smith said the advisory group had drawn up a list of all the different territorial arrangements in the EU, which also include for example exemptions from EU tax and economic rules for the likes of French departments in the Caribbean or the English Channel island of Jersey, ruled by the British crown. The closest, though not very close, analogy, Smith thinks, is that of Finland's autonomous, Swedish-speaking Aland Islands. Scotland should look into using devolved powers to take part in EU programs like the Erasmus student system or the Horizon 2020 research fund, in which several non-EU states - including Israel - participate, Edward said: \\\"It's not much but it's something, given Scotland's commitment to academic research.\\\" Sturgeon has not ruled out the possibility of a second independence referendum and Scottish anger at Brexit and chaos in London politics may have bolstered support for secession. But the fall in oil prices has put Scotland's potential finances in a poorer position than two years ago, while the depth of trade ties with England and the problems that a new customs border along the River Tweed would create still leave many unconvinced. The EU also would be unlikely to grant Scotland concessions that Britain has secured during its 43 years of membership. EU officials also caution that Sturgeon should not under-estimate hostility among other member states. The Spanish prime minister, wary of Catalan separatists, was also in Brussels on Wednesday and threw cold water on Scottish EU membership. Yet, the demonstrative pro-European clamor in Scotland has struck a chord with shellshocked EU politicians who, Edward said, are \\\"absolutely fed up to the back teeth\\\" of the British. \\\"At least Nicola Sturgeon maintained goodwill,\\\" he said. MEP Smith said that goodwill could be vital in promoting the kind of legal creativity EU lawyers are renowned for: \\\"Brussels is good at this,\\\" he told Reuters. \\\"So if\"}"
