You exist, therefore it exists. You confirm it by the union from which unity is taking shape. You are the beginning of a great future.\\\"  Today, most of us, like Hugo, are heirs to the idea of nation states, trying to reconcile our love for our countries with a desire to be part of a bigger ensemble - a strong, generous and rich political and economic European Union. But it is difficult. We are torn, unsure. After all, what is it to be European?  For Hugo, the answer is simple. To be and feel European is not to renounce one's identity; it is, on the contrary, to add an extra layer to it and make it richer. \\\"I have written with a profound love for my own country, but without being engrossed by France more than by any other nation. As I advance in life, I grow more simple, and I become more and more patriotic for humanity.\\\"  Europe, a patriotism for humanity - what a beautiful and appropriate definition in our troubled times.  Whichever direction Britain finally chooses to take, leaving the EU, voting again or ignoring the referendum's results, there is still hope that Hugo's dream might one day be achieved - if not by our generation, then by the next one, or the one after.\"}"
