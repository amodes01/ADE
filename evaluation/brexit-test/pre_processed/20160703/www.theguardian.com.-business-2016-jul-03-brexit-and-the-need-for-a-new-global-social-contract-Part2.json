It is hardly surprising that when given an opportunity not available in a general election, where all major parties supported open EU borders, that they leaped at the chance of using the referendum to say no.  Now that the renegotiation era is dawning it is utterly crucial that we in the UK call for controls on damaging open borders to be the key condition for our future relationship with the EU. This will also resonate with the concerns of the populations of the other 27 EU countries, all of whom want to take back control of their economies to enable their local communities to flourish. Most crucially this will help reduce the growing sense of economic insecurity and impotence caused by globalisation's open borders emphasis. It is this that has acted as such an ominous 1930s-style recruiting sergeant for Europe's extreme right.  Colin Hines  Twickenham, Middlesex  Gordon Brown's plan for ensuring that global trade is fair shows yet again what a tragedy for British politics it was not to have a Lib-Lab pact for electoral reform in 2010 in place of the Tory coup which has resulted in economic and political self-destruction.  Margaret Phelps  Penarth, Vale of Glamorgan  A key plank in the leave case seemed to be that there were far more opportunities for trade outside the EU than inside. Could we please hear more about the plans for negotiations with Canada, China, India, and the rest of the world, and less about how to scavenge a few scraps from the EU table.  Vivian Cook  Colchester, Essex  Giles Fraser (Labour is partly to blame for the racists' capture of the EU debate, 1 July) is so well-meaning, and so mistaken. The idea that capitalism can be tamed by one country the size of Britain is a fantasy. The EU was one of our few opportunities to tame the beast; Brexit is only coherent as a political project if you are a rightwing deregulator. And how does Giles think Africa is going to generate the jobs for its projected quadrupling of its population this century without massive investment by international capital? There is so much that can be done to create jobs and hope for people in deprived communities, within the framework of international capitalism, by investing in the transition to a green economy: see the New Climate Economy reports. Abandoning globalisation for protectionism would undermine action on climate change; regional blocs would compete with each other, and focus on energy security by prioritising access to fossil fuel reserves.  Or put another way, in today's world \\\"loving your neighbour\\\" has to mean your neighbour on the other side of the world, too. Giles, your theology is too small.  Huw Brodie  Cardiff  Felicity Lawrence (Report, 1 July) asks what are the options before us in a globalising world and how to respond to migration. Congratulations to her for setting out the progressive answer: a strong social framework that stops the low-wage, long-hours, no-regulation culture that predominates in so much of our labour market and others across Europe. That requires a break from the naive, Panglossian view of globalisation promoted by New Labour, on which \\\"old Labour\\\" took its revenge in the referendum.  In contrast, Giles Fraser peddles the fantasy, that progressives can go against the realities of modern life - where the economy and culture have escaped the boundaries of the nation state - and challenge \\\"the villains\\\" of \\\"advanced capitalism\\\" within one country. As Lawrence shows, the left must not kid itself that there is a progressive bolthole for English\"}"
