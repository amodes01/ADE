The former helicopter test pilot, who returned from a six-month mission to the International Space Station in June, called the referendum result \\\"a surprising decision for everybody\\\" but said it was important to reunite and get on with securing the best future for Britain.  Peake said: \\\"I missed a lot of the campaigning, but I am aware now that it caused divisiveness and some of it was not done in the most positive fashion. We have to put that behind us now and work on unity and moving forwards.\\\"  Peake said the protection of UK scientific research was a priority in the negotiations that lie ahead.  He said: \\\"We have to make sure we do not harm ourselves in areas where the EU was particularly good for us. I do not want to see scientists being punished, and this having negative effects on our science. These are important areas for us to focus on now.\\\"  Scientific research is a major contributor to the UK economy, but it stands to be the greatest loser from Brexit. UK universities receive 10% of their research funds from the EU, and across the country, science is propped up by grants from Brussels. There are signs that UK organisations are already being passed over for EU science collaborations because their future involvement cannot be guaranteed.  Peake is involved in several experiments into the effects of weightlessness on the human body. He had barely been back on Earth a week when Britain voted to leave the EU in a marginal referendum that threw the future unity of the UK into doubt and sent the major political parties into crises from which they have yet to recover.  \\\"I have seen some comments on Twitter saying everything was fine until Tim Peake came back to Earth,\\\" he told the Guardian in his first newspaper interview since landing. \\\"That did make me feel rather bad.\\\"  Peake blasted off to space in December 2015 on what started out as a textbook launch to the International Space Station. But as the Soyuz capsule carrying Peake, the Nasa astronaut Tim Kopra, and the Russian commander, Yuri Malenchenko, prepared to dock with the orbiting station, there was a glitch.  Throughout the whole rendezvous manoeuvre, an alarm warned of high humidity levels in the Soyuz capsule. Though fairly trivial on its own, it masked a second, more serious warning triggered by a sensor that registered a thruster failure. The capsule automatically aborted its approach and retreated to a safe position 90 metres away.  Peake said: \\\"It happened only 17 metres from the station, which is pretty close. At that stage you'd have thought everything was going fine, all the systems have been checked, and we are coming in on the final approach, so it really took us by surprise.\\\" It is thought to be the nearest the Soyuz has ever aborted an automatic docking manoeuvre with the International Space Station.  Malenchenko took over manual control, but the space station was in Earth's shadow at the time and the docking port was hardly visible in the darkness. He steered the capsule in by hand, but was off target, and had to pull back again for a second attempt. On the next approach, he berthed the Soyuz without incident.  Peake returned to Earth on 18 June, having circled the planet nearly 3,000 times during his 186 days in space. He arrived back at the European Space Agency's base in Cologne at 3am on the Sunday morning and spent the night there with his wife, Rebecca, and their two young sons.\"}"
