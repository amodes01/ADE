Why should Britain stay in the EU?  Stability, said the chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. \\\"I am hoping the European Union works out well,\\\" and the more Europe \\\"learns to work together,\\\" the better.  \\\"You know, we started out in our own arrangement with 13 states and we had a lot of problems to work through,\\\" Buffett said. \\\"... It's up to the citizens of the U.K. to figure out what's the best for themselves. My hope is they stay in.\\\"  If Britain does leave the EU, he said, \\\"it will not make any difference to anything Berkshire does. I mean, if I was assured by (British Prime Minister David) Cameron that they were going to stay or leave, it would not change one iota what I am doing in businesses or in stocks.\\\"  Israeli university benefits from shareholders' gift  Two longtime Berkshire shareholders are donating, posthumously, $400 million to Israel's Ben-Gurion University of the Negev.  The desert university said the money is from the estate of Dr. Howard and Lottie Marcus of San Diego. She died in Decem  ber at age 99, and he died in 2014 at age 104.  \\\"I met Howard and Lottie more than 50 years ago through a mutual friend, my lifetime hero Ben Graham,\\\" Buffett told the university. \\\"We hit it off, and they joined my investment partnership. Knowing them, it comes as no surprise that they elected to use their financial success to enhance the lives of thousands of Israeli young people.\\\"  The Marcuses had fled separately from Nazi Germany in the 1930s, but most members of their families died in the Holocaust. They met and married in New York City, Howard becoming a dentist and Lottie working in the secretarial pool at a Wall Street firm where she met Graham.  According to the university, Graham told the Marcuses that one of his students at Columbia University was a prodigy and introduced them to Buffett. They put most of their nest egg into the partnership and later shifted it to Berkshire, leaving it there to accumulate.  Their donation will more than double the university's permanent endowment, the university said, calling it the largest bequest to an Israeli university and possibly the largest donation ever made to any institution in Israel.  The Marcuses had supported the university's research into water, desalination and desert studies since 1997, including a laboratory and scholarships. They believed that solving problems with water is the key to peace in the Middle East.  The university gave the couple honorary doctorates in 2004 and named its campus in Beer-Sheva after them in 2005. Said university President Rivka Carmi:  \\\"Howard and Lottie Marcus were rare and special people, Holocaust survivors who lived a simple and humble life and joined their fate and their legacy to that of the State of Israel. Just as they viewed their fortune as merely a way to fulfill a greater mission, so, too, were they themselves larger than life.\\\"  Influential research  A five-member research group funded by the Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation was instrumental in last month's U.S. Supreme Court ruling that struck down a Texas law on abortion clinics, Bloomberg News reported.  The foundation, named after Buffett's late wife and funded by him, supported the Texas Policy Evaluation Project, known as\"}"
