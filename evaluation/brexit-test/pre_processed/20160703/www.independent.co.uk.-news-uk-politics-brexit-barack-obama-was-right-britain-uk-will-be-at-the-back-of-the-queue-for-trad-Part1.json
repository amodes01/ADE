Reacting to the EU referendum result, Ambassador Matthew Barzun said President Obama had been right to issue his warning about the consequences of Brexit in April.  Mr Barzun told BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs: \\\"The tone in which it was said, there was nothing punitive about it.  Obama on Brexit  \\\"The point was, you are at the front of the queue right now - he [Obama] was saying back in April - because we are doing this big trade deal with the European Union, [the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP)] of which you are a member.  \\\"But if you step out of the front of the queue, by definition you are no longer at the front, and some notion that you can jump further ahead: you just want to say that is not the trend for the types of big deals we are doing these days.\\\"  Mr Barzun's repeat of Mr Obama's back-of-the-queue warning comes after the Vote Leave campaign went into the EU referendum insisting that Brexit would mean Britian gaining the power to strike its own trade deals.  Its website said: \\\"We can speak for ourselves and sign new deals with countries all over the world, creating new jobs and new investment opportunities.\\\"  This was despite the comments of Mr Obama when he visited Downing Street in April.
