"{\"uid\": \"www.salon.com.-2016-07-03-sanders-voters-should-learn-from-brexit-dont-make-the-same-mistake-as-brits-and-support--Part2\", \"text\": \"weeks of paid family leave and 12 weeks of medical leave), break up the big Wall Street banks, and put an \\\"end to the era of mass incarceration\\\" -- all economic issues that directly harm low-income Americans, and which Trump has either barely addressed or not at all.  The point here is not that Clinton is an ideal candidate; as Sanders demonstrated with his campaign, the Democratic Party establishment is deeply flawed, so naturally any politician produced by that system will share its weaknesses. Nevertheless, there is a clear and undeniable difference between Clinton and Trump on the major economic issues facing this country. Each and every time the two candidates part ways, it is because Trump has aligned his policies with those of the wealthy classes of which he is such a conspicuous part. Clinton, for all of her faults, has offered proposals that would demonstrably improve the lives of working class Americans. These are important differences - so much so that, if Sanders supporters are smart, they will make sure they define this election.  This does not mean that they will, though. As the Brexit vote revealed, many on the left are allowing themselves to be co-opted by right-wing populists' use of issues like immigration (where Clinton does not support bigotry and Trump does) and free trade (where the two candidates are the same). If we do not learn from the mistakes of our British counterparts, the consequences of this oversight may be dire.\"}"
