Dubbed the \\\"reverse Greenland\\\" option, that was among ideas kicked around by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon during a flying visit to Brussels after Scots voted heavily against Brexit while their southern neighbors opted to quit the EU.  Sturgeon, a pro-independence nationalist, stressed during her visit to the EU capital on Wednesday that she was keeping an open mind and simply wanted \\\"all of the options for Scotland\\\" considered once a new British government starts negotiations on what, in principle, is supposed be a two-year divorce process.  But several people involved in the meetings she had with the EU executive and lawmakers told Reuters that ideas discussed included possible models based on the fact that several states have some parts in the EU and some outside - as in the case of EU member Denmark and its non-EU territory Greenland.  At its most extreme - and, in the view of officials and experts, deeply implausible - a \\\"reverse Greenland\\\" solution might see the Scottish government in Edinburgh take on Britain's EU membership while remaining in the United Kingdom and the UK government in London would, like Greenland in the 1980s, pull England out of the EU while keeping the British state united.  More plausibly, Sturgeon's warm reception in Brussels amid the shock of Brexit, highlighted the possibility that British withdrawal from the EU could well be accompanied by special EU arrangements for some of the United Kingdom's constituent parts - not just Scotland but also Northern Ireland and Gibraltar.  \\\"They discussed possibly Scotland getting special status within the UK to let it still be a member of the EU somehow,\\\" an EU official who took part in one of Sturgeon's meetings said.  \\\"On the 'reverse Greenland' option, she wasn't trying to put it on the agenda. It was a genuine reflection.\\\"  Senior EU officials say they are in no mood now to do more than brainstorm, even if they sympathize with the plight of the pro-EU Scots. Brussels faces existential and legal nightmares to cut loose the bloc's second biggest economy and expects to wait months for a new British government even to start the process.  \\\"Scotland is a part of the UK,\\\" a spokesman for the European Commission said. \\\"All parts of the UK should sort out what they want to do,\\\" he added, calling the options \\\"speculation\\\".  WITHOUT INDEPENDENCE, OPTIONS OPEN  However, Sturgeon's trip to Brussels, on the very day the EU sat down without Britain to consider its options, showed leaders her determination to get a seat at the Brexit negotiating table.  Crucially for her charm offensive in a city that rebuffed Scots' appeals for assurances of EU membership during their 2014 independence referendum - a reflection of fears of secession in other EU states such as Spain - Sturgeon kept the secession card firmly off the table, insisting that was not the priority.  \\\"We do not come at it from the starting point of independence,\\\" she told reporters in Brussels. \\\"We come at it from the starting point of protecting Scotland's interests.\\\"  Another person familiar with one of her meetings said Sturgeon was told that Brussels did not want to be drawn into a battle inside Britain or offer a future independent Scotland any fast-track to EU membership - and she had not disputed that.  \\\"She did not use the Brexit\"}"
