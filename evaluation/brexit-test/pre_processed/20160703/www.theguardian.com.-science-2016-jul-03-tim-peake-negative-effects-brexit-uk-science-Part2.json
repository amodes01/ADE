They had obviously woken up together and decided to rush in. It was really lovely, a very special moment,\\\" he said. Since then, the couple have taken the boys to the local park near the Rhine and explained over ice-cream that Major Peake had not been aboard Han Solo's Millennium Falcon.  The first few months back on Earth are intense with rehabilitation and science experiments. In daily exercise sessions, Peake works out to rebuild the muscles he has lost in space. It takes a few days to regain a sense of balance, and until it returns, Peake said it feels like the worst hangover ever: move your head and you immediately feel sick and dizzy.  Once the sickness abates, the body needs more time to fine tune its senses. Peake said: \\\"I'd be walking down the street and turn my head to talk to someone next to me and just wander off the pavement into the road.\\\" He feels 100% now, but still has to take care not to pull any muscles. \\\"It's amazing how heavy the head is. Your neck muscles do work hard to support it again,\\\" he said.  Experiments take up the lion's share of Peake's daily routine. On Friday, he spent more than an hour in an MRI scanner. He has given blood samples and muscle biopsies, had tests on his eyes, cardiovascular system, and skin, to investigate how they age in space. He spent two nights hooked up to equipment that monitored his circadian rhythms to see how they differ before and after six months in space. He will soon head to Nasa's astronaut centre in Houston for more tests there.  Before he left the space station, he took time to cement his memories, a strategy other astronauts have used to say goodbye to the station. He misses the view of Earth from space, but also the constant daily challenges of the job and the team assembled around him.  Later this year, Peake will visit schools and tour the country to share his experiences of life in orbit. In the days before he landed, the bookies opened bets on Peake appearing on TV, with Strictly Come Dancing and Top Gear among the favourites.  Peake said: \\\"On Strictly, I'd say there is zero to no chance. I do not think I am ready to put myself through the embarrassment of sharing my dancing skills with the public. As for Top Gear, anything with an engine that goes fast I absolutely love, so I certainly would not turn down the opportunity.\\\"\"}"
