It cannot be midway. I remember this during Thappad also - that you put her on such a pedestal that it is difficult for her to be treated like a normal human being. I had to take help of a writer like Kanika (Dhillon) who wrote Manmarziyaan, who wrote Haseen Dillruba, and ended up doing those grey characters. So much so that now if I do too much of a white character - people will not accept it (laughs)!Which I am very happy about. I have no qualms about it. Like I said, I have missed that bus of doing the righteous, miss-goody-two-shoes kind of roles, but I am glad that this lane that I have chosen does not have many who are like that.Even the ones who I feel have the potential to be in this lane - probably they have still not settled the fact in their head that this is a good enough lane and a competitive enough lane to be a part of. They still think that to be that big Bollywood heroine the only raasta is the mainstream, classic way.Which wasn't your route. When I entered the Hindi film industry, I realised that there are far more good-looking women who are able to do that stuff (mainstream) very well. I can not compete with that. I decided I might as well push myself in another direction rather than force-pushing myself in these big commercial films where either I will not get through at all, or even if I get through it, it will be the leftover stuff. Now that I have kind of become a producer and I am trying to put together stuff, I have realised how even women in the industry think when they approach a subject. In interviews, they talk a lot about how there are not enough scripts or there are not enough people making such films\\u2026No, they do not, and I have seen this first hand, and so now my whole perspective has changed. There are a lot of things that I have learnt after becoming a producer.Oh, yeah, and it is also a mistake to assume that all men are not feminists. I have come across so many of them who are more feminist than probably I was. Feminism is not gender specific.\"}"
