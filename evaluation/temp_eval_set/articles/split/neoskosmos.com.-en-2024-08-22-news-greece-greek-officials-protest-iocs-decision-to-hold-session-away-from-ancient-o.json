"{\"uid\": \"neoskosmos.com.-en-2024-08-22-news-greece-greek-officials-protest-iocs-decision-to-hold-session-away-from-ancient-o\", \"text\": \"Tensions have arisen between officials in Ancient Olympia and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) over the decision to hold their next session in a neighbouring region of southern Greece, rather than in the birthplace of the Olympic Games.  Greek Olympic officials are protesting the session's location, arguing that they wish to include Ancient Olympia in the four-day meetings, despite its lack of facilities large enough to host the event.  The IOC session, scheduled for March next year, will be held in Greece, with its primary responsibility being to choose a successor to Thomas Bach, who is stepping down after serving as president since 2013.  Regional Governor Nektarios Farmakis expressed disappointment over the session's location, labeling it \\\"a missed opportunity for something significant.\\\"  Farmakis wrote in an online post: \\\"For all of us, the land of the Olympics, Ancient Olympia, is not just a museum of old values. It is a living place of deep spiritual significance, a beacon that draws visitors from all over the world.\\\"  The town's mayor and other local officials also publicly voiced their disappointment on Tuesday and Wednesday regarding the venue decision.  Details of the event have not yet been announced, though officials from the Hellenic Olympic Committee say the IOC session will be held at a coastal resort in the Messinia region, south of Ancient Olympia.  Ancient Olympia is the birthplace of the Olympic Games and the site where the Olympic flame lighting ceremony is held every two years.  *With AP\"}"
