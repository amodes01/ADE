The moment I put it on, I knew it was the one - it matched my vision perfectly,\\\" she recalls.  She was so in love with her dress that she decided to forgo making any outfit changes for the reception. \\\"[I wanted] to wear it for as long as I could!\\\" she says.  Blend Artistry Ohio oversaw her bridal hair and glam on the big day, while Susan Foy handled all the flowers.  Following the ceremony, the couple hosted a cocktail hour where guests nibbled from a stationed display of fruit, cheese and charcuterie, including imported prosciutto, capicola and mortadella, along with seasoned crostinis with goat cheese, olive tapenade, bruschetta, domestic and imported cheeses and a selection of seasonal and tropical fruits.  Dinner commenced with a mixed greens salad with sun-dried cranberries, goat cheese, toasted pecans and a raspberry vinaigrette, accompanied by warm rolls with whipped butter. For the main coarse, a carving station featured roasted beef tenderloin with horseradish mushroom demi-glace and creamy horseradish sauce, as well as chicken piccata in a lemon butter cream sauce with capers. Sides included aged cheddar mashed potatoes and roasted asparagus spears with fire-roasted red pepper pur\\u00e9e.    In a special touch, Foster and Wolf placed handwritten letters at each of their guests' seats at dinner. \\\"We wanted to express our heartfelt gratitude for all the love and support they have given us over the years,\\\" Wolf says.  The pair chose a carrot wedding cake with cream cheese frosting made by A Spoon Fulla Sugar. Later into the night, everyone refueled with sliders and tater tots.

When the dancing got underway at the reception, Foster and Wolf shared their first dance as husband and wife to an acoustic version of Jervis Campbell's \\\"Teach Me to Dance.\\\" DJ Jeff Heidelberg kept the party going with an \\\"incredible\\\" playlist of tunes.  \\\"A fun touch we added was light-up cowboy hats for the guests on the dance floor, bringing a bit of Austin, Texas, flair to Cincinnati,\\\" Wolf notes.  The day after the wedding, the newlyweds had one more special experience in store for their loved ones, when Foster was invited to throw out the first pitch at the Cincinnati Reds game against the Kansas City Royals.  \\\"Over 100 of our guests joined us [at the stadium] to unwind and celebrate,\\\" Wolf tells PEOPLE. \\\"This was one of our favorite moments of the weekend, allowing us to reminisce about the wedding and celebrate Carson's swimming achievements with all our cherished friends and family.\\\"  As they reminisce about their wedding, the couple says \\\"it was everything we could have hoped for and more,\\\" adding: \\\"The day and weekend were filled with joy as we celebrated the beginning of our lives together with those we love most.\\\"  The newlyweds, who first met in high school while swimming for the same club team, got engaged in August 2022. Now that they are married - and the Olympics are in the rear view - they say they are looking forward to a slower pace of life where they can spend more quality time together and with loved ones.
