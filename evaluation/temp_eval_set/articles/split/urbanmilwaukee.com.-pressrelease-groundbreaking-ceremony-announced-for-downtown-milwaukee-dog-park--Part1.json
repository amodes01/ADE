The official groundbreaking celebration for the Downtown Milwaukee Dog Park will take place Thursday, Sept. 5 at 3 p.m. The much-anticipated development is a collaborative effort led by Milwaukee Downtown, Business Improvement District #21 (BID #21) and the Historic Third Ward Business Improvement District #2 (BID #2), and is made possible by thousands of donors. Located at 103 W. Clybourn St., the project will be Downtown's first and only public dog park.  \\\"Since announcing plans for Downtown's first dog park at this underutilized space, excitement for the project has continued to grow,\\\" said, economic development director for Milwaukee Downtown, BID #21. \\\"Businesses of all sizes, philanthropic partners and thousands of residents have pledged their support for this vital amenity. While fundraising efforts continue, their enthusiasm for the project has brought us to this exciting juncture.\\\"  The Downtown Milwaukee Dog Park aims to provide a safe, enjoyable space for dog owners and their furry friends to socialize and exercise. The 22,000-square-foot park will include separately fenced areas for small and large dogs, water stations, upgraded lighting and other pet amenities, as well as prominent donor recognition and opportunities for community programming.  Fromm Family Pet Food, title sponsor of the project, has played a crucial role in bringing this project to life. The development of the dog park was instrumental in attracting Fromm to the adjacent parcel, where they are now developing the 28,000-square-foot Foxtown Landing brewery, distillery and restaurant. This new establishment, with its extensive outdoor spaces, will revitalize one of the few remaining unused parcels along the Milwaukee River. Additionally, the entire project will be connected to Downtown's pedestrian network by a new Riverwalk segment running from St. Paul Avenue to Clybourn Street.  \\\"We are thrilled to be the title sponsor of the Downtown Milwaukee Dog Park,\\\" said Tom Neiman, owner of Fromm Family Pet Food. \\\"As a family-owned business committed to the well-being of pets, we believe this new amenity will enhance the quality of life for both dogs and their owners in the community. We are delighted to be part of the upward momentum taking place in the greater Downtown area.\\\"  In addition to Fromm Family Pet Food, the project has garnered widespread support from a diverse group of sponsors and public sector partners. The project continues to attract new sponsors, including its most recent pack of supporters: the Milwaukee Admirals , Berghammer Construction, Veolia and Off Leash K9 Training, LLC. The project is also backed by thousands of individuals who have pledged support from across the region. Public sector partners include the Wisconsin Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration , Milwaukee County and the City of Milwaukee.  The Downtown Milwaukee Dog Park is the crown jewel in a series of projects that Milwaukee Downtown, BID #21 and the Historic Third Ward BID #2 have successfully undertaken to enhance connectivity between the two neighborhoods. A dog park is a long-overdue amenity for the Downtown area, and is sure to transform the corridor, which sits alongside one of the busiest entryways to Downtown and the Historic Third Ward.  \\\"The Downtown Milwaukee Dog Park area will be revitalized to meet the growing demands of our residents, employees and guests,\\\" said Paul Schwartz, executive director of the\"}"
