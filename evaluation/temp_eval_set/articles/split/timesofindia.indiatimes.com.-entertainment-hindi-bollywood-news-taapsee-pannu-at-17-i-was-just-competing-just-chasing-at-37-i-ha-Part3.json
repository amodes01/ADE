I really feel happy that I am this age. They also give me roles which they say are aged 28 - which is supposed to be a golden number, apparently.There are a lot of girls who are not okay with the script saying this character is 32 or 33. And they are like why can not it be 28? And I am like how does it make a difference kyunki screen pe koi bol nahi raha hai tumhari age. It is in your head ki you are 28 or 32.But I feel I have a better grip over my character if it's in the 30s because I kind of knew myself better when I was in 30s than in 20s. Because 20s mein hustling hi itni zyada chal rahi thi ki I was like a headless chicken - achha abhi south mein ho gaya, abhi Hindi mein aana hai, next kya karna hai, main ye nahi kar sakti, mujhe woh mil nahi raha hai. With so much going on, I did not have the frame of mind to sit down and realise ki hota kya hai ye 20s? It just went in hustling - I did not enjoy them.Even on screen, I never got to play someone in 20s.It's not like that has gone away. It's there even now. There are so many times that actresses are not chosen opposite certain stars saying that iski screen age zyada lagti hai. That's what happened to me in those early years. I took an opportunity to star opposite big stars, thinking it's a big film, only to fall into the trap and realise that younger stars now do not want to work with me.Now, of course, my trajectory is such that it does not really matter to me anymore. But even now, the big so-called young superstars who are 40+ do not want to star opposite girls who are 30+. They themselves might not be young, but they want younger girls opposite them.It does not affect me as much it affected me 10 years back. Now I just laugh at it - how frivolous and shallow it is.No. Regret is too heavy a word. But yeah, I miss having those rom-coms in my kitty where I could look like a college girl and dance around. Last I tried to do it in Judwaa 2 (2017), when I was 30. And people just could not digest it at that point. They were like, 'No, you have gone too far in a different direction. It's awkward to see you like that (laughs).' So, yeah, I lost out on that.Actresses try to do the fun, younger stuff first. I did not have that option, so I had to take the heavy lifting stuff first and then there was point of no return.Maybe Vidya ke saath bhi yehi hua hoga, maybe Tabu ke saath bhi yehi hua hoga.You know, not just writing, I am telling you from the other side, because I have a script - which is about this mid-30s woman who falls in love with a much younger boy. And you will not believe it, the problem is the people who are financing it. Ek major platform se toh we got a mandate like - how is this even right? Because a mid-30s woman - she was married and had a kid with someone else, and later on, shefalls in love with someone else. It was rejected on ethical grounds. That this is just so not right! And imagine an OTT platform telling you that right now. Theatre ki toh hum abhi baat hi nahi karenge.I remember there was a proper upmarket woman - like the mother of someone who's my age - who, after seeing Manmarziyaan said to me, 'But that was wrong, haan. What the character did with Abhishek Bachchan (his character). Itna achha aadmi tha. Shaadi karne ke baad why did your character go back to Vicky Kaushal's character?'Matlab, even women will not see a woman as a normal human being who can make mistakes. She should always be projected and presented like a devi. There are the\"}"
