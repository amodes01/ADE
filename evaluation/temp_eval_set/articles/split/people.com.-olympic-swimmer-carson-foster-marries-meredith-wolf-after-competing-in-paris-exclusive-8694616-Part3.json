Amanda Donaho | @amandadonahophotography  \\\"The past few months have been a whirlwind of incredible and surreal experiences, from the Olympic trials and the Olympics to our wedding. We would not trade a single moment of it and are deeply grateful for every experience. However, I think we both agree that we are ready for a bit of a slowdown,\\\" Wolf explains. \\\"We are looking forward to savoring more relaxed weekends in Austin, cheering on the Longhorns, spending quality time with our friends, and getting a dog.\\\"  As Foster reflected on their journey as a couple, he shared his excitement about having Wolf by his side as his wife.  \\\"Getting married to Meredith means finally announcing for good that I get to start a family and a lifelong journey with the person who has been my best friend since I was 15 years old,\\\" the athlete tells PEOPLE, gushing that her special qualities are too long to list. \\\"She has remained the same wonderful person from the days when we first started dating at 15 to now. That unwavering constancy is the greatest gift I could ever ask for in a partner.\\\"  From Left: Meredith Wolf and Carson Foster. Amanda Donaho | @amandadonahophotography  As for Wolf, she calls marrying Foster \\\"truly the greatest honor\\\" of her life.  \\\"Over the past seven years, we have grown together and navigated so many experiences side by side. During our college years, we endured the challenges of a long-distance relationship - me at the University of South Carolina and Carson at the University of Texas. There were days when the distance felt overwhelming, but now marriage signifies the beginning of our forever,\\\" she says.  \\\"We are excited to embark on this new chapter of living life fully as a couple,\\\" Wolf adds. \\\"Carson is not only my best friend but also my home; wherever he is, that's where I want to be.\\\"\"}"
