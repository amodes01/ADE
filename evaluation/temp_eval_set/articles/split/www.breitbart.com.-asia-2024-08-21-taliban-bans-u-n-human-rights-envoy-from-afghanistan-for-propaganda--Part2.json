The junta now insists its treatment of women is consistent with Islamic law and rejects all criticism of its oppressive tactics.  Supreme Leader Hibatullah Akhundzada claimed in 2023 that Taliban rule has provided Afghan women with a \\\"comfortable and prosperous life according to Islamic Sharia.\\\"  Bennett responded to the Taliban banning him on Tuesday by advising the U.N. Human Rights Council to send a \\\"message\\\" that the \\\"abysmal treatment of women and girls is intolerable and unjustifiable on any ground, including religion.\\\"  \\\"The cumulative effect of the restrictions on women and girls has a devastating, long-term impact on the whole population, and it is tantamount to gender apartheid,\\\" he declared.  The office of U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres did not acknowledge or criticize the Taliban ban on Bennett. Instead, a Guterres spokesman merely insisted that \\\"special rapporteurs play a very critical part in the global human rights architecture,\\\" so all states should fully cooperate with them.\"}"
