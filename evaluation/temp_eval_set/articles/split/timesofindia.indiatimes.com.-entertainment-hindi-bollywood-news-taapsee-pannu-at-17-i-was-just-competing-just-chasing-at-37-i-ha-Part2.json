My time is very precious. And my mental state is very precious to me. So I have started protecting myself in terms of who I expose my mind or myself to. I do not want to lose my vulnerability by trying to build a wall and be the template type for everyone just because that's what sells or that's how you should be. I do not want to get affected very easily.Yes, yes. One of my reasons to become an actor was not to do a 9-5 job. Now if I start building a wall, then it will start feeling like a 9-5 job. You are always second-guessing the intention of the person sitting across you - which is just occupying too much of my mindspace when I have so many other things in my life to do, things that are not only about my image or my work. So I started protecting myself. I decided that now, I am going to expose my mind or my ideas to only people who I know are safe spaces. That is why I have (in) the last couple of years stopped talking to a lot of people. I kind of do not go out and be seen just because 'jo dikhta hai woh bikta hai'.I have stopped running the race of being the most seen, the most viewed - the search for the superlative adjective, mera ab khatam ho gaya hai. I have realised nothing is the 'most'. No matter where you reach, there will always be people above and below you. There is no point in running that stupid race. I want to enjoy the time I have here rather than always trying to run behind a milestone- and then reaching there and probably realising 'oh abhi toh kuch aur aa gaya hai'. It's never gonna end in this profession.Every way. I think I have much more control over my mind. It's not as easy to trigger me now as it was probably at 17. Age se hi fark padta hai woh.17 pe it will be very easy to trigger someone. Now, obviously, people can still continue to be like that. But that is the difference in me. Uss time toh I was like the majority, but now I feel it's not easy to trigger me because I kind of started to see things from a perspective. Does it even matter in the long run? Why am I investing my effort and time on this right now? And I realised there is nothing called coming first anymore. It's about whether you are really happy while doing what you are doing every day.Otherwise, I was just chasing, I was just competing in everything. Competing at getting maximum attendance to scoring maximum to winning the most number of accolades to all these competitive exams where you are given rankings. All these things, they have changed now. And I think a clarity of priorities has now come to me - it had in fact started coming to me as my 30s started.My 20s went in coming to terms with the fact that I have become an actor. I was wrapping my head around this profession. Meri life mein most things have happened late - compared to what I see girls doing now. Though I have no regret. I am so glad I completed my education properly. Then I started from scratch. I went south and learnt a new language. I am glad that I went through the drill because it kind of honed my patience and my tolerance.Most of my contemporaries - not contemporaries, they are actually relatively junior - they start in their teens. Either they have been made to go into this profession or they do not know any better, so everything happens very early.Main jab 30s mein pahunchi toh maine realise kiya ki - I did not even realise where my 20s went. Like when I started off in the Hindi film industry, I was probably in mid-20s already, which is late for a lot of girls to start. I\"}"
