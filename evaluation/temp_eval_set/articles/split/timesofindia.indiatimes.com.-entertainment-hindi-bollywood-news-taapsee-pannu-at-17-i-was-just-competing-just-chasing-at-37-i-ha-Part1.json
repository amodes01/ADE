You turned 37 this year. Many years back, Vidya (Balan) had said in an interview to us that 'at 34, I feel much more confident than I was at 17 - I do not miss the younger years, I do not regret ageing.' Is the sentiment the same with you?  This comes with contradictions, does not it? Building a complete wall changes your personality. But being unguarded lets people walk all over you. You find your mid points, your windows in the walls?  I have a better grip over my character if it's in the 30s: Taapsee  When I entered the Hindi film industry, I realised that there are far more good-looking women who are able to do that stuff (mainstream) very well. I decided I might as well push myself in another direction rather than force-pushing myself in commercial films Taapsee Pannu  In what ways are you at 37 different from what you were at, say, 17?  But there is no guarantee of age equals maturity, is there?  Taapsee caught the attention of the audience and the industry with her role in Baby (2015), when she was 27  \\\"The 30s\\\" is a tricky space - so much is written about it on social media. For many, hitting 30 is like 'the best years are after me now', that sort of sentiment. There is also the age-related stereotyping in industries such as showbiz. How did you handle the 30s transition in an industry where everything is so magnified, literally, wrinkles and beyond?  The 20 to 30 transition was therefore mostly accepting ki haan, now I know where I am and what I am doing.  Kyunki when I came here, I did not have an option but to take up the more serious parts because there were other relatively younger or relatively more popular girls who were doing my age wale parts. By the time I became popular and influential enough, I had lost that 25-26-year-old space. I had crossed 30. Now, I am too old to do the parts that I really wanted to do when I was 25-26. I was forced to get older roles because those were the only parts open for someone like me. And now, I do not have an option. I do not really know also how much I can add to a character in her 20s because the twenties have changed so much from 10 years back, when I was that age.  I was paired opposite people almost double my age in my south career. So much so, that there was a point I remember when an actor - who was my age or a year or two older - refused to star opposite me and said no, she looks older than me. Because I had worked with actors who were older to him. So, for him, I was older. So, my age was actually defined by my co-actors who I work with!  No regrets, though?  Taapsee with Varun Dhawan in Judwaa 2 (2017)  My question is why do we wait for these actresses to turn so called middle-aged to realise how relevant they are when they have been consistently doing that level of work?  Our love stories actually do not give much space to older women in the way they are written, do they?  Taapsee's role in Manmarziyaan (2018) did not sit well with some women due to the choices her character made in the movie  Even women will not see a woman as a normal human being who can make mistakes. She should always be projected and presented like a devi. There are the two Ds - Devi or Daayan. It cannot be midway Taapsee Pannu  \\u2026but when such scripts come, they do not take it?  I may well be wrong, because I am the wrong gender to say this - but is it a mistake to assume that all women are feminists?  Yeah, yeah, same here.I 100% agree. Mere profession ki demand aisi rehti hai ki tum\"}"
