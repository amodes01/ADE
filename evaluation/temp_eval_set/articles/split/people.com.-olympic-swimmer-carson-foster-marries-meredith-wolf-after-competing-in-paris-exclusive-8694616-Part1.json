Fresh off competing in the Summer Olympics in Paris, the 22-year-old athlete married his high school sweetheart, Meredith Wolf, on Friday, Aug. 16, at The Monastery Event Center in their hometown of Cincinnati. They invited 220 guests to witness their big day, among them eight of Foster's fellow Olympians: Drew Kibler, Gretchen Walsh, Alex Walsh, Shaine Casas, Charlie Swanson, Kieran Smith, David Johnston and Caspar Corbeau.  The couple, who lives in Austin, Texas, tells PEOPLE they could not imagine tying the knot anywhere other than the Queen City. \\\"Carson and I both grew up in Cincinnati, where most of our family still resides. No matter where life takes us, Cincinnati will always be considered home,\\\" Wolf says. \\\"We love bragging about our hometown, and it's a joy to share the unique charm and warmth of Cincinnati with our friends.\\\"  From Left: Meredith Wolf and Carson Foster. Amanda Donaho | @amandadonahophotography  Despite setting a wedding date that fell days after the Olympics concluded, the pair found the planning process to be \\\"remarkably smooth.\\\"  \\\"The timing of the Olympics - and our 10-day trip to Paris just before the wedding - motivated us to finalize most of the details beforehand,\\\" Wolf explains. \\\"While the weeks leading up to Paris were a bit stressful, this preparation allowed us to be fully present during wedding week and to truly enjoy the time with all our loved ones who came to celebrate with us.\\\"  Foster praised his now-wife and their respective mothers for taking much of the load from his shoulders, allowing him to focus on his training and competing. \\\"[They] were the wedding planning MVPs. The lead-up to the Olympic trials and the Olympics is a bit stressful, and they were incredible at delegating me tasks that were easy and things to get my mind off swimming but also taking on the big projects and allowing me to continue to focus on my swimming,\\\" he recalls.  Foster says he appreciated the distractions that wedding planning brought amid his rigorous swimming schedule. \\\"Planning the wedding to happen right after these meets was the best thing I could have asked for because throughout the stresses of the meets, I kept reminding myself the best and biggest things come in August in Cincinnati,\\\" he tells PEOPLE.  The couple's wedding festivities kicked off with a bridal party brunch and pool party at Wolf's childhood home on Thursday. \\\"We enjoyed cooking on the Blackstone grill and sipping mimosas,\\\" she says.
