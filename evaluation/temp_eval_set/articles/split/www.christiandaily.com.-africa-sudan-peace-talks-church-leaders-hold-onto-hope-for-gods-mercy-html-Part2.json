Some of the churches have been bombed and the danger of new attacks is vivid. In mid-August 2024, the city's Christian community attempted to gather in small congregations, Rani tells. However, this too proved difficult.  \\\"One church managed to organize a meeting, cleaned the church and collected the people from their homes with a bus to avoid the danger of the streets,\\\" Youssef recounts. The first meeting was a success, but on the second attempt, the bus was halted by the Sudanese Army.  \\\"They sent the people home, saying it was too dangerous to hold a congregation,\\\" Youssef explains. He adds that the incident is an example of how efforts to rebuild life are swiftly undone and brief moments of normality are quickly crushed.  Despite the dire situation, Youssef does not let hope be shattered. His greatest worry is the suffering of people already on the brink of starvation. The United Nations' World Food Program warns that approximately 8.5 million people are facing extreme food shortages, with the risk of famine looming if the conflict escalates further. The war has claimed nearly 16,000 lives, displaced millions, and triggered a catastrophic humanitarian crisis.  Youssef continues to pay his clinic staff's salaries and remains in touch with those still in Khartoum. He observes that the prices for basic goods have skyrocketed alongside the destruction wrought by the RSF. \\\"Fruits are now a luxury,\\\" he says, noting that sugar is a rare commodity for many. The infrastructure, painstakingly built over decades, lies in ruins, and with scant support for reconstruction, recovery will be a long and arduous process.  What troubles Youssef most, however, is the deafening silence surrounding this devastation. A joint report by 21 Christian humanitarian organizations listed Sudan as one of the six crisis-hit African countries that have been neglected by the international community.  \\\"What really kills me is that despite all this suffering, nobody talks about it,\\\" wonders Youssef. He believes that the conflict has spiraled beyond human control. \\\"It really needs God's hand, God's mercy. Prayer is the only thing that will change this,\\\" he asserts. He places his faith in divine intervention over NGO projects or peace talks, hoping for a resolution that seems increasingly distant.\"}"
