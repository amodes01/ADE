Then along came Veronica Campbell-Brown, who won eight Olympic medals, including three golds, over a stretch that covered 2004-16.  In the weeks before the 2008 Beijing Games, vitriol flew at the then-21-year-old newcomer, who then went by Shelly-Ann Fraser, from those who believed the spot she captured in the 100 was depriving Jamaica and \\\"VCB\\\" a sure medal.  Fraser won gold that year and again in 2012. She won eight medals and became one of Jamaica's all-time greats over the span of four Olympics before this year.  If the next Fraser is out there, she has not arrived yet, though Thompson's relatively quick emergence on the men's side - he was a virtual unknown outside the island before June - shows how fast things can change.  Even Usain Bolt started slowly at his first Olympics  Remember this: Four years before he became an international celebrity, Bolt made his Olympic debut in the 200 meters in Athens. He went out quietly in the first round.  Four years later, though, the 6-foot-5 force of nature turned the Olympic track into his own personal stage - 9-point-something seconds of running followed by a reggae-filled, dance-fest and capped off by his iconic bow-and-arrow victory pose.  At times during this Olympic track meet, it has felt like more than eight years have passed since Bolt reigned supreme. But Powell remains hopeful.  \\\"We will see Jamaica celebrating again,\\\" he said. \\\"Jamaicans have the best celebration so the world wants to see it.\\\"  ___  AP Summer Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games\"}"
