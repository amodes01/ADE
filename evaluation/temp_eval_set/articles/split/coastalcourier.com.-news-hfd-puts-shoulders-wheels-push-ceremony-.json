"{\"uid\": \"coastalcourier.com.-news-hfd-puts-shoulders-wheels-push-ceremony-\", \"text\": \"It's a time-honored tradition for fire fighters to push new vehicles into their bays.  In the old days, Chief Robert Kitchings said, because the pumpers were horse drawn - and there is not a reverse gear with horses - the pumpers were uncoupled from the horse teams and stowed into their bays with brute force.  The two new beasts now inside Hinesville's fire stations are a rescue pumper and what is known as a quint, part pumper and engine and part ladder truck, with a 75-foot ladder.  \\\"These specifically meet the needs of our city and our citizens,\\\" Chief Kitchings said.  The quint was purchased with help from Flemington's impact fees, since Hinesville's fire department also provides coverage to Flemington homes and businesses.  \\\"We would not have been able to get it without the partnership the city has with the City of Flemington,\\\" Kitchings said.  The HFD has gotten three new trucks in two years, after not getting any new trucks for 11 years. Kitchings said he and assistant chief Andy Fowler are appreciative of the support from city administration and city council.    The vehicles also were purchased with special local option sales tax proceeds, Kitchings said. The new trucks also allow the department to expand its coverage as the city continues to grow.  \\\"Any time you ride through (Hinesville), you know you are protected by the best fire department in the state of Georgia,\\\" he said. \\\"We will continue to provide the best service in the state of Georgia.\\\"  Photos by Pat Donahue.\"}"
