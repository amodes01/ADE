In June 2024, a Russian court rejected a request by Roskomnadzor, the Russian telecommunications regulator, to suspend the licences of RIA FAN, Narodnye Novosti and Ekonomika Segodnya, three of his flagship media outlets, which were closed in the summer of 2023 and were due to have been liquidated in the spring of 2024.  According to a report in Fontanka.ru, an independent media outlet based in Saint Petersburg, the legal entities of these three media outlets are frozen but they still exist and the funding of their domain names is assured for a few more months. Talks were recently held with Prigozhin's son and heir, Pavel Prigozhin, about reviving them without a final decision being taken.  Prigozhin's former acolytes are waging a fierce battle to be sole master of disinformation. The ruling saving the three flagship media outlets from the chopping block came a few days after the arrest of Ilya Gorbunov, a propagandist and top manager at the Patriot Media Group , a Prigozhin-owned holding that was dissolved in the summer of 2023. Gorbunov is accused of \\\" extortion \\\" by Alexander Malkevich, a onetime Prigozhin employee and close friend who has developed a Kremlin propaganda network in the Ukrainian territories occupied by Russia since February 2022.  Chief propagandist in occupied Ukraine  Malkevich , who says he distanced himself from Prigozhin in 2021 after spending part of his career in a close relationship with the Wagner Group , has retained his role as chief propagandis t in Ukraine's occupied territories. Trained in Prigozhin \\\"methods,\\\" Malkevich is particularly active on social media and often draws attention to himself by posting \\\"recommendations\\\" for \\\"journalists\\\" in the occupied territories, participating in youth forums in these territories and interviewing local \\\"authorities.\\\"  After Russia launched its invasion in 2022, Malkevich founded propaganda media in the occupied southeastern regions of Ukraine, including as Mariupol 24 in Mariupol, Tavria TV in Kherson - which was occupied until November 2022 - and the ZaMedia group in Melitopol , which includes a TV channel, a radio station, and several local newspapers. These propaganda outlets have never stopped disseminating the Kremlin's narrative, systematically portraying the Russian occupation as a \\\"liberation,\\\" broadcasting calls to join the Russian armed forces, and covering Vladimir Putin's every move.  Wanted by US and Ukrainian justice  Malkevich's \\\"Wagner-style\\\" propaganda system has not gone unnoticed. The US Department of States is offering a reward of up to 10 million US dollars (about 9 million euros) for information leading to Malkevich's \\\"location or identification\\\" for engaging in interference in US elections.  A faithful relay of Moscow's propaganda who has specialised in supporting the Russian disinformation empire among local populations in Ukraine's occupied territories, Malkevich often recruits young Ukrainians living under occupation for his propaganda media. But the justice system in free Ukraine has turned its sights on some of his young collaborators. They  include Oleksandr Yakymets, a 19-year-old Ukrainian propagandist working for the Mariupol 24 TV channel, who has been under investigation since January 2024 for \\\"collaboration,\\\" and Ihor Belinsky, the channel's editing director, who has been the subject of \\\"collaboration\\\" proceedings since May 2024 .\"}"
