"{\"uid\": \"northafricapost.com.-79681-kabyle-independence-leader-slams-algerias-terrorism-accusations-reaffirms-peaceful-struggle-h\", \"text\": \"Head of the Kabylie independence movement MAK, Ferhat Mhenni, rejected the recent recycled accusation of terrorism used by the Algerian regime to crackdown on independence activists at home.  In an interview with le360, Mhenni- who is based in exile in Paris- highlighted the peaceful character of the Kabyle independence struggle as scores are being jailed in his homeland on bogus charges.  Accusing the MAK of terrorism amid an electoral campaign by president Tebboune is another distraction tactic to further stigmatize the breakaway Kabylie region and its people, he said.  The Algerian authorities recently claimed to have thwarted a MAK terrorist plot and seized weapons, which Mehenni vehemently denies, reaffirming MAK's commitment to non-violence.  The Algerian military regime has been scapegoating the Kabylie region accusing the MAK of complicity with Morocco, France and Israel, in order to deflect the attention of the Algerian people away from self-inflicted problems, he said.  Several human rights watchdogs have denounced the use by the Algerian authorities of fabricated terrorism charges to silence journalists, human rights defenders, political activists, and peaceful pro-democracy protesters.  In 2021, the authorities amended the definition of \\\"terrorism\\\" to allow the prosecution of peaceful activists and critical voices.  The same year, he Algerian High Security Council labelled MAK and another opposition movement Rachad as \\\"terrorist\\\" entities. Since then, dozens of individuals have been arrested and prosecuted under terrorism charges for their alleged ties to the two organizations.  Leaders of both movements are based in European countries, who have ignored the Algerian terrorism charges as unfounded.\"}"
