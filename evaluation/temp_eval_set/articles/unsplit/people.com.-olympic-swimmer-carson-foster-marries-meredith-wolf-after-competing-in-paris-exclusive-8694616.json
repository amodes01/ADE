Fresh off competing in the Summer Olympics in Paris, the 22-year-old athlete married his high school sweetheart, Meredith Wolf, on Friday, Aug. 16, at The Monastery Event Center in their hometown of Cincinnati. They invited 220 guests to witness their big day, among them eight of Foster's fellow Olympians: Drew Kibler, Gretchen Walsh, Alex Walsh, Shaine Casas, Charlie Swanson, Kieran Smith, David Johnston and Caspar Corbeau.  The couple, who lives in Austin, Texas, tells PEOPLE they could not imagine tying the knot anywhere other than the Queen City. \\\"Carson and I both grew up in Cincinnati, where most of our family still resides. No matter where life takes us, Cincinnati will always be considered home,\\\" Wolf says. \\\"We love bragging about our hometown, and it's a joy to share the unique charm and warmth of Cincinnati with our friends.\\\"  From Left: Meredith Wolf and Carson Foster. Amanda Donaho | @amandadonahophotography  Despite setting a wedding date that fell days after the Olympics concluded, the pair found the planning process to be \\\"remarkably smooth.\\\"  \\\"The timing of the Olympics - and our 10-day trip to Paris just before the wedding - motivated us to finalize most of the details beforehand,\\\" Wolf explains. \\\"While the weeks leading up to Paris were a bit stressful, this preparation allowed us to be fully present during wedding week and to truly enjoy the time with all our loved ones who came to celebrate with us.\\\"  Foster praised his now-wife and their respective mothers for taking much of the load from his shoulders, allowing him to focus on his training and competing. \\\"[They] were the wedding planning MVPs. The lead-up to the Olympic trials and the Olympics is a bit stressful, and they were incredible at delegating me tasks that were easy and things to get my mind off swimming but also taking on the big projects and allowing me to continue to focus on my swimming,\\\" he recalls.  Foster says he appreciated the distractions that wedding planning brought amid his rigorous swimming schedule. \\\"Planning the wedding to happen right after these meets was the best thing I could have asked for because throughout the stresses of the meets, I kept reminding myself the best and biggest things come in August in Cincinnati,\\\" he tells PEOPLE.  The couple's wedding festivities kicked off with a bridal party brunch and pool party at Wolf's childhood home on Thursday. \\\"We enjoyed cooking on the Blackstone grill and sipping mimosas,\\\" she says.

That evening, Wolf, Foster and their close friends and family gathered for a rehearsal dinner at a local restaurant called Alcove. \\\"It was a heartwarming evening filled with stories and memories, setting the perfect tone for the wedding day,\\\" Wolf notes. \\\"After dinner and speeches, we welcomed additional guests for a mini welcome party at the venue, creating a joyful start to the weekend.\\\"  On Friday, the couple exchanged vows during a traditional ceremony officiated by DJ Giaritelli, a close friend who served as a mentor for Foster during his college years at the University of Texas at Austin.

Amanda Donaho | @amandadonahophotography  Wolf walked down the aisle to \\\"Hallelujah,\\\" performed by the three-piece string quartet String Source, wearing a strapless Alexandra Grecco gown called the Sloan, which featured a structured bodice and trumpet-style skirt and train. \\\"I knew I wanted a simple, timeless dress with minimal details. The moment I put it on, I knew it was the one - it matched my vision perfectly,\\\" she recalls.  She was so in love with her dress that she decided to forgo making any outfit changes for the reception. \\\"[I wanted] to wear it for as long as I could!\\\" she says.  Blend Artistry Ohio oversaw her bridal hair and glam on the big day, while Susan Foy handled all the flowers.  Following the ceremony, the couple hosted a cocktail hour where guests nibbled from a stationed display of fruit, cheese and charcuterie, including imported prosciutto, capicola and mortadella, along with seasoned crostinis with goat cheese, olive tapenade, bruschetta, domestic and imported cheeses and a selection of seasonal and tropical fruits.  Dinner commenced with a mixed greens salad with sun-dried cranberries, goat cheese, toasted pecans and a raspberry vinaigrette, accompanied by warm rolls with whipped butter. For the main coarse, a carving station featured roasted beef tenderloin with horseradish mushroom demi-glace and creamy horseradish sauce, as well as chicken piccata in a lemon butter cream sauce with capers. Sides included aged cheddar mashed potatoes and roasted asparagus spears with fire-roasted red pepper pur\\u00e9e.    In a special touch, Foster and Wolf placed handwritten letters at each of their guests' seats at dinner. \\\"We wanted to express our heartfelt gratitude for all the love and support they have given us over the years,\\\" Wolf says.  The pair chose a carrot wedding cake with cream cheese frosting made by A Spoon Fulla Sugar. Later into the night, everyone refueled with sliders and tater tots.

When the dancing got underway at the reception, Foster and Wolf shared their first dance as husband and wife to an acoustic version of Jervis Campbell's \\\"Teach Me to Dance.\\\" DJ Jeff Heidelberg kept the party going with an \\\"incredible\\\" playlist of tunes.  \\\"A fun touch we added was light-up cowboy hats for the guests on the dance floor, bringing a bit of Austin, Texas, flair to Cincinnati,\\\" Wolf notes.  The day after the wedding, the newlyweds had one more special experience in store for their loved ones, when Foster was invited to throw out the first pitch at the Cincinnati Reds game against the Kansas City Royals.  \\\"Over 100 of our guests joined us [at the stadium] to unwind and celebrate,\\\" Wolf tells PEOPLE. \\\"This was one of our favorite moments of the weekend, allowing us to reminisce about the wedding and celebrate Carson's swimming achievements with all our cherished friends and family.\\\"  As they reminisce about their wedding, the couple says \\\"it was everything we could have hoped for and more,\\\" adding: \\\"The day and weekend were filled with joy as we celebrated the beginning of our lives together with those we love most.\\\"  The newlyweds, who first met in high school while swimming for the same club team, got engaged in August 2022. Now that they are married - and the Olympics are in the rear view - they say they are looking forward to a slower pace of life where they can spend more quality time together and with loved ones.    Center: Carson Foster and Meredith Wolf. Amanda Donaho | @amandadonahophotography  \\\"The past few months have been a whirlwind of incredible and surreal experiences, from the Olympic trials and the Olympics to our wedding. We would not trade a single moment of it and are deeply grateful for every experience. However, I think we both agree that we are ready for a bit of a slowdown,\\\" Wolf explains. \\\"We are looking forward to savoring more relaxed weekends in Austin, cheering on the Longhorns, spending quality time with our friends, and getting a dog.\\\"  As Foster reflected on their journey as a couple, he shared his excitement about having Wolf by his side as his wife.  \\\"Getting married to Meredith means finally announcing for good that I get to start a family and a lifelong journey with the person who has been my best friend since I was 15 years old,\\\" the athlete tells PEOPLE, gushing that her special qualities are too long to list. \\\"She has remained the same wonderful person from the days when we first started dating at 15 to now. That unwavering constancy is the greatest gift I could ever ask for in a partner.\\\"  From Left: Meredith Wolf and Carson Foster. Amanda Donaho | @amandadonahophotography  As for Wolf, she calls marrying Foster \\\"truly the greatest honor\\\" of her life.  \\\"Over the past seven years, we have grown together and navigated so many experiences side by side. During our college years, we endured the challenges of a long-distance relationship - me at the University of South Carolina and Carson at the University of Texas. There were days when the distance felt overwhelming, but now marriage signifies the beginning of our forever,\\\" she says.  \\\"We are excited to embark on this new chapter of living life fully as a couple,\\\" Wolf adds. \\\"Carson is not only my best friend but also my home; wherever he is, that's where I want to be.\\\"  \"}"
