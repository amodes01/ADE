Relevo are reporting that Barca are still trying to add signings, despite their financial complications, and are considering Pubill as a back-up option at right-back.  Pubill was part of Spain's successful Olympic squad, along with Eric Garcia, Pau Cubarsi and Fermin Lopez, that won gold at the Paris Games this summer.  The defender was set to join Atalanta this summer but a deal worth \\u20ac15 million fixed plus \\u20ac5m in variables fell through due to medical concerns.  Barcelona are said to be considering a deal on the same terms, and Pubill would be more than happy to head to Catalunya.  The news comes amid uncertainty still over the right-back slot at Barcelona for the new season.  Joao Cancelo's future is still unclear but looks to lie away from Barcelona, while Julian Araujo has left for Bournemouth.  Manager Hansi Flick is therefore left with Jules Kounde and Hector Fort as his current options.\"}"
