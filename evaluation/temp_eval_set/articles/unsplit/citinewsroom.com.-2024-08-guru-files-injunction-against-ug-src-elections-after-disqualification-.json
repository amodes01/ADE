The disqualification was based on Guru's non-resident status, a violation of Article 30, which mandates that candidates must be campus residents and eligible to contest for a Junior Common Room (JCR) position in their hall.  During vetting, Guru and his running mate, Jeffery Adu Yeboah, confirmed that they were not residents of any hall, leading to their disqualification.  In response, Guru's legal team has lodged a petition with the Electoral Commission and the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs, seeking a review of the decision.  Additionally, an interim injunction has been submitted to the Judicial Board, requesting a temporary halt to the electoral process until a proper hearing and ruling can be made.  \\\"We shall ensure that there is no discrimination towards any student, whether resident or non-resident, able or with special needs, first Degree or PFD, Local or International, Korle-Bu, City Campus or Distance education, including all the Regional Learning Centers across the length and breadth of the country\\\". He stated  The Hiplife icon remains confident that the Judicial Board will grant a fair hearing and deliver a just outcome.\"}"
