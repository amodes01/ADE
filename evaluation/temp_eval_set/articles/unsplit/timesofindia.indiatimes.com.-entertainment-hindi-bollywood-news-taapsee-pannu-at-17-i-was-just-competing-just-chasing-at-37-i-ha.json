You turned 37 this year. Many years back, Vidya (Balan) had said in an interview to us that 'at 34, I feel much more confident than I was at 17 - I do not miss the younger years, I do not regret ageing.' Is the sentiment the same with you?  This comes with contradictions, does not it? Building a complete wall changes your personality. But being unguarded lets people walk all over you. You find your mid points, your windows in the walls?  I have a better grip over my character if it's in the 30s: Taapsee  When I entered the Hindi film industry, I realised that there are far more good-looking women who are able to do that stuff (mainstream) very well. I decided I might as well push myself in another direction rather than force-pushing myself in commercial films Taapsee Pannu  In what ways are you at 37 different from what you were at, say, 17?  But there is no guarantee of age equals maturity, is there?  Taapsee caught the attention of the audience and the industry with her role in Baby (2015), when she was 27  \\\"The 30s\\\" is a tricky space - so much is written about it on social media. For many, hitting 30 is like 'the best years are after me now', that sort of sentiment. There is also the age-related stereotyping in industries such as showbiz. How did you handle the 30s transition in an industry where everything is so magnified, literally, wrinkles and beyond?  The 20 to 30 transition was therefore mostly accepting ki haan, now I know where I am and what I am doing.  Kyunki when I came here, I did not have an option but to take up the more serious parts because there were other relatively younger or relatively more popular girls who were doing my age wale parts. By the time I became popular and influential enough, I had lost that 25-26-year-old space. I had crossed 30. Now, I am too old to do the parts that I really wanted to do when I was 25-26. I was forced to get older roles because those were the only parts open for someone like me. And now, I do not have an option. I do not really know also how much I can add to a character in her 20s because the twenties have changed so much from 10 years back, when I was that age.  I was paired opposite people almost double my age in my south career. So much so, that there was a point I remember when an actor - who was my age or a year or two older - refused to star opposite me and said no, she looks older than me. Because I had worked with actors who were older to him. So, for him, I was older. So, my age was actually defined by my co-actors who I work with!  No regrets, though?  Taapsee with Varun Dhawan in Judwaa 2 (2017)  My question is why do we wait for these actresses to turn so called middle-aged to realise how relevant they are when they have been consistently doing that level of work?  Our love stories actually do not give much space to older women in the way they are written, do they?  Taapsee's role in Manmarziyaan (2018) did not sit well with some women due to the choices her character made in the movie  Even women will not see a woman as a normal human being who can make mistakes. She should always be projected and presented like a devi. There are the two Ds - Devi or Daayan. It cannot be midway Taapsee Pannu  \\u2026but when such scripts come, they do not take it?  I may well be wrong, because I am the wrong gender to say this - but is it a mistake to assume that all women are feminists?  Yeah, yeah, same here.I 100% agree. Mere profession ki demand aisi rehti hai ki tum regularly accessible raho, ya regularly media se baat karte raho, but I have a life beyond films. My time is very precious. And my mental state is very precious to me. So I have started protecting myself in terms of who I expose my mind or myself to. I do not want to lose my vulnerability by trying to build a wall and be the template type for everyone just because that's what sells or that's how you should be. I do not want to get affected very easily.Yes, yes. One of my reasons to become an actor was not to do a 9-5 job. Now if I start building a wall, then it will start feeling like a 9-5 job. You are always second-guessing the intention of the person sitting across you - which is just occupying too much of my mindspace when I have so many other things in my life to do, things that are not only about my image or my work. So I started protecting myself. I decided that now, I am going to expose my mind or my ideas to only people who I know are safe spaces. That is why I have (in) the last couple of years stopped talking to a lot of people. I kind of do not go out and be seen just because 'jo dikhta hai woh bikta hai'.I have stopped running the race of being the most seen, the most viewed - the search for the superlative adjective, mera ab khatam ho gaya hai. I have realised nothing is the 'most'. No matter where you reach, there will always be people above and below you. There is no point in running that stupid race. I want to enjoy the time I have here rather than always trying to run behind a milestone- and then reaching there and probably realising 'oh abhi toh kuch aur aa gaya hai'. It's never gonna end in this profession.Every way. I think I have much more control over my mind. It's not as easy to trigger me now as it was probably at 17. Age se hi fark padta hai woh.17 pe it will be very easy to trigger someone. Now, obviously, people can still continue to be like that. But that is the difference in me. Uss time toh I was like the majority, but now I feel it's not easy to trigger me because I kind of started to see things from a perspective. Does it even matter in the long run? Why am I investing my effort and time on this right now? And I realised there is nothing called coming first anymore. It's about whether you are really happy while doing what you are doing every day.Otherwise, I was just chasing, I was just competing in everything. Competing at getting maximum attendance to scoring maximum to winning the most number of accolades to all these competitive exams where you are given rankings. All these things, they have changed now. And I think a clarity of priorities has now come to me - it had in fact started coming to me as my 30s started.My 20s went in coming to terms with the fact that I have become an actor. I was wrapping my head around this profession. Meri life mein most things have happened late - compared to what I see girls doing now. Though I have no regret. I am so glad I completed my education properly. Then I started from scratch. I went south and learnt a new language. I am glad that I went through the drill because it kind of honed my patience and my tolerance.Most of my contemporaries - not contemporaries, they are actually relatively junior - they start in their teens. Either they have been made to go into this profession or they do not know any better, so everything happens very early.Main jab 30s mein pahunchi toh maine realise kiya ki - I did not even realise where my 20s went. Like when I started off in the Hindi film industry, I was probably in mid-20s already, which is late for a lot of girls to start. I keep thinking about it ki yaar maine apne career mein woh rom-com wali cheezein kari hi nahi hain.But I have no regrets. I really feel happy that I am this age. They also give me roles which they say are aged 28 - which is supposed to be a golden number, apparently.There are a lot of girls who are not okay with the script saying this character is 32 or 33. And they are like why can not it be 28? And I am like how does it make a difference kyunki screen pe koi bol nahi raha hai tumhari age. It is in your head ki you are 28 or 32.But I feel I have a better grip over my character if it's in the 30s because I kind of knew myself better when I was in 30s than in 20s. Because 20s mein hustling hi itni zyada chal rahi thi ki I was like a headless chicken - achha abhi south mein ho gaya, abhi Hindi mein aana hai, next kya karna hai, main ye nahi kar sakti, mujhe woh mil nahi raha hai. With so much going on, I did not have the frame of mind to sit down and realise ki hota kya hai ye 20s? It just went in hustling - I did not enjoy them.Even on screen, I never got to play someone in 20s.It's not like that has gone away. It's there even now. There are so many times that actresses are not chosen opposite certain stars saying that iski screen age zyada lagti hai. That's what happened to me in those early years. I took an opportunity to star opposite big stars, thinking it's a big film, only to fall into the trap and realise that younger stars now do not want to work with me.Now, of course, my trajectory is such that it does not really matter to me anymore. But even now, the big so-called young superstars who are 40+ do not want to star opposite girls who are 30+. They themselves might not be young, but they want younger girls opposite them.It does not affect me as much it affected me 10 years back. Now I just laugh at it - how frivolous and shallow it is.No. Regret is too heavy a word. But yeah, I miss having those rom-coms in my kitty where I could look like a college girl and dance around. Last I tried to do it in Judwaa 2 (2017), when I was 30. And people just could not digest it at that point. They were like, 'No, you have gone too far in a different direction. It's awkward to see you like that (laughs).' So, yeah, I lost out on that.Actresses try to do the fun, younger stuff first. I did not have that option, so I had to take the heavy lifting stuff first and then there was point of no return.Maybe Vidya ke saath bhi yehi hua hoga, maybe Tabu ke saath bhi yehi hua hoga.You know, not just writing, I am telling you from the other side, because I have a script - which is about this mid-30s woman who falls in love with a much younger boy. And you will not believe it, the problem is the people who are financing it. Ek major platform se toh we got a mandate like - how is this even right? Because a mid-30s woman - she was married and had a kid with someone else, and later on, shefalls in love with someone else. It was rejected on ethical grounds. That this is just so not right! And imagine an OTT platform telling you that right now. Theatre ki toh hum abhi baat hi nahi karenge.I remember there was a proper upmarket woman - like the mother of someone who's my age - who, after seeing Manmarziyaan said to me, 'But that was wrong, haan. What the character did with Abhishek Bachchan (his character). Itna achha aadmi tha. Shaadi karne ke baad why did your character go back to Vicky Kaushal's character?'Matlab, even women will not see a woman as a normal human being who can make mistakes. She should always be projected and presented like a devi. There are the two Ds - Devi or Daayan. It cannot be midway. I remember this during Thappad also - that you put her on such a pedestal that it is difficult for her to be treated like a normal human being. I had to take help of a writer like Kanika (Dhillon) who wrote Manmarziyaan, who wrote Haseen Dillruba, and ended up doing those grey characters. So much so that now if I do too much of a white character - people will not accept it (laughs)!Which I am very happy about. I have no qualms about it. Like I said, I have missed that bus of doing the righteous, miss-goody-two-shoes kind of roles, but I am glad that this lane that I have chosen does not have many who are like that.Even the ones who I feel have the potential to be in this lane - probably they have still not settled the fact in their head that this is a good enough lane and a competitive enough lane to be a part of. They still think that to be that big Bollywood heroine the only raasta is the mainstream, classic way.Which wasn't your route. When I entered the Hindi film industry, I realised that there are far more good-looking women who are able to do that stuff (mainstream) very well. I can not compete with that. I decided I might as well push myself in another direction rather than force-pushing myself in these big commercial films where either I will not get through at all, or even if I get through it, it will be the leftover stuff. Now that I have kind of become a producer and I am trying to put together stuff, I have realised how even women in the industry think when they approach a subject. In interviews, they talk a lot about how there are not enough scripts or there are not enough people making such films\\u2026No, they do not, and I have seen this first hand, and so now my whole perspective has changed. There are a lot of things that I have learnt after becoming a producer.Oh, yeah, and it is also a mistake to assume that all men are not feminists. I have come across so many of them who are more feminist than probably I was. Feminism is not gender specific.\"}"
