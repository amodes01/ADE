Top Rank has announced a pair of back-to-back shows on October 13th and 14th at Ariake Arena that feature seven title fights and the latest from rising star Tenshin Nasukawa.  The first evening sees Takuma Inoue (20-1, 5 KO), brother of Naoya, defend his bantamweight title against undefeated slugger Seiya Tsutsumi (11-0-2, 8 KO) in the main event. Inoue has proven more watchable than usual of late, scoring two of his five career knockouts in his last four fights, and Tsutsumi is a consistent entertainer.  Also on tap is Kenshiro Teraji (23-1, 14 KO) vs Cristofer Rosales (37-6, 22 KO) for the vacant WBC flyweight title, WBA flyweight champion Seigo Yuri Akui's (20-2-1, 11 KO) second defense of his title against Thailand's Thananchai Charunphak (25-1, 15 KO), and Shokichi Iwata's (13-1, 10 KO) clash with Jairo Noriega (14-0, 3 KO) for the vacant WBO light flyweight belt.  The following evening, Junto Nakatani (28-0, 21 KO) meets Petch Sor Chitpattana (76-1, 53 KO) for his second fight in under three months. Petch has spent virtually his entire career in his native Thailand, leaving only to drop a unanimous decision to Takuma Inoue in 2018.  The supporting cast features Kosei Tanaka (20-1, 13 KO) making the first defense of his second WBO super flyweight title reign against South African contender Phumelele Cafu (10-0-3, 8 KO), Anthony Olascuaga (7-1, 5 KO) defending his newly acquired WBO flyweight belt against former light flyweight titlist Jonathan \\\"Bomba\\\" Gonzalez (28-3-1, 14 KO), and the aforementioned Nasukawa (4-0, 2 KO) facing Gerwin Asilo (9-0, 4 KO).  I'd have preferred to see Inoue and Nakatani just duke it out, but I will take it. Solid doubleheader.\"}"
