Peter Leary is the Canon Murray Fellow in Irish History at Oxford University, and will soon release his book 'Unapproved routes: Histories of the Irish border, 1922-72', which explores issues of state and identify while looking at the impact the border had on everyday life in the region.

Even after partition, nobody sat down and thought 'let us create a customs barrier' but once the border was in place it became an unintended consequence of diverging tax regimes.  \\\\\\\"Clearly a Brexit would bring back or 'harden' the border on some level, probably in small ways at first. But we could be talking less about what we might see immediately, than about how relationships between Britain and Ireland, Britain and Europe, and North and South might then evolve over ten, or twenty, or thirty years or more.\\\\\\\"  Mr Leary added the people of Fermanagh have always found a way of coping, though, showing \\\\\\\"great creativity in finding ways to make do and even sometimes turn it to their own advantage.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Smuggling was, of course, the best known example of this,\\\\\\\" he said. \\\\\\\"But that was always about making the best of often very difficult circumstances.\\\\\\\"  Advertisement  Related posts: No related posts.", "output": "{\"topical_attitudes\": [{\"source\": {\"entity\": \"Peter Leary\", \"references\": [\"Peter Leary\"]}, \"target\": {\"topic\": \"Brexit\", \"references\": [\"Brexit\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"Clearly a Brexit would bring back or 'harden' the border on some level, probably in small ways at first.\"], \"attitude\": \"Negative\"}, {\"source\": {\"entity\": \"Peter Leary\", \"references\": [\"Peter Leary\"]}, \"target\": {\"topic\": \"Irish border\", \"references\": [\"border\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"The border was not something that many, if anyone, on either side wanted or expected.\", \"Once the border was in place it became an unintended consequence of diverging tax regimes.\"], \"attitude\": \"Negative\"}, {\"source\": {\"entity\": \"Peter Leary\", \"references\": [\"Peter Leary\"]}, \"target\": {\"topic\": \"historical impact of the Irish border\", \"references\": [\"impact the border had on everyday life in the region\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"which explores issues of state and identity while looking at the impact the border had on everyday life in the region.\"], \"attitude\": \"Neutral\"}, {\"source\": {\"entity\": \"Peter Leary\", \"references\": [\"Peter Leary\"]}, \"target\": {\"topic\": \"emotional experience of the border\", \"references\": [\"emotional experience of dislocation\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"there was also an emotional experience of dislocation, a sense of being set apart from familiar places and people.\"], \"attitude\": \"Negative\"}, {\"source\": {\"entity\": \"Peter Leary\", \"references\": [\"Peter Leary\"]}, \"target\": {\"topic\": \"smuggling\", \"references\": [\"Smuggling\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"Smuggling was, of course, the best known example of this.\"], \"attitude\": \"Neutral\"}, {\"source\": {\"entity\": \"Peter Leary\", \"references\": [\"Peter Leary\"]}, \"target\": {\"topic\": \"creativity of the people of Fermanagh\", \"references\": [\"great creativity in finding ways to make do\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"the people of Fermanagh have always found a way of coping, though, showing great creativity in finding ways to make do.\"], \"attitude\": \"Positive\"}], \"entity_attitudes\": [{\"entity1\": {\"entity\": \"Peter Leary\", \"references\": [\"Peter Leary\"]}, \"entity2\": {\"entity\": \"Phillip Callahan\", \"references\": [\"Phillip Callahan\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"One wartime observer, Phillip Callahan, who served in the US Army Air Forces near Belleek, described it as 'one of the worst examples of frontier bureaucracy in existence.'\"], \"attitude\": \"Neutral\"}]}"}

Those in favor of \\\\\\\"Brexit\\\\\\\"-Britain's exit from the EU-emphasized the need for the United Kingdom to take back control of its economy and borders, while those who want to remain in the Union warned British citizens that exiting would be a \\\\\\\"one-way leap into the dark,\\\\\\\" with potentially devastating economic implications.  Boris Johnson, London's former mayor, a member of the Conservative Party, and a leading proponent of the campaign to leave the EU, clashed with his successor Sadiq Khan, a member of the Labour Party, over the economy, immigration, and Britain's role on the international stage.  Britain's possible exit from the EU has garnered warnings from world leaders, including President Obama. British Prime Minister David Cameron has also vocally opposed Brexit, telling voters in a last-ditch appeal Tuesday to consider the ramifications for future generations of an exit from the EU.  Members of the \\\\\\\"Remain\\\\\\\" campaign made similar arguments during the nearly two-hour live television debate on Tuesday evening, the last of its kind before British citizens will vote in the referendum on Thursday. Khan, along with Ruth Davidson, leader of the Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party, and Frances O'Grady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, characterized exiting the EU as a gamble that could have grave economic and rights implications. He accused the Leave campaign of not having a plan in place to guide Britain in a post-Brexit world.  \\\\\\\"You want the British public to take a one-way leap into the dark without a plan,\\\\\\\" said Khan during the debate, which featured questions from a roughly 6,000-person strong audience split evenly between supporters of each campaign.  \\\\\\\"I know the EU is not perfect, but the benefits far outweigh any costs,\\\\\\\" Davidson explained during closing remarks. \\\\\\\"The Britain that I know works with its neighbors. It does not walk away from them.\\\\\\\" Davidson said British citizens would not be able to reverse a decision to leave the EU.  These claims were rejected by Brexit proponents. Johnson, Labour member of Parliament Gisela Stuart, and Conservative energy minister Andrea Leadsom all expressed confidence that a Britain untethered from the EU could write its own trade agreements, control its borders, and shed EU laws and regulations.  \\\\\\\"We do not need unelected, bureaucratic European leaders \\\\u2026 to tell us what our rights should be,\\\\\\\" said Leadsom. \\\\\\\"We should take back control and look after our own society.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"They say we can not do it; we say we can. They say we have no choice but to bow down to Brussels; we say that they are woefully underestimating this country and what we can do,\\\\\\\" Johnson said. \\\\\\\"I believe that this Thursday can be our country's Independence Day.\\\\\\\"  Both sides accused the other of resorting to scare tactics in order to sell their positions to the public.  The British public is split on whether the United Kingdom should remain in the EU, according to polling tracked by the Economist since the campaigns for and against Brexit officially launched in mid-April. As of Monday, 44 percent of voters wanted to remain in the EU, while 43 percent favored Brexit.

Published 12:00 am Wednesday, June 22, 2016  \\\\\\\"I wish to speak to you today about the tragedy of Europe,\\\\\\\" Winston Churchill told his audience in 1946. But he wasn't speaking of a united Europe as a bad thing. Actually, he strongly supported the development of a European Union, and probably would not embrace \\\\\\\"Brexit,\\\\\\\" the decision of the United Kingdom to leave the EU, which will soon be in the hands of voters.  \\\\\\\"Let Europe Arise!\\\\\\\" former Prime Minister Churchill stated at a speech to the University of Zurich, which you can find in \\\\\\\"Vital Speeches of the Day\\\\\\\" published on Oct. 1, 1946 (you can also find it in the book The Sinews of Peace, under \\\\\\\"Post-War Speeches by Winston S. Churchill, published by Cassell & Company, Ltd. in 1948).  \\\\\\\"If Europe is to be saved from infinite misery and, indeed, from final doom, there must be this act of faith in the European family and this act of oblivion against all the crimes and follies of the past, and the free peoples of Europe must rise to the height of these resolves of the soul and of the instinct of the spirit of man,\\\\\\\" Churchill said.  And he wasn't some \\\\\\\"Britain First\\\\\\\" character like the assassin of British MP Jo Cox, where everything is about national sovereignty.  \\\\\\\"The structure of the United States of Europe, if well and truly built, will be such as to make the material strength of a single state less important,\\\\\\\" Churchill stated. \\\\\\\"Small nations will count as much as large ones and gain their honor by their contribution to the common cause.\\\\\\\"  Of course he did not like some of the specific plans of his day, namely the Treaty of Paris as well as the European Defense Community. But when he got back into office after his party lost parliament in 1945, he pushed hard for the West European Union.  \\\\\\\"If we are to form a United States of Europe, or whatever name it may take, we must begin now. \\\\u2026 Our constant aim must be to build and fortify the strength of the United Nations organization. Under and within that world concept, we must recreate the European family in a regional structure, called, it may be, the United States of Europe, and the first practical step would be to form a Council of Europe. If at first all states of Europe are not willing or able to join the union, we must nevertheless proceed to assemble and combine those who will and can.\\\\\\\"  I am sure there are some who would say that things are different now than in Churchill's time, with Middle East refugees. But the great British Prime Minister knew that xenophobia and hatred of others was what led to the need for a stronger Europe to combat these in the first place.  \\\\\\\"It is from Europe that has sprung that series of frightful and nationalistic morals originated by the Teutonic nations in their rise to power, which we have seen in the 20th century and which have for a long time wrecked the peace and marred the prospects of all mankind,\\\\\\\" Churchill told the people.  He also credited \\\\\\\"that great republic across the Atlantic Ocean has at length realized that the ruin or enslavement of Europe has involved their own fate as well.\\\\\\\"  That's right - Churchill wanted the United States to play a strong role in helping foster a unified Europe. We need to study what Churchill said, beyond the Iron Curtain speech and catty comments to Lady Astor.  If we are so angry over a bust of him being allegedly removed from the White House - fact check it - we should listen to his words about what should be done in Europe.", "output": "{\"topical_attitudes\": [{\"source\": {\"entity\": \"Winston Churchill\", \"references\": [\"Winston Churchill\"]}, \"target\": {\"topic\": \"Brexit\", \"references\": [\"Brexit\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"he probably would not embrace 'Brexit', the decision of the United Kingdom to leave the EU\"], \"attitude\": \"Negative\"}, {\"source\": {\"entity\": \"Winston Churchill\", \"references\": [\"Winston Churchill\"]}, \"target\": {\"topic\": \"European Union\", \"references\": [\"development of a European Union\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"Actually, he strongly supported the development of a European Union\"], \"attitude\": \"Positive\"}, {\"source\": {\"entity\": \"Winston Churchill\", \"references\": [\"Winston Churchill\"]}, \"target\": {\"topic\": \"United States of Europe\", \"references\": [\"United States of Europe\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"The structure of the United States of Europe, if well and truly built, will be such as to make the material strength of a single state less important\", \"We must recreate the European family in a regional structure, called, it may be, the United States of Europe\"], \"attitude\": \"Positive\"}, {\"source\": {\"entity\": \"Winston Churchill\", \"references\": [\"Winston Churchill\"]}, \"target\": {\"topic\": \"xenophobia and hatred of others\", \"references\": [\"xenophobia and hatred of others\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"the great British Prime Minister knew that xenophobia and hatred of others was what led to the need for a stronger Europe to combat these\"], \"attitude\": \"Negative\"}], \"entity_attitudes\": [{\"entity1\": {\"entity\": \"Winston Churchill\", \"references\": [\"Winston Churchill\"]}, \"entity2\": {\"entity\": \"United Kingdom\", \"references\": [\"United Kingdom\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"he probably would not embrace 'Brexit', the decision of the United Kingdom to leave the EU\"], \"attitude\": \"Negative\"}, {\"entity1\": {\"entity\": \"Winston Churchill\", \"references\": [\"Winston Churchill\"]}, \"entity2\": {\"entity\": \"United States\", \"references\": [\"United States\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"Churchill wanted the United States to play a strong role in helping foster a unified Europe\"], \"attitude\": \"Positive\"}, {\"entity1\": {\"entity\": \"Winston Churchill\", \"references\": [\"Winston Churchill\"]}, \"entity2\": {\"entity\": \"Jo Cox\", \"references\": [\"assassin of British MP Jo Cox\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"he wasn't some 'Britain First' character like the assassin of British MP Jo Cox\"], \"attitude\": \"Negative\"}]}"}

Aside from the peace and prosperity?  What ho, Wonkists and Wonkastrians on both sides of the Atlantic! Are we steeling ourselves for potentially the second-greatest electoral mistake of 2016 tomorrow?  We are talking, of course, about the Brexit referendum Thursday, in which UK subjects will decide whether to listen to some Oxbridge Tories and free themselves from the bureaucratic shackles of the European Union, in favor of proper English shackles provided by these same Tories (plus a lot less money).  Polls are basically dead even on whether Great Britain will vote for a British Exit, or Brexit, from the 28-nation EU. Like the rise of the Donald Trump in America, this is a sign that nativist resentment is always a match for pointy-headed intellectual notions about so-called \\\\\\\"arithmetic\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\"history.\\\\\\\" Most economists reckon Britain would be the poorer for leaving the EU, and the precedent would be a setback for the world economy (to say nothing of a continuation of 70 years of basically unprecedented peace between European nations), and could lead to a breakup of the UK itself when Scotland...  Wait, wait, wait, HEY! Where are you going? Look, we know that you, dear reader, have important naked Sara Benincasa movies to watch, so we will let you do your own research on the ins and outs of British trade and immigration policy. We will just point out who is for and against Brexit, so that you can know whether your reaction to the referendum results should be \\\\\\\"Top hole!\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\"Hard luck!\\\\\\\"  Against leaving we have not only god-Emperor B.H. Obama and your nerd boyfriend Paul Krugman , but also John Oliver, America's favorite teacup Englishman.

[wonkbar]<a href=\\\\\\\"https: //wonkette.substack.com/p/british-member-of-parliament-jo-cox-murdered-american-gun-nuts-have-a-good-larf\\\\\\\"></a>[/wonkbar]Leading the Brexit push ( aside from deranged murderers ) are some members of the ruling Conservative Party, or Tories. Tory Prime Minister David Cameron came up with the brilliant plan of holding a vote, although he's against leaving the EU (he just wants a bunch of special rules for the UK). Alongside the pro-Brexit Tories you have the U.K. Independence Party (UKIP), a group that thinks the problem with thinly veiled racism is the unnecessary veil.  One of their main reasons for leaving the EU would be reducing immigration into the UK, eliminating the freedom of travel and work across borders that is one of the EU's main selling points. The other is a mostly crap, but popular belief that Britain sends too much money to \\\\\\\"those people,\\\\\\\" basically the reasoning behind all those dumb new cities in Atlanta that white people create so they can avoid paying for roads in black neighborhoods.  But most importantly, one of the main proponents of Brexit is this fucking prick , former London mayor Boris Johnson.    He's much smarter than Trump, so what's his excuse?

Market volatility in the immediate aftermath of such an unprecedented decision would likely drive down the British pound and push the U.S. dollar up, keeping Federal Reserve interest rate rises on hold for even longer as the damage is assessed and divorce terms are negotiated with the EU.  Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen on Tuesday repeated the U.S. central bank's concerns over the \\\\\\\"Brexit\\\\\\\" vote, telling lawmakers it could have \\\\\\\"significant economic repercussions\\\\\\\", including a flight to the safety of dollar assets that would push up the dollar and further slow U.S. exports.  Britain, the world's fifth largest economy, is the seventh largest U.S. trading partner, with $56 billion in U.S. goods exports to Britain and $58 billion in imports from the UK in 2015.  Advertisement  Aircraft and aircraft engines are the biggest U.S. exports to Britain, while cars and trucks are the largest U.S. imports from the UK, with two-way pharmaceuticals trade important for both countries.  More than half of Britain's exports go to Europe though, where a vote to leave the EU could put it at a disadvantage.  Leaving the EU would cost Britain its privileged free trading status with the continent, throwing up problems for multinational companies with British operations, including higher tariffs on UK-produced cars and engines as well as uncertainty over how banks and insurers in the London financial hub can operate in Europe.  The United Kingdom also would be excluded from EU free trade agreements with other countries, such as those with Canada, Mexico and South Korea. The EU currently has Preferential Trade Agreements with 52 countries and is negotiating agreements with another 72.  Advertisement  A massive trans-Atlantic trade deal under negotiation with the United States would also be in jeopardy. President Barack Obama has warned it could be years before Washington is ready to start talks on a bilateral deal with Britain.  \\\\\\\"We think a strong UK in a strong and unified European Union is in everybody's interest,\\\\\\\" U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman said on Tuesday. \\\\\\\"We think their voice is stronger as part of a larger entity.\\\\\\\"  It could take Britain up to two years to negotiate new trading and regulatory arrangements with Europe, creating a pall of uncertainty that will dampen trade and capital flows and put business decisions on hold, said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors in New York.  \\\\\\\"The likely outcome is more of a pause, an additional slowdown. What are economies struggling with? Global demand is low, trade is low. Growth is slow. None of this will help that,\\\\\\\" he added.

{"instruction": "Extract attitudes between entities and topics from the article in JSON format and categorize them [Positive, Neutral, Negative] and justify them quoting the article", "input": "Investors and markets around the world are on edge as Britain decides whether it will stay in the European Union. The uncertainty around the future of Europe as we know it sent markets tumbling last week, and the CBOE volatility index, a measure of investor fear, spiked.  Investors have significant positions in foreign funds these days. Over the last decade, investors poured $643 billion into world stock funds, while they pulled $834 billion out of U.S. stock funds, according to the Investment Company Institute's 2016 Fact Book. So they are naturally concerned about how the so-called Brexit could affect their portfolios.  Some investors have recently sold their foreign funds. \\\\\\\"Investors pulled $1.1 billion from U.K. equity funds in the week to yesterday, according to data from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. This was the fastest rate of withdrawals in 13 months,\\\\\\\" according to data from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. This was the fastest rate of withdrawals in 13 months,\\\\\\\" according to The Street.  But we know that the best returns come from staying invested long term. Those who sell out of the market today will have to decide when to get invested again, and history shows that by the time investors feel ready to get back in the market, they have often missed out on significant gains.  Do not let uncertainty hold you back  Often investors wait to see how things progress, but this assumes that eventually they will feel more certain about where the market's headed. The reality is that uncertainty is part of investing, just like it's part of life, and as investors, we have to come to terms with uncertainty if we hope to get ahead.  Even after Thursday's vote, there will still be uncertainty. If Britain votes to leave the E.U., there will be two years of negotiations on the terms of the separation. And even then, we will not know how Britain and the E.U. will do on their own. So if you need to be invested to reach your goals, then get invested. Do not let the uncertainty of a Brexit hold you back from doing the work you need to do to get ahead.  Invest in what you know now -- and adapt as markets change  Focus on what you know now. You know why you are invested and what you are trying to accomplish. For most of us, investing is not just about money, it's about having the freedom to live the life we want-to retire on our schedule, to give our kids the option to go to the college of their choice. These goals are not tied to the result of the British referendum.  You also know that over the long term-even through times of global crisis and political upheaval-investing in stocks has been the best way to make money. The volatility of stocks makes it tough to hold stocks long enough to benefit from their terrific long-term results, but if you stick it out, those gains can change your life.  Another thing you probably know is how different areas of the market have been performing lately and, long before the Brexit, Europe wasn't performing well. Most Europe funds and ETFs have been out of favor for some time now; the iShares MSCI Eurozone ETF (EZU) has lagged the S&P 500 for the last three years running, and my firm's Upgrading strategy has kept us out of these funds.  U.S. funds are currently in favor  Decades of academic research and a January 2016 Morningstar study have found that funds that have done well recently tend to continue to do well for the next few months or even years . At the moment, that means U.S. stock funds. And funds that have not performed well tend to remain out of favor for some time.

His recent column on \\\\\\\"Is America Really in Decline? What We Can Learn from Britain\\\\\\\" raises a few points which shed some light on the declinist argument and on the case for Britain's exit from the European Union, or Brexit.  As Pethokoukis puts it, drawing on historian Robert Tombs, the so-called decline panic that Britain experienced in the post-1945 decades \\\\\\\"rests on two assumptions: First, Britain experienced a collapse in global influence and economic dynamism. Second, those results stemmed from 'long-standing failures' of the nation's core institutions.\\\\\\\"  Pethokoukis implies this was false. But a good bit of it is actually true. British influence in the world did decline precipitously after 1945, as British withdrawals from the eastern Mediterranean (1947) and East of Suez (1967-68) illustrate. Some of this decline resulted from the rise of the superpowers after 1945, who outmatched the U.K. There was nothing the U.K. could have done about this.  Loss of influence  Another and much more complicated problem was Britain's post-war economic weakness, which led directly to most of these withdrawals. In any case, this wasn't a panic: it felt like a loss of influence for the simple reason that it was a loss of influence.  Then there is Britain's post-war economic dynamism. Again, it is - to me - inarguable that Britain performed worse after 1945 than most of Western Europe. The question is why. It may, as Tombs implies, have been mere post-war catch-up. But it was likely more than that. Britain does seem to have suffered from union-induced overmanning and amateurism in sectors of British corporate management (car manufacturers spring to mind). Worse, after 1945, the U.K. went down the road of nationalization, currency controls and demand management, all of which tended to prioritize stability and vested interests over creative destruction and dynamism.  Pethokoukis is completely right, on the other hand, that this led to an assault on \\\\\\\"the nation's core institutions,\\\\\\\" which were taken to be stolid, stuck in the mud, and undynamic. The results can be seen if you look around any British town - all of which underwent an attack of architectural vandalism of the most Brutalist kind, in the belief that the large scale use of reinforced concerted was, ipso facto, modernizing and would somehow jolt the British psyche from its torpor.  More broadly, if there was a guiding theme in Britain between the early 1960s and the late 1990s, it was \\\\\\\"modernization.\\\\\\\" Of course, that term meant different things to different people - but by and large it meant more top-down control, relentless legislative fiddling, and, except during the Thatcher/Major era, an expanded state.  The U.S. is not the UK, but the comparison has its merits  This is not as far from the U.S. experience as Pethokoukis implies. We are not, fortunately, dwarfed by superpower competitors. On the other hand, there is near-peer China, a range of regional competitors, and we really have not won a war for 25 years. We are not at risk, right now, of a U.K.-style collapse, but we are on the back heel in Europe and the South China Sea, we are clearly doing far worse than that in the Middle East, and U.S. defense spending trends look a bit too much like those of the U.K. for comfort.  And, on the economic front, while we do look good compared to Europe, that's cold comfort - especially when President Obama's", "output": "{\"topical_attitudes\": [{\"source\": {\"entity\": \"James Pethokoukis\", \"references\": [\"James Pethokoukis\"]}, \"target\": {\"topic\": \"declinist argument\", \"references\": [\"declinist argument\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"His recent column on 'Is America Really in Decline?' raises a few points which shed some light on the declinist argument.\"], \"attitude\": \"Neutral\"}, {\"source\": {\"entity\": \"James Pethokoukis\", \"references\": [\"James Pethokoukis\"]}, \"target\": {\"topic\": \"Brexit\", \"references\": [\"Brexit\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"The case for Britain's exit from the European Union, or Brexit.\"], \"attitude\": \"Neutral\"}, {\"source\": {\"entity\": \"James Pethokoukis\", \"references\": [\"James Pethokoukis\"]}, \"target\": {\"topic\": \"Britain's post-war economic weakness\", \"references\": [\"Britain's post-war economic weakness\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"This wasn't a panic: it felt like a loss of influence for the simple reason that it was a loss of influence.\"], \"attitude\": \"Neutral\"}, {\"source\": {\"entity\": \"James Pethokoukis\", \"references\": [\"James Pethokoukis\"]}, \"target\": {\"topic\": \"Britain's post-war economic dynamism\", \"references\": [\"Britain's post-war economic dynamism\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"It is -

By Jo Gilbert  When asked if there could be any merit from a leave result following tomorrow's referendum, the resounding voice from the trade is 'no'.  When asked if there could be any positive outcomes from a leave result following tomorrow's referendum, the resounding voice from the UK trade is 'no'.  But looking at the way the polls are at the moment, the trade might have to prepare itself for an unpopular result.  John McLaren, UK director of the Wine Institute of California, is asking the UK trade to look beyond the uncertainty-is-bad-for-business mantra and see the \\\\\\\"bigger picture\\\\\\\".  He said: \\\\\\\"There is a psychological barrier within EU to play the safe option, which means staying within the EU community. This can be limiting. I am more excited about the potential of developing relationships outside of Europe in terms of Canada and US.\\\\\\\"  While many are concerned about the immediate effects of a UK exit, including the damage to the exchange rate and the power of the pound, in his chat to Harpers, McLaren asked the trade to keep an open mind to the possibility of long-term benefits.  \\\\\\\"I think the danger is that most people with think about how it will affect next week's mortgage payments rather than what we could be achieving in five years time,\\\\\\\" he said.  \\\\\\\"I think leaving is the more interesting proposition. There is more potential in it for rapid change and advancement rather than the safe option which is next week to be back where we were before.\\\\\\\"  Tim North at Les Grands Chais de France, traders of wines and alcohols in France with strong UK connections, disagrees.  He says that the devil is in the - in this case, the unseen - detail.  \\\\\\\"There are so many unseen barriers to trade that people do not know about. At the moment the legalities on drinks labels are the same for the UK as the rest of Europe. If we leave and the legislation changes, then producers exporting to England would have to come up with two separate labels. I know many small French producers who would be very affected by the additional costs. This goes for the wider world too - including California,\\\\\\\" he said.  North also challenged the idea that leaving the EU would lead to Britain becoming more entrenched in a global market.  \\\\\\\"It's ridiculous to think you can turn the clock back to the way it was before. The world is changing. In terms of technology and communication, the world is becoming smaller. We need to be part of a bigger group if we want to thrive in the modern world.\\\\\\\"  McClaren went on to point out that from an external point of view, having a national identity separate from Europe would drive innovation in how products are tailored to the UK market.  He said: \\\\\\\"A lot of Americans like to think of Europe as a market, so they think the British must be same as the Germans. Only when they delve deeper do they realise there is big different between a French or German and British consumer.\\\\\\\"  He also argues that the deep rooted relationships between England and Europe's top producing wine countries, will ensure longevity.  \\\\\\\"If we leave, people will still buy the cars they want to buy and they will continue drink wine from France and Italy and Spain purely out of convenience, because they are so close, and because we have been doing it for decades.

It comes after the Ukip leader was accused of adopting Nazi style propaganda tactics to help win the EU referendum. The poster Mr Farage unveiled showed refugees on the Slovenian border - part of Europe's passport-free Schengen area.  Next to the billboard was the headline \\\\\\\"Breaking Point\\\\\\\" and underneath it \\\\\\\"the EU has failed us all\\\\\\\".  When asked if he had apologised for the controversial billboard - as one Ukip MEP claimed during the television BBC debate on Tuesday - Mr Farage responded after his speech: \\\\\\\"I apologised for the timing\\\\u2026 but I can not apologise for the truth.\\\\\\\"  The SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon described the poster as \\\\\\\"disgusting\\\\\\\" while one of her MPs, Pete Wishard, also weighed in saying that a \\\\\\\"vote for leave is pretty much become a vote for petty xenophobia and anti-immigrant rhetoric\\\\\\\". American playwright Bonnie Greer, who has famously clashed with Mr Farage in the past, compared him to Nazi military leader Herman Goering.  George Osborne, the Chancellor, described it \\\\\\\"disgusting and vile\\\\\\\" and said it had \\\\\\\"echoes of literature used in the 1930s\\\\\\\".  Mr Farage also used his last major speech before voters head to the polls to cast their vote in the EU referendum to urge British people to vote with the \\\\\\\"heart\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"soul\\\\\\\". He added that voters could make Friday the UK's \\\\\\\"Independence Day\\\\\\\".  \\\\\\\"Let us stop pretending what this European project is,\\\\\\\" the Ukip leader said in his speech. \\\\\\\"They have an anthem, they are building an army, they have already got their own police force and of course they have got a flag.  \\\\\\\"At the end of the day tomorrow when people vote they must make a decision: which flag is theirs? I want, I want us to live under British passports and under the British flag.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Vote with your heart, vote with your soul, vote with pride in this country and its people and together we can make tomorrow our Independence Day - a big day in our national history.  Speaking to press from all over the world and Vote Leave supporters in Westminster, Mr Farage branded the EU \\\\\\\"a big business cartel\\\\\\\".  He said: \\\\\\\"We find ourselves, for the benefit of tariff-free trade, having to accept unlimited free movement of people. We find ourselves prohibited from making our own deals with the rest of the world.\\\\\\\"  Mr Farage accused Brussels of usurping control and sovereignty from the UK, and imposing EU law which \\\\\\\"is supreme\\\\\\\". His voice rising with passion and pulling out his passport from his jacket and waving it in front of the microphone - a signature move by the Ukip leader - he declared: \\\\\\\"We do not even have a British passport anymore\\\\\\\" - raising a clap from his supporters in the audience.  He said: \\\\\\\"Let us stop pretending what this European project is - they have an anthem, they are building an army, they have already got their own police force, and of course they have got a", "output": "{\"topical_attitudes\": [{\"source\": {\"topic\": \"EU referendum\", \"references\": [\"EU referendum\"]}, \"target\": {\"topic\": \"Brexit\", \"references\": [\"Brexit\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"Sign up to our free Brexit and beyond email for the latest headlines on what Brexit is meaning for the UK\"], \"attitude\": \"Neutral\"}, {\"source\": {\"topic\": \"EU referendum\", \"references\": [\"EU referendum\"]}, \"target\": {\"topic\": \"EU\", \"references\": [\"EU\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"Mr Farage accused Brussels of usurping control and sovereignty from the UK, and imposing EU law which \\\"is supreme\\\"\"], \"attitude\": \"Negative\"}, {\"source\": {\"topic\": \"Brexit\", \"references\": [\"Brexit\"]}, \"target\": {\"topic\": \"UK independence\", \"references\": [\"UK's \\\"Independence Day\\\"\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"Vote with your heart, vote with your soul, vote with pride in this country and its people and together we can make tomorrow our Independence Day\"], \"attitude\": \"Positive\"}], \"entity_attitudes\": [{\"entity1\": {\"entity\": \"Nigel Farage\", \"references\": [\"Nigel Farage\"]}, \"entity2\": {\"entity\": \"Nicola Sturgeon\", \"references\": [\"Nicola Sturgeon\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"The SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon described the poster as \\\"disgusting\\\"\"], \"attitude\": \"Negative\"}, {\"entity1\": {\"entity\": \"Nigel Farage\", \"references\": [\"Nigel Farage\"]}, \"entity2\": {\"entity\": \"Bonnie Greer\", \"references\": [\"Bonnie Greer\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"American playwright Bonnie Greer, who has famously clashed with Mr Farage in the past, compared him to Nazi military leader Herman Goering\"], \"attitude\": \"Negative\"}, {\"entity1\": {\"entity\": \"Nigel Farage\", \"references\": [\"Nigel Farage\"]}, \"entity2\": {\"entity\": \"George Osborne\", \"references\": [\"George Osborne\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"George Osborne, the Chancellor, described it \\\"disgusting and vile\\\" and said it had \\\"echoes of literature used in the 1930s\\\"\"], \"attitude\": \"Negative\"}, {\"entity1\": {\"entity\": \"Nigel Farage\", \"references\": [\"Nigel Farage\"]}, \"entity2\": {\"entity\": \"UKIP\", \"references\": [\"Ukip\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"The poster Mr Farage unveiled showed refugees on the Slovenian border - part of Europe's passport-free Schengen area\"], \"attitude\": \"Neutral\"}]}"}

Read our privacy policy  Winston Churchill's delightful quote, \\\\\\\"the best argument against democracy is a five minute conversation with the average voter\\\\\\\" could never be more apposite when it comes to the EU referendum. Moreover, the average voter could be forgiven for replying, \\\\\\\"The best argument against democracy is a five-minute conversation with the average politician.\\\\\\\" What should have been an intelligent debate on the pros and cons of remaining in Europe has been dumbed down to a shouting match and desperate confirmation bias - the search and use of data to prove the point one believes in, coupled with an infinite capacity to ignore or refuse to listen to any counter arguments.  John Major came closest to presenting an honest case when he said that he was \\\\\\\"no starry eyed Europe enthusiast but had no doubt that the UK should remain in the EU\\\\\\\". The decision whether or not to remain hinges on making a large number of often complex trade-offs, ideally based on facts. I too have ended up firmly in favour of remaining.  Put simply, the Leave campaign has failed completely to convince me that the balance of advantage lies in quitting. No positive case has been made and no substantive counter arguments to the risks and uncertainties of leaving have been provided. Dismissing alternative points of view from credible independent experts as Cameron-sponsored collusion is schoolboy stuff and insulting to the average voter.  The Leave campaign now seems to be focusing on two issues: firstly, immigration - \\\\\\\"We need to control our borders\\\\\\\" - and secondly, sovereignty - \\\\\\\"We need to control our own laws\\\\\\\". They have lost the economic argument (more on that later). Moreover, their logic on immigration and sovereignty is fatally flawed and misleading.  Contrary to voter expectations, at no time has the Leave campaign argued that Brexit will result in lower immigration from the EU. Their rhetoric suggests they favour the prospect of an Australian-style points system to decide whom we would allow to enter the country. This is a seductive proposition but dangerously misleading when viewed in isolation or out of context. First, the statistical truth: 27.3 per cent of Australia's population is foreign born compared to 12.3 per cent in the UK. So what Leave is really saying is that the number of EU immigrants coming to the UK might not change with Brexit but that labour markets are inefficient and that Government is better placed to decide what skills we need and do not need. Putting aside my cynicism that Government knows better than employers with free access to EU labour skills, the facts do not support this case.  Employers thus far have done an excellent job at taking advantage of access to EU skills - and the UK as a country has benefited. 78 per cent of EU immigrants are in work in the UK compared to 73 per cent of the rest of the population. Moreover, the value of these immigrants to the UK economy is well documented by detailed research by Christian Dustmann, University College London (born in Herford, Germany) and Tomas Frattini, University of Milan (born in Bergamo, Italy), neither of whom can be dismissed as \\\\\\\"Remain stooges\\\\\\\".

Between 2001 and 2011, the net fiscal contribution of recent arrivals from the eastern European countries that have joined the EU since 2004 has amounted to almost \\\\u00a35bn. Even during the worst years of the financial crisis, in 2007-11, they made a net contribution of almost \\\\u00a32bn to British public finances. Migrants from other European countries chipped in \\\\u00a38.6bn.  In short, most EU migrants come here to work and add value to the UK economy. So what about the 22 per cent not working? Well, the UK government has already reached an agreement with the EU on out-of-work benefits. Newly arrived EU migrants are banned from claiming jobseekers' allowance for three months. If they have not found a job within six months they will be required to leave. EU migrant workers in the UK who lose their job, through no fault of their own, are entitled to the same benefits as UK citizens, including jobseekers' allowance and housing benefit, for six months. And by way of reminder, David Cameron secured concessions from the EU in his negotiations whereby access of newly arriving EU workers to non-contributory in-work benefits is limited for a total period of up to four years from the commencement of employment. David Cameron may have failed in his original demand to ban migrant workers from sending child benefit money back home but he successfully gained agreement that payments will instead be linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live. The new rules will apply immediately for new arrivals, and for existing claimants from 2020.  Leave campaigners also point to the impact of immigrants on wages and employment. First, let us dispel the argument often made that EU workers are low-skilled. EU employees in the UK are on average more highly educated than their UK peers. Only 15 per cent of EU employees left formal education before the age of 17 against 44 per cent of UK-born employees. More than 40 per cent of EU workers were educated beyond the age of 21 compared with less than a quarter of UK-born workers.  Law school professor's takedown of the Brexit argument goes viral  Moreover, there is little evidence that more migrants push wages down or unemployment up. Economists from the Centre for Economic Performance in School of Economics (also not Government lackeys) say that when they look at the areas with the largest increase in EU immigration, these have not seen the sharpest falls in employment or wages since 2008. Research published last year by the Office for Budget Responsibility suggested there was a small negative effect of migration on the wages of locals in the semi-skilled and unskilled service sector, such as care workers, shop assistants, restaurant and bar workers but the impact of migration on the wages of the UK-born in this sector since 2004 has been no more than 1 per cent over a period of eight years.  Finally, immigration is not a single issue debate. Significant economic issues are linked. If the UK wants future access to the EU Single Market, we will not be able to \\\\\\\"control our borders\\\\\\\". Free movement of people lies at the core of EU values alongside free access to EU markets. The Leave campaign has shifted its viewpoint from wanting to negotiate access to the Single Market to seeking alternative models in order to keep the focus on immigration, not economics.  Norway and Switzerland are quoted as potential role models - but they are not. Both Norway and Switzerland have accepted the free movement of EU citizens as part of their trade agreements with the EU.

The top four country sources of immigrants into Switzerland are Germany, Italy, Portugal and France; the top four for Norway are Poland, Sweden, Lithuania and Germany; the top four for the UK are India, Poland, Pakistan and Ireland.  Michael Gove has pointed to the Albania-Ukraine model as the way forward. Putting aside that Albania accounts for 0.1 per cent of European trade and half the population live below the global poverty line of $5 per day, Michael Gove clearly does not understand the Stabilisation and Association Agreements in the Western Balkans. These arrangements were designed as support at the start of a journey towards EU membership and integration for relatively small, troubled economies, rather than a separation settlement for a big, successful one. Olli Rehn, who negotiated such pacts as EU enlargement commissioner, said he was \\\\\\\"surprised\\\\\\\" the Leave side would want an agreement that would put the UK \\\\\\\"permanently on the substitutes bench\\\\\\\".  Boris Johnson has a vision of the UK undertaking trade negotiations with every country and regional organisation in the world from scratch. EU trade agreements apply in the territory of its member states but if we leave the EU, we will no longer benefit from those agreements, including the 22 the EU has made with the UK's Commonwealth partners. We would no longer be covered by the negotiations with the US, Japan and other leaders in world trade now heading towards conclusion. Boris Johnson argues that the UK could quickly negotiate its own set of trade agreements to compensate. I defer to the view of Peter Sutherland, first Director General of the World Trade Organisation: \\\\\\\"This, judging from my long experience of trade negotiations, is highly unlikely. The trends are towards bloc-to-bloc negotiations. The US has confirmed that it would prefer to negotiate with the EU (with the UK in the EU, by the way).  \\\\\\\"The last in this catalogue of claims is that, if all else failed, the UK could rapidly negotiate its own trade agreement with the EU and somehow thereby replicate all the benefits of the single market. This would include \\\\\\\"passporting\\\\\\\" in financial services - the system, crucial to the City of London, by which a company based in one-member state can trade throughout the single market. Never mind that even the recently agreed EU-Canada trade deal, the most comprehensive the union has ever agreed (and seven years in the making), does not give the Canadians passporting rights.

First, the most startling fact is that the House of Commons has undertaken a significant study on this but failed to (successfully at least) publish it. One has to resort to an independent and comprehensive report from the Centre for European Policy Studies to find the outcome of the House of Commons analysis: 6.8 per cent of primary UK legislation and 13.8 per cent of UK secondary legislation had a role in implementing EU law - 20.6 per cent of legislation in total compared to the 75 per cent that we hear from prominent Leave campaigners.  Turning to the content of these EU driven laws: how do they affect our lives and would we repeal them? Most of the areas where EU laws take precedence set the business norms and standards that all nations must observe in a global economy. Some establish levels of protection for workers; others, environmental controls. In short, most of these laws we should welcome or at least accept are necessary to trade in the Single Market. They will continue to apply if we leave and want to continue to trade with Europe. I was surprised recently when Sir James Dyson and Sir Anthony Bamford - both founders and leaders of extraordinarily successful global businesses - came out in favour of Brexit. Both believe they have axes to grind on EU laws. Dyson has failed in an EU legal challenge to competitor labelling practices; Bamford has lost a six-year battle against a \\\\u20ac39 million fine by the Commission for anti-trust breaches. Whatever the merits or not of their cases, these laws will not go away if we exit and still want to continue to trade with Europe.  On many other policies the UK has opted out - the euro, Schengen (open borders) and some elements of legal and judicial affairs, for example. And on the legislation that really affects our daily lives, for instance taxes, welfare, war and peace, and national security, policy has been set by Westminster politicians. We may agree or disagree with these laws but we cannot claim they are EU driven and that we have surrendered democracy or self-government.  It is also wrong to argue, as Nigel Farage does frequently, that EU laws are imposed by unelected bureaucrats in the European Commission. The commission only proposes draft legislation. It is then adopted by the Council of Ministers, consisting of elected national governments, and the elected European Parliament. The harsh reality - an irony here for the Brexiteers - is that the House of Commons is poor when it comes to overseeing our EU policies. The unelected House of Lords actually does a much better job, as do the national parliaments in Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands for example.  Finally, sovereignty of which nation are we demanding: England and Wales? Let us be absolutely clear - a vote to leave the EU will ultimately mean a vote for Scotland to leave the UK and hence the break-up of the UK as we know it today. Both Yes and No voters in the Scottish referendum favoured EU membership. A Brexit will trigger a new Scottish referendum. Imagine Anglo-Scottish border controls along the 100 miles between Berwick or Gretna. And imagine border controls between Ireland and Northern Ireland along the 500 miles between Lough Foyle and Carlingford Lough. This used to be one of the most politically contentious borders in the world with customs posts turned into military check points. Ireland did not sign up to Schengen, preferring instead to opt for its current passport free status (shared with the Channel Islands and Isle of Man) as part of the Common Travel Area.

You see a globalized world, bursting with opportunities, and you want your state to win a slice of that big pie.  But this week, that expansive worldview is facing a test in the form of a referendum in the United Kingdom - the single largest foreign investor in the U.S. economy. Money from the U.K. makes up about 15 percent of all cumulative foreign direct investment holdings in this country.  In other words, what happens in the U.K. can make a difference here. If British companies - say BP, HSBC Bank, GlaxoSmithKline, Unilever and Prudential - are making lots of money, then they can afford to invest more here.  Sponsor Message  But the U.K.'s economic future may be changing, thanks to a decision coming on Thursday. Voters throughout the United Kingdom, including England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, will decide whether to stay in the European Union, a 28-member collection of countries with deep economic and regulatory ties.  If voters say it's time to leave, then Britain will begin the process of severing many bonds with the European continent. People have been calling that outcome \\\\\\\"Brexit.\\\\\\\"  Enlarge this image toggle caption Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP  Overwhelmingly, U.S. business leaders are pulling for the U.K. to remain. They fear such a big change might derail the U.K. economy and unravel the EU. It's easier to do business with a single, large economic entity, rather than cope with 28 different sets of rules spread over a half-billion Europeans.  Such concerns were floating in the air this week in Washington, D.C., as British investors met with state economic teams attending the two-day SelectUSA Investment Summit, sponsored by the U.S. Commerce Department. The annual event works like a speed-dating party. Each state tries its best to catch the eye of potential foreign suitors strolling the exhibit floor of the Washington Hilton.  Americans working in those booths hand out brochures (and let us be honest: candy) to attract visitors, who represent 70 foreign markets. They have good reason to work hard. Last year, this country saw a record $348 billion in foreign direct investment.  Sponsor Message  So here is a sampling of Brexit thoughts from chats with state economic development officials attending SelectUSA:  California: Brian Peck said his state's business leaders would rather see the U.K. stay in the EU \\\\\\\"for the stability of it.\\\\\\\" If the U.K. votes to leave, \\\\\\\"it could have a domino effect on Europe,\\\\\\\" creating regulatory chaos.  South Carolina: Jeremy Cauthen noted that in recent years, BMW and Volvo - both European manufacturers - have chosen South Carolina as the place to build vehicles. He did not want to take sides on Brexit specifically, but said, \\\\\\\"We do everything we can to attract investments\\\\\\\" - and it helps when European companies are prosperous and looking to expand.

In our mountains, poor forest lands management in our urban forest communities, such as Big Bear, Running Springs and Lake Arrowhead (building foundations within drip lines or right up to the trunks, trees growing through decks, paving over treed areas, etc.), has weakened trees and caused an exacerbation of bark beetle populations even in average rainfall years. The trees' natural means of expelling bark beetles is to pump sap, literally blocking the beetles in their bore holes. With the drought, the trees can not produce enough sap and the bark beetle populations have exploded from the urban forest areas out into the natural forestlands, devastating some areas with high numbers of tree mortalities.

Roy believes that these young people \\\\\\\"find in Islam the best way to express, experience, and to live their rejection of society.\\\\\\\" This theory has proved controversial among other scholars, who tend to stress the opposite: the radicalization of Islam through the spread of Salafist ideas.  I spoke by phone with Roy, who is also the author of Holy Ignorance: When Religion and Culture Part Ways. In our conversation, which has been edited and condensed, we discussed Donald Trump's strange brand of Islamophobia, how Muslims are assimilating in Europe, and what the Orlando shooter tells us about radicalism.  Isaac Chotiner: How does Omar Mateen fit into your thinking about radicalization?  Olivier Roy: The first point is that the guy is second-generation, which is the most common pattern for terrorists. The second point is that, to the extent we know-and every day we learn something new about him-he was not very religious: He was an angry man without a precise cause. One thing that is interesting is that his family was Afghan, and his father has made political statements. But he never mentioned Afghanistan during the killing. He could have said he was attacking the American people in revenge for Mullah Mansour, the Taliban leader killed by an American drone. He could have justified his anti-American stance by referring to events in Afghanistan. He did not.  Advertisement  Advertisement  Advertisement  Advertisement  This is a very common pattern among terrorists. Terrorists almost never refer to their own country or the country of origin of their parents. They usually refer to global jihad, not to concrete situations. You can be angry at the United States government for good reasons, or at least real reasons: drones, the invasion of Iraq, and so on. But these guys always refer to virtual, global jihad.  What does that signify to you?  They are not reacting to a real situation. They are not reacting to a real conflict. They are in a virtual war. The key thing about Daesh is that it has evolved to promote a narrative of global or virtual jihad: Daesh almost never mentions real conflicts. It attracts these types of guys who are what I call de-culturated and who never adjust to any society, whether it is American society or any society. It is not the revenge of the Afghans against the Americans. It is not connected to real struggles. They live in an imaginary world.  Advertisement  It sounds like you think this guy was on a path to some sort of radicalization or violence, whether or not it was through Islam.  I think that these guys do not become radicalized because they become more and more religious. It is not religious radicalization that leads to political radicalization. When they became radical, they are religious. They frame their wrath in a religious narrative. They think they will go to paradise. It is Islamization of radicalization. I think Islam is the framework of the radicalization; it is not the primary cause.

Advertisement  Advertisement  Advertisement  These guys are not Salafi. The idea that this is the Salafization of Islam does not make sense because their approach to salvation is not the Salafi approach. The Salafis do not believe in suicide. They think that suicide is a sin against God, like the Jews and the Christians. If you kill yourself or put yourself in a position where you will necessarily be killed, you preempt the will of God. But in the mind of the suicide bombers, the idea is that you do not need to be a good Muslim, you do not need to pray five times a day, you do not need to go for hajj. If you make a supreme sacrifice, you will go directly to paradise and there is no need to be strict believer.  Advertisement  If what you are saying is true, how do we stop these attacks? We often hear that the solution is to \\\\\\\"moderate\\\\\\\" Islam, but that would not seem to be the solution in the narrative you just laid out.  These guys are attracted by the narrative of Daesh. And Daesh today is the only international anti-society, anti-world order group. There is no more global international extreme left. If you take [left-wing parties] Podemos in Spain or Syriza in Greece, these movements are now anti-globalization. The only global movement now is radical Islam, which explains the number of converts-which is extraordinary. The number of converts who have joined the jihad is between 20 percent and 30 percent.  Advertisement  Advertisement  Advertisement  The issue now is to debunk the narrative of Daesh. We should penalize Daesh by not depicting it as the biggest threat to Western civilization-that condones their propaganda. The second point is that we should not allow radical Islam to have a monopoly on Islam. For that, we should let rise a normal Islam, not a moderate Islam. The concept of moderate Islam is totally misleading: You do not have moderate religion. Calvinism is not moderate. Calvin and Luther were not moderates. They were radicals. But you can have moderate believers who are not necessarily moderately believing. We should let normal Islam emerge as a religion in the public sphere. In the United States, this is easier because religion is accepted. But in Europe it is a problem. The trend in Europe is to consider any religion as a potential problem.  Advertisement  Advertisement  Is this why you think countries like France tend to have a bigger problem with radicalization than the United States?  Yes. Because the answer to radicalism in France is to marginalize religion more and more. It is to expel religion from the public space. And if you expel religion from the public space, then you give religion to the extremes and the radicals.  Advertisement  I am guessing you do not like Donald Trump's approach to Islam.  It is interesting because Trump is not a religious guy. His Islamophobia is linked with some sort of contempt of religion. That's the ambiguity of it. It is not a Christian Islamophobia. Trump does not pay lip service to religion when he attacks Islam. He does not say you can be a nice believer or anything like that. He rejects Islam as a rule and he never speaks about good religion, even Christianity.

We all know what this could mean for the economy, immigration, jobs, fishing and even VISA-free travel, but what does Brexit mean for technology?  Tech is big business for the United Kingdom. The UK's IT industry is worth \\\\u00a358 billion to the economy annually. London-based tech firms alone raised \\\\u00a31.09 billion in venture capital last year. There are 42.4 million smartphone users in the UK, and that's steadily rising. We are the world's fifth biggest economy, and technology and science make up a big part of that.

Of course the politicians can be wrong, the experts can be wrong, and the business leaders can be wrong - this is new territory. They can also be right, and some of the world's most influential technologists have been quite vocal about the EU referendum.

When it comes to Brexit, it's important to get a view of what our country's biggest technology business leaders believe will happen. It's their livelihoods on the line, after all.  It's no surprise that the Remain camp has garnered the lion's share of support from big business. The majority of UK exports to the EU, across both services and manufacturing, can largely (though not exclusively) be sourced to the major corporations.

So we have heard from big business, but there is more to the UK economy that giant corporations. What does the UK's booming tech start-up sector have to say about the prospect of Brexit?  Well, it seems that the vast majority of start-ups are keen to stay in the EU. A recent study by Coadec found that 81% of people in the digital start-up sector are hoping for a Remain vote. The sample size was 175, including 126 start-up founders, 26 start-up employees, 19 investors, and four others.  The study revealed that the key issues for the Remainers were:  Access to a large single market, with harmonised regulations  Free movement of labour, giving access to a talented workforce  Having a 'seat at the table'  Stability and security  The key issues for Leavers, meanwhile, were:  Sovereignty  Over-regulation and red tape  \\\\\\\"These results are not surprising,\\\\\\\" explains Coadec in its survey analysis. \\\\\\\"The UK's start-up community is international in its outlook and in its composition. Founders come to the UK from across Europe (and the world) to launch and grow their businesses. They look to Europe for talented staff to help them grow. And they aim to sell and expand across a trading block of 500 million consumers.\\\\\\\"  The Coadec survey is not alone in its findings, either. A survey from Tech London Advocates found 87% of start-ups wanted to remain, while research by techUK found that 71% wanted to remain in a reformed EU.  In fact, a Brexit vote could be felt very acutely by many of the UK's tech start-ups. That's because of the uncertainty over immigration legislation and the possible loss of free movement of labour.  Robert Newry, who founded technology recruitment service Arctic Shores, believes that the current interest in UK start-ups will \\\\\\\"dry up\\\\\\\" if we leave the EU:  \\\\\\\" We currently have 14 employees, four are European, three of whom are first-generation . We need multi-lingual staff and we can not find all the expertise we need from within the UK. Brexit would cause us not just hiring issues, but contract and revenue ones too.\\\\\\\"  Today, Britain's EU membership guarantees free movement of people. But if we leave, there is a chance that the UK could place new restrictions on who can enter and leave the UK. However, if the UK negotiates access to the single market post-Brexit, it's highly likely we'd have to accept free movement of labour as a caveat anyway.  Alex Hemsley, who co-founded Global M, an international technology recruitment start-up based in London, said that being in the EU makes it much easier to hire people in the tech sector:  \\\\\\\"The great thing about being a member of the EU when it comes to hiring is that the search for talent is not constrained by borders or hindered by red tape and therefore startups are free to concentrate on sourcing the best talent quickly and efficiently to", "output": "{\"topical_attitudes\": [{\"source\": {\"entity\": \"Sir James Dyson\", \"references\": [\"Sir James Dyson\"]}, \"target\": {\"topic\": \"Brexit\", \"references\": [\"Brexit\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"Sir James Dyson said that the UK would \\\"create more wealth and more jobs by being outside the EU than we will within it\\\".\"], \"attitude\": \"Positive\"}, {\"source\": {\"entity\": \"Coadec\", \"references\": [\"Coadec\"]}, \"target\": {\"topic\": \"Brexit\", \"references\": [\"Brexit\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"The key issues for the Remainers were: Access to a large single market, with harmonised regulations, Free movement of labour, giving access to a talented workforce, Having a 'seat at the table', Stability and security\"], \"attitude\": \"Negative\"}, {\"source\": {\"entity\": \"Robert Newry\", \"references\": [\"Robert Newry\"]}, \"target\": {\"topic\": \"Brexit\", \"references\": [\"Brexit\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"Robert Newry... believes that the current interest in UK start-ups will \\\"dry up\\\" if we leave the EU\"], \"attitude\": \"Negative\"}, {\"source\": {\"entity\": \"Alex Hemsley\", \"references\": [\"Alex Hemsley\"]}, \"target\": {\"topic\": \"Brexit\", \"references\": [\"Brexit\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"Alex Hemsley... said that being in the EU makes it much easier to hire people in the tech sector\"], \"attitude\": \"Negative\"}], \"entity_attitudes\": [{\"entity1\": {\"entity\": \"Sir James Dyson\", \"references\": [\"Sir James Dyson\"]}, \"entity2\": {\"entity\": \"EU\", \"references\": [\"EU\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"Sir James Dyson said that the UK would \\\"create more wealth and more jobs by being outside the EU than we will within it\\\".\"], \"attitude\": \"Negative\"}, {\"entity1\": {\"entity\": \"Coadec\", \"references\": [\"Coadec\"]}, \"entity2\": {\"entity\": \"EU\", \"references\": [\"EU\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"The UK's start-up community is international in its outlook and in its composition.

Bolton argues that the only thing worse for fundraising than a declining economy is an uncertain one, and that Brexit is likely to cause both: \\\\\\\"Venture capitalists will look at more certain, stable economies and avoid pouring money into London.\\\\\\\"  Investment in science research    Technology is not just about business, though. The UK is one of the largest recipients of research funding in the EU, which has significant impact on science and tech.  According to the Royal Society, we receive a greater amount of EU research funding than we contribute. Between 2007 and 2013, we received 8.8 billion euros for research, development, and innovation activities. It's estimated that we contributed around 5.4 billion euros to Europe's research coffers in return.  Naturally, scientists welcome this cash, which might explain a Nature poll that revealed 83.46% of researchers oppose Brexit, regardless of whether they intend to vote. A further 4.63% are unsure, and 11.91% want to leave the EU. And even amongst researchers that intend to vote, 80% are against leaving the EU.  Professor Stephen Hawking called the prospect of Brexit a \\\\\\\"disaster for UK science\\\\\\\" in a letter to the Times newspaper, signed by over 150 fellows of the Royal Society. The letter reads:  \\\\\\\" First, increased funding has raised greatly the level of European science as a whole and of the UK in particular because we have a competitive edge. Second, we now recruit many of our best researchers from continental Europe, including younger ones who have obtained EU grants and have chosen to move with them here.\\\\\\\"  However, Professor Angus Dalgleish, of St George's Hospital at the University of London, who is campaigning for Brexit, argues:  \\\\\\\"We are standing up against what is a very large body of people who feel that if we leave the EU it will be a disaster for funding and collaboration - and we completely refute that. The bottom line is that we put far more into Europe than we get out. Any difference we can more than easily make up with the money we would save.\\\\\\\"  However, it's not actually guaranteed that the government would match the EU's research spending if we vote for Brexit on Thursday. There is a real risk that the recouped funds could be used elsewhere, leaving tech research high and dry.  How would Brexit affect technology for the average person?  If you are not spending your days in a Shoreditch caf\\\\u00e9, churning out 'game-changer' apps by the dozen, you have to wonder how the EU's impact on technology affects the average person.  Well, to answer the age-old question of what has the EU ever done for us, here's a quick run-down:  Scrapping EU roaming charges  Last year, the European Union announced plans to lower the price cap on roaming charges as of April 30, 2016. Better still, roaming charges across Europe will be scrapped entirely from 2017. That means you can not be charged extra for using your phone texts, minutes, or data when travelling within the European Union.  That's an impressive feat, and here's why. Unlike the USA, Europe's phone market is hugely complex and fragmented, so getting them to operate on a level playing field is very difficult.

And you care about this, apparently. Research from Broadband Genie recently revealed that 74% of Brits think it's important for the government to negotiate a deal to eliminate European roaming charges in the event of a Brexit.  European Union has scrapped roaming charges across EU (Coming 2017)  Rob Hilborn, Head of Strategy at Broadband Genie, said:  \\\\\\\"Like much of the EU debate, it's hard to cut through the political rhetoric and find hard facts, and that's no different when it comes to roaming. What is clear is that, regardless of the results on June 23, consumers are demanding the abolishment of EU roaming charges.\\\\\\\"  Holding corporations to account  The European Commission, the executive arm of the EU, is also an excellent body for holding corporations to account.  The UK, by comparison, has been less successful. Earlier this year, Chancellor George Osborne came under fire after calling the UK's tax deal with Google a \\\\\\\"major success\\\\\\\", despite backlash against the \\\\u00a3130 million agreements leniency.  But the EU has no qualms about putting pressure on Google. Earlier this year, the Commission formally charged Google with unlawfully \\\\\\\"preventing competition\\\\\\\" in the mobile (read: Android) and search (read: Google) markets. There is still some deliberation to go through, but the result could a fine against Google for 10% of its global turnover. Considering its annual revenue in 2015 was $74.5 billion, that's no small sum.  Without the EU, it would be much harder for countries to organise collective pressure on multi-national monopolies.  Protecting privacy  The EU also acts as a buffer against national governments trying to infringe the rights of their citizens. Richard Patterson, the director of security, privacy and comparison website Comparitech, puts it neatly:  \\\\\\\"While the in-out debates have focused mostly on immigration, spending and so forth, it's also important that the public gives consideration to their right to privacy. The UK's proposed Investigatory Powers bill - or Snooper's Charter - would make it easier for the government to snoop on its citizens, but so far the EU courts have been holding the bill back as it is at odds with European Law. Without this protection, the public's privacy could quite literally be at the stake.\\\\\\\"  Patterson added that we could end up in a situation where British citizens have \\\\\\\"far less protections than their EU counterparts\\\\\\\".  Summary  The UK was split nearly 50/50 on Brexit, but the same certainly is not true of the technology sector. It seems that, on balance, Britain's tech and science industries would have liked us to stay in Europe, and that makes sense. Much of the UK's technology industry is based in London, a city that has benefited massively from the European Union. But in small towns far detached from the hi-tech capital, it's likely that the benefits are less conspicuous.  Nevertheless, almost everyone gains from research in science and technology, and rulings like the abandonment of EU roaming charges are hard to gloss over. Had the referendum only been open to geeks, a Brexit vote just would not have happened. Fact.  It seems that contrary to popular belief, sometimes, computer says yes.

It's not only the UK, which is 2.4 percent of the global economy. It's what would happen if the UK opts out, and that then triggers a lot of other European countries to consider opting out. That would obstruct trade, diminish economic flows and hurt the overall global economy along with our own. What we have learned is that there is no Las Vegas in the global economy. Anything that happens abroad can wash up on our own shores, sometimes with a vengeance.\\\\\\\"  On what the US has to lose or gain if the \\\\\\\"Brexit\\\\\\\" vote passes  \\\\\\\"What the US has to lose, is the UK will not be as strong of a trading partner as it once was and it's also played a critical role in diplomatic ties because they do speak English, and we have a lot of similarities. They have been very influential in the rest of Europe with us diplomatically, and then breaking their ties with the rest of Europe would also diminish our ties with the rest of Europe.\\\\\\\"  On the potential diplomatic ramifications of \\\\\\\"Brexit\\\\\\\" for the U.S.  \\\\\\\"That is one of the concerns is that if Britain does not have the same role that it does by severing its ties with the rest of the European Union, what we would do is we would lose some of our strength because it is funneled through Britain.  In the wake of the Great Depression, it was these kinds of policies where everyone was for themselves that led to World War II. What the fear is is that we will leave everyone worse off economically by breaking apart, that we are stronger together, the economies are stronger together, and that that will increase tensions across the globe.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"There is no Las Vegas in the global economy.

London is a major financial center, which would be challenged dramatically. We do a lot of business with London that would hurt us as well. It'd likely move to Frankfurt and then we'd have to see from there where would it go. Centralizing some of these things makes it easier, more efficient for the global economy.  Of course, there is also been problems with globalization. The backlash we are seeing in the UK today is no different than the backlash we are seeing in the United States from immigration to trade. It's a very hard political sell, even though of all the countries out there, the UK has benefited more from immigration boosting its productivity growth with more educated immigrants.

In front of a crowd of 6,000, three Remain debaters - London Mayor Sadiq Khan, Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson, and General Secretary of the Trades Union Congress Frances O'Grady - faced off against Vote Leave's Boris Johnson, Minister of State for Energy Andrea Leadsom, and Labour MP Gisela Stuart. The televised debate was moderated by the BBC's David Dimbleby.  The referendum campaign has been marked by a new civility following the assassination of MP Jo Cox last week, but you might not have guessed it from the tenor of the debate. The Remain side wasted no time in attacking the allegedly misleading campaign materials and claims of their opponents. Khan held up a Vote Leave leaflet that suggested Iraq and Syria would soon share the same border with the E.U.

Amid a flurry of contacts between EU capitals to prepare for the consequences of Thursday's referendum, Hollande said he would visit Berlin next week to prepare joint initiatives to relaunch Europe, whatever the outcome of the British vote. \\\\\\\"If the choice is to leave the EU ... that would be irreversible,\\\\\\\" Hollande said. \\\\\\\"No is no, there is no middle ground and we will have to draw all the consequences.\\\\\\\" The economic consequences of the vote are key to the outcome of the referendum, with access to the bloc's single market for trade in goods and services a major issue. Hollande, in his starkest warning to date on the consequences of Brexit, said: \\\\\\\"There would be a very serious risk of Britain losing its access to the single market and everything that goes with the European economic area. Everyone needs to be well aware of this.\\\\\\\" While Norway is part of the single market via a trade deal it has with the EU, fellow non-EU member Switzerland only has access to parts of the single market. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker added his own warning, saying there would be no re-negotiation of a package of measures that EU governments agreed with London in February aimed at keeping Britain in the 28-nation bloc. Hollande's call to relaunch Europe, Brexit or no, was echoed by both Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico, who met the French leader in Paris on Wednesday, and by Polish Prime Minister Beata Szydlo during a visit to Berlin. \\\\\\\"We hope very much that the British want to remain in the EU. But irrespective of the result, our position is clear: the European Union should develop further,\\\\\\\" Szydlo told a joint news conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin. Hollande, who also met Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Lofven on Wednesday and spoke by phone with European Council President Donald Tusk and Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, said there would probably be more summits of EU leaders than the one already scheduled for June 28.. \\\\\\\"We will have to take initiatives to bring hope back for European people. Today, doubts are creeping in everywhere, populism, nationalism are taking over,\\\\\\\" French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault told parliament. Far-right party leader Marine Le Pen, who according to opinion polls could top the first round of the 2017 French presidential election but then lose the run-off, has been pressing for France to hold its own referendum on EU membership. \\\\\\\"France has a thousand more reasons to leave the EU than Britain,\\\\\\\" she told TF1 television late on Monday, referring to French membership of the euro currency and Schengen border-free area. \\\\\\\"I want a referendum in France. All EU countries should have a referendum.\\\\\\\" British Prime Minister David Cameron and his eurosceptic opponents made final pitches for wavering voters on Wednesday on the referendum, with the outcome still too close to call.

But the Brexit could have could have legitimate implications for a more niche interest group: art collectors.    \\\\\\\"In periods of market uncertainty, we tend to see collectors seek out well known blue chip names over younger, more emerging artists, as these are seen to be stronger investments and less risky,\\\\\\\" says Jacqueline Towers-Perkins, a specialist in post-war and contemporary art at artnet auctions. \\\\\\\"So that could be something to bear in mind with these potential changes happening.\\\\\\\"    In other words, the market uncertainty stemming from a possible Brexit could influence high-end art connoisseurs to stick with established folks rather than experiment on up-and-coming artists.    The EU referendum vote on Thursday happens to fall between Sotheby's (BID) major impressionist and modern art sale, which was Tuesday, and its contemporary sale on June 28. Christie's major sales will be held on Friday and June 29.    Towers-Perkins has not seen any change in bidder interest on her site, though. \\\\\\\"People are still buying and selling in the same way and still looking for the pieces that they are searching for in the same way that they have always had,\\\\\\\" she says.    Still, in a note to clients, Consumer Edge Research's Dave Schick cautioned that \\\\\\\"political concerns are global in nature\\\\\\\" and the Brexit vote will \\\\\\\"likely [have] some impact on consignment wins for major auction houses.\\\\\\\"    But it's not clear whether a Britain's potential exit from the EU would encourage people to buy or sell art. According to a Bloomberg survey of economists, the British pound will move one way or another depending on how the vote goes. The economists found the currency will either sink to the lowest level in more than 30 years if the \\\\\\\"leave\\\\\\\" camp wins or potentially climb 6% to its highest level so far this year if the \\\\\\\"remain\\\\\\\" camp prevails.    And this week in an opinion piece in The Guardian George Soros sounded the alarm that the pound will plummet if Britain leaves the EU.    Schick says the volatility in currency markets would leave \\\\\\\"collectors in the UK largely unaffected\\\\\\\" but would make an impact on foreign bidders, who would be able to use the pound's potential weakness in their favor.    Ultimately, though, high-end art collectors may be more influenced by their own tastes than outside market forces.    \\\\\\\"There might be some fluctuations in the market but I think ultimately if collectors continue to buy what they love and continue to hold onto the pieces that they have loved, I think the market is not going to affect people's collection and buying and selling habits too much,\\\\\\\" says Towers-Perkins.

Denne gjennomgangen gir deg en enkel innf\\\\u00f8ring i hvordan prisene p\\\\u00e5 et usikret l\\\\u00e5n fastsettes. Hvis du vil vite mer om bruksomr\\\\u00e5der s\\\\u00e5 klikker her.

Tidligere var denne grensen p\\\\u00e5 15 \\\\u00e5r. Rask nedbetaling l\\\\u00f8nner seg, og de nye reglene er et grep myndighetene har tatt for \\\\u00e5 redusere antallet mennesker som f\\\\u00e5r langvarige gjeldsproblemer.    Unntaket er dersom du l\\\\u00e5ner for \\\\u00e5 refinansiere dyrere gjeld. I s\\\\u00e5 fall er tidsbegrensningen for nedbetaling satt til maksimum 15 \\\\u00e5r, slik det ogs\\\\u00e5 var tidligere. Imidlertid avhenger dette av hvilken nedbetalingstid du allerede har p\\\\u00e5 gjelden som skal refinansieres. Den lengste nedbetalingstiden som gjelder der, er den lengste du vil kunne f\\\\u00e5 p\\\\u00e5 det nye l\\\\u00e5net du bruker til refinansiering.    Viktig \\\\u00e5 vite om rentebetingelsene  Credit card - online shopping and payments  Nesten samtlige banker som tilbyr forbruksl\\\\u00e5n uten sikkerhet i en eller annen variant, opererer med et temmelig vidt spektrum n\\\\u00e5r det gjelder rentene. Det vil si at de laveste nominelle rentene kan v\\\\u00e6re nede i omtrent 6% til 7%, mens de h\\\\u00f8yeste kan v\\\\u00e6re oppe i over 20%.    Hver enkelt s\\\\u00f8knad blir behandlet individuelt, noe som omfatter rentetilbudet til hver enkelt. Personer med god betalingshistorikk og god betalingsevne f\\\\u00e5r bedre renter enn n\\\\u00e5r tilfellet er motsatt. Du vet derfor ikke hva l\\\\u00e5net koster deg f\\\\u00f8r du har s\\\\u00f8kt og f\\\\u00e5tt et tilbud. Dette tilbudet er helt uforpliktende.    Opp Finans er en mulighet  Denne banken er en del av Gjensidige Bank, som p\\\\u00e5 sin side er en del av Gjensidige Forsikring. OPP Finans er blant de eldste bankene som spesialiserer seg p\\\\u00e5 forbrukerfinansiering, og ogs\\\\u00e5 en av de absolutt st\\\\u00f8rste akt\\\\u00f8rene. Banken legger mye prestisje i \\\\u00e5 v\\\\u00e6re en p\\\\u00e5litelig og trygg akt\\\\u00f8r. De foretar grundig risikovurdering for \\\\u00e5 unng\\\\u00e5 \\\\u00e5 yte l\\\\u00e5n som l\\\\u00e5ntakeren vil slite med \\\\u00e5 klare tilbakebetalingen p\\\\u00e5.    L\\\\u00e5nest\\\\u00f8rrelse: 10 000 til 500 000 kroner  Nominelle renter: fra 7,50%  Etableringsgebyr: 950 kroner (650 kroner for eksisterende kunder)  Termingebyr: 50 kroner  L\\\\u00e5netid: inntil 5 \\\\u00e5r  Du kan ha medl\\\\u00e5ntaker p\\\\u00e5 et forbruksl\\\\u00e5n fra OPP Finans, og banken tilbyr s\\\\u00e5kalt l\\\\u00e5neforsikring. Har du en medl\\\\u00e5ntaker blir begge personer ansvarlige for l\\\\u00e5net, noe som gj\\\\u00f8r det enklere \\\\u00e5 f\\\\u00e5 det innvilget. L\\\\u00e5neforsikring er noe de f\\\\u00e6rreste trenger. Sett deg n\\\\u00f8ye inn i vilk\\\\u00e5rene f\\\\u00f8r du tegner slike forsikringer.    Santander Bank  Santander Consumer Bank er kanskje ikke s\\\\u00e5 kjent i Norge, men dette er faktisk en av de st\\\\u00f8rste bankene i Europa. Her p\\\\u00e5 berget tilbyr Santander flere typer kredittkort, store og sm\\\\u00e5 forbruksl\\\\u00e5n med ulike betingelser, og finansiering av kj\\\\u00f8ret\\\\u00f8y med og uten pantesikring.

Derfor er det ikke sikkert Santander alltid blir billigere enn banker som har gebyrer ogs\\\\u00e5 p\\\\u00e5 l\\\\u00e5nesummer under 70 000 kroner. Her som ellers gjelder det \\\\u00e5 innhente mange tilbud, og s\\\\u00e5 velge det billigste alternativet.  Tilbudet hos Instabank  Instabank er relativt ny p\\\\u00e5 markedet for usikrede forbruksl\\\\u00e5n. Banken er helnorsk med utspring fra Stavangeromr\\\\u00e5det. Utvalget av produkter gj\\\\u00f8r at Instabank er nesten for en vanlig nettbasert sparebank \\\\u00e5 regne. Sparekontoene de tilbyr har gode rentebetingelser, du kan forsikre deg via banken, og de tilbyr to typer l\\\\u00e5n uten sikkerhet. I tillegg tilbyr Instabank et relativt billig bill\\\\u00e5n uten sikkerhet.    L\\\\u00e5nest\\\\u00f8rrelse: 5 000 til 500 000 kroner  Nominelle renter: fra 7,99%  Etableringsgebyr: 900 kroner  Termingebyr: 40 kroner  L\\\\u00e5netid: inntil 5 \\\\u00e5r for nedbetalingsl\\\\u00e5n (forbruksl\\\\u00e5n), ikke relevant for fleksibelt l\\\\u00e5n  Hos Instabank kan du alts\\\\u00e5 velge mellom vanlig forbruksl\\\\u00e5n med inntil 5 \\\\u00e5r nedbetaling, eller fleksibelt l\\\\u00e5n. Sistnevnte er en brukskreditt, det vil si den fungerer p\\\\u00e5 noenlunde samme vis som et kredittkort. Du f\\\\u00e5r innvilget en l\\\\u00e5neramme, men betaler renter bare for den delen du selv velger \\\\u00e5 disponere eller bruke. Ubenyttet kreditt er kostnadsfritt. L\\\\u00e5net har derfor ingen fast nedbetalingsplan. Du m\\\\u00e5 betale en minimumsprosent av eventuell benyttet kreditt per m\\\\u00e5ned i avdrag, eller st\\\\u00f8rre avdrag om du selv vil.    Fleksible l\\\\u00e5n er ypperlige alternativer n\\\\u00e5r du er usikker p\\\\u00e5 hvor stort l\\\\u00e5n du trenger, for eksempel ved oppussing. Faren ved l\\\\u00e5netypen er imidlertid at de krever st\\\\u00f8rre disiplin (lett tilgang til midler betyr overforbruk i mange tilfeller).    Finansiering via Optin Bank  Dette er en av de nyeste norske bankene p\\\\u00e5 markedet for forbruksl\\\\u00e5n uten sikkerhet. Optin Bank tilbyr sm\\\\u00e5 og store l\\\\u00e5n, l\\\\u00e5n til refinansiering, samt sparekonto med konkurransedyktige innskuddsrenter. Banken er s\\\\u00e5ledes sikret gjennom medlemskap i Bankenes sikringsfond (alle norske banker er medlemmer i fondet).

WSP Global Inc., an engineering services company with offices in 40 countries, is another stock to consider, he said. If the U.K. votes to stick with the EU, Belisle will consider Canadian and U.S. banks amid \\\\\\\"more widespread buying\\\\\\\" as the overhang of Brexit concern fades. In such a scenario, global stocks could gain about 5 per cent over several days, with the S&P/TSX having as much as 8 per cent upside. With investors paying a premium for protection against calamity in the equity market, this presents an opportunity for options investors to take advantage by buying cheap calls if Brexit fails, according to Hans Albrecht, a fund manager at Horizons ETFs Management Canada Inc. A measure of the spread in prices between 1-month bullish and bearish options, or skew, in the iShares S&P/TSX 60 Index exchange-traded fund, the largest, most liquid ETF in Canada, jumped to the highest level since 2011 Wednesday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Even after the S&P/TSX rally this year, the too-close-to-call outcome of the vote and the low cost of contracts that pay in the event Canadian shares rise make now the time to boost bullish bets, Albrecht said.

Implied volatility, a measure of options activity, in Comex July gold calls and puts with strike prices that are as much as $50 higher or lower than current prices soared to record highs on Wednesday.  A vote for Brexit is expected to spur a rush to safe haven assets like bullion.  The frenzied deal-making and diverging strike prices suggested duelling forces as investors grew nervous about the potential impact of the vote on the market - prices could fall or rise by as much as 5 per cent.  It was most evident in bullish bets. COMEX July gold calls that give the holder the option to buy at $1,300 per ounce  and $1,325 were some of the most actively traded on the day.  Activity in July puts with strike prices of $1,200  and $1,220 was also almost as busy. They all expire on Monday.  Combined turnover in the four contracts equated to close to 638,000 ounces of bullion worth more than $800 million.  Spot gold prices fell for the third straight session on Wednesday, dropping to a two-week low of $1,261.01 per ounce.  Implied volatility typically rises ahead of expiry, but traders said deal-making has been more pronounced than usual, amid heightened risk appetite and nervousness about the result, traders said.  \\\\\\\"We are at a line in the sand on which way we are going to go and that's why we are seeing implied volatility in puts and calls spike right now,\\\\\\\" said Adam Packard, vice president operations at brokerage Zaner Group in Chicago.  Tai Wong, director of base and precious metals trading for BMO Capital Markets in New York, said flight to safe haven amid uncertainty over Brexit could push prices to as high as $1,375, the loftiest since March 2014.  An \\\\\\\"In\\\\\\\" vote is seen as quickly unwinding gold's 5-percent gain in June, as appetite for risk rises and focus returns to the US economy.  Prices hit their highest since August 2014 last week as the $5-trillion-a-year gold market rose with other \\\\\\\"safe\\\\\\\" assets, such as German bunds, the Swiss franc and Japan's yen.  Premiums of some out-of-the-money calls were more than two times the cost of out-of-the-money puts, suggesting a more bullish sentiment, said Packard.", "output": "{\"topical_attitudes\": [{\"source\": {\"topic\": \"Brexit\", \"references\": [\"Brexit\"]}, \"target\": {\"topic\": \"gold market\", \"references\": [\"gold prices\", \"gold\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"A vote for Brexit is expected to spur a rush to safe haven assets like bullion.\"], \"attitude\": \"Positive\"}, {\"source\": {\"topic\": \"Brexit\", \"references\": [\"Brexit\"]}, \"target\": {\"topic\": \"European Union membership\", \"references\": [\"European Union membership\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"Britons head to the polls to decide on the future of their European Union membership on Thursday.\"], \"attitude\": \"Neutral\"}], \"entity_attitudes\": [{\"entity1\": {\"entity\": \"Adam Packard\", \"references\": [\"Adam Packard\"]}, \"entity2\": {\"entity\": \"Zaner Group\", \"references\": [\"Zaner Group\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"Adam Packard, vice president operations at brokerage Zaner Group in Chicago.\"], \"attitude\": \"Neutral\"}, {\"entity1\": {\"entity\": \"Tai Wong\", \"references\": [\"Tai Wong\"]}, \"entity2\": {\"entity\": \"BMO Capital Markets\", \"references\": [\"BMO Capital Markets\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"Tai Wong, director of base and precious metals trading for BMO Capital Markets in New York.\"], \"attitude\": \"Neutral\"}, {\"entity1\": {\"entity\": \"Adam Packard\", \"references\": [\"Adam Packard\"]}, \"entity2\": {\"entity\": \"Tai Wong\", \"references\": [\"Tai Wong\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"Adam Packard, vice president operations at brokerage Zaner Group in Chicago.

Bidenkap said he was hoping for a more intellectual, perhaps even philosophical, discussion of the question U.K. citizens will decide Thursday: whether to leave the European Union.  \\\\\\\"I expected there would be more civility, politeness, I guess,\\\\\\\" Bidenkap said over pints at a pub near his apartment in London's Notting Hill section. \\\\\\\"I expected the conversation to be of a higher level.\\\\\\\"  Instead, he found what he called the same kind of scare tactics, particularly focused on immigrants and Muslims.

Feeling Left Behind  Luntz, who is in London for the referendum, said Trump and Brexiteers like Farage appeal to people who have never quite recovered from the global financial crisis and feel abandoned by establishment politicians.  Americans \\\\\\\"believe that the political system and economic system is rigged against them,\\\\\\\" said Luntz. \\\\\\\"That same sentiment is happening in Britain with about 70 percent believing

{"instruction": "Extract attitudes between entities and topics from the article in JSON format and categorize them [Positive, Neutral, Negative] and justify them quoting the article", "input": "I have now spent the last three weeks fact-checking every detail on Brexit that I possibly could.  I have read 90-page government reports on my way to a wedding. I have hacked through academic analyses of the EU when I really should have been promoting my Virtual Reality game. I have treated myself to a fun Google search for the accounts of pro-Remain activists to check that they are not biased. And so on.  (Here are all the posts I wrote as a result. )  It has been surprisingly interesting, in some ways. And frustrating in others.  But that's not what you care about.  You care about who's telling the truth, who is not, and who you should vote for.  So who's more reliable?  I came into this leaning cautiously to Remain. However, I really hoped to find that my initial impressions of Leave were wildly wrong, and I was hoping they had very strong arguments.  Why? Because the country might vote for Leave. And if that happens I'd much rather be saying \\\\\\\"well, at the end of the day both sides have a good point\\\\\\\" than \\\\\\\"oh god, oh god, we are in real trouble now\\\\\\\".  Unfortunately, \\\\\\\"well, at the end of the day both sides have a good point\\\\\\\" is not what I found.  Leave's Reliability  At every single turn, I found that the Leave campaign's arguments were founded on lies. Sorry, it's as simple as that. I wish it wasn't.  They lie about how much money we spend on the EU. I'd love to say \\\\\\\"they are misinformed\\\\\\\", or \\\\\\\"they exaggerate\\\\\\\", but they do not. They lie. Outright.  They lie about the business case for Leave. I still have found absolutely no support whatsoever for the figures that are confidently quoted here.  They lie about the state of democracy in the EU. The more I investigate the EU, the more I find out it's fairer and better set up than the UK's government. Just today I discovered that the European Commission's role in legislation is actually far more balanced than I thought.  And the Leave campaign lie a lot more. I have not had time to post all the mini-fact-checks I have found. As just one example, the Vote Leave website claims  Because of free movement laws, the UK cannot test every EU doctor operating in the UK for whether they can speak English  As proof, they link to an article in the Guardian about a horrible accident thanks to a doctor not understanding English. In that article, it explicitly states:  The GMC, which registers doctors and licenses them to work, has been able to check EU medics' English since last summer\\\\u2026  In other words, Leave's statement is absolutely untrue, and that's proved by an article they themselves use as \\\\\\\"proof\\\\\\\" of their untrue statement.  I have not had time to fact-check every single Leave claim, and some, like the claim that leaving \\\\\\\"will make Britain Great again\\\\\\\", are not possible to fact-check.  But every single Leave claim I have checked has turned out not to be exaggeration, not to be well-meaning misunderstanding, but to be obviously false.  Remain's Reliability  Remain's campaign has been criticised for being dull, being negative, and being led by people who are thoroughly disliked.  All of those claims are entirely reasonable. Personally I intensely dislike both Cameron and Osborne. I am about as much of a fan of the current UK government as I am of bowel cancer.

It is a fitting moment to consider what the Brexit vote means, what it will mean to the future of Europe, and what it may tell us about the future of politics in America and throughout the democratic world.

See all of our newsletters  Whether the Leave or Remain group wins the vote in Britain will be a seismic moment in European history, possibly the most important European moment since the 1940s. To the degree that this column considers the implications of the Brexit vote for American politics, which could be significant, what follows is not a statement of preference (my preference in the presidential campaign is well known) but an analysis of the political, economic and cultural trends in the United States and Europe which, with regard to the issues surrounding the Brexit vote, are very similar.  Throughout the democratic world, and particularly in the United States and Europe, there is a tidal wave of public revulsion against political and financial establishments of all kinds. There is a deep wellspring of economic anxiety from citizens who feel their economic wellbeing is threatened by a cold and impersonal economy in which they worry about being left behind. There is a widespread feeling, backed up by economic data, that most citizens keep falling behind as their wages and incomes lag below the true increase in their cost of living.  There is also, throughout the United States and Europe, a feeling that their countries are besieged by immigration from people of different cultures and backgrounds which also has the effect of threatening their livelihood by bringing large numbers of new low-wage workers to the workforce.  And there is a feeling that the world economy has brought a race to the bottom, where jobs are exported to lower-wage nations in an economy where the rules are fixed and the deck is stacked against the common man and woman, and in favor of financial establishments and elites who wield power over political and government establishments.  In both America and Europe there is the omnipresent threat of terrorism, which is related to the intense issue of immigration. To complicate matters further, Russian strongman Vladimir Putin has become increasingly aggressive, and the more Europe becomes divided the greater the danger from Putin, who would gain strength from a European breakup.  Finally, there is a widespread feeling that events have spun out of control, that national sovereignty has lost its meaning, that events are in the saddle and riding mankind.  Throughout Europe these sentiments have incited enormous anger against establishments of all kinds that motivates both the left and the right and has increasing appeal to the center.  If the Leave forces prevail it will give a lift to Trump, which is not being reported in American media today but will be widely reported in the aftermath.  In Britain this sentiment manifests itself in support for the Leave group in the Brexit debate. In America it manifests itself in the huge unpopularity of politicians of all varieties and the staggering unpopularity of Congress which is disapproved by nearly 80 percent of all", "output": "{\"topical_attitudes\": [{\"source\": {\"topic\": \"Brexit vote\", \"references\": [\"Brexit\", \"Brexit vote\"]}, \"target\": {\"topic\": \"future of Europe\", \"references\": [\"future of Europe\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"it is a fitting moment to consider what the Brexit vote means, what it will mean to the future of Europe\"], \"attitude\": \"Neutral\"}, {\"source\": {\"topic\": \"Brexit vote\", \"references\": [\"Brexit\", \"Brexit vote\"]}, \"target\": {\"topic\": \"future of politics in America\", \"references\": [\"future of politics in America\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"it may tell us about the future of politics in America\"], \"attitude\": \"Neutral\"}, {\"source\": {\"topic\": \"Brexit vote\", \"references\": [\"Brexit\", \"Brexit vote\"]}, \"target\": {\"topic\": \"political, economic, and cultural trends\", \"references\": [\"political, economic and cultural trends\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"an analysis of the political, economic and cultural trends in the United States and Europe which, with regard to the issues surrounding the Brexit vote, are very similar\"], \"attitude\": \"Neutral\"}, {\"source\": {\"topic\": \"Brexit vote\", \"references\": [\"Brexit\", \"Brexit vote\"]}, \"target\": {\"topic\": \"American politics\", \"references\": [\"American politics\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"what follows is an analysis of the political, economic and cultural trends in the United States and Europe which, with regard to the issues surrounding the Brexit vote, are very similar\"], \"attitude\": \"Neutral\"}, {\"source\": {\"topic\": \"Leave group\", \"references\": [\"Leave group\"]}, \"target\": {\"topic\": \"Brexit\", \"references\": [\"Brexit\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"If the Leave forces prevail it will give a lift to Trump\"], \"attitude\": \"Positive\"}], \"entity_attitudes\": [{\"entity1\": {\"entity\": \"Donald Trump\", \"references\": [\"Trump\"]}, \"entity2\": {\"entity\": \"Leave group\", \"references\": [\"Leave group\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"If the Leave forces prevail it will give a lift to Trump\"], \"attitude\": \"Positive\"}, {\"entity1\": {\"entity\": \"Vladimir Putin\", \"references\": [\"Vladimir Putin\", \"Putin\"]}, \"entity2\": {\"entity\": \"Europe\", \"references\": [\"Europe\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"Russian strongman Vladimir Putin has become increasingly aggressive, and the more Europe becomes divided the greater the danger from Putin\"], \"attitude\": \"Negative\"}, {\"entity1\": {\"entity\": \"Vladimir Putin\", \"references\": [\"Vladimir Putin\", \"Putin\"]}, \"entity2\": {\"entity\": \"European breakup\", \"references\": [\"European breakup\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"the more Europe becomes divided the greater the danger from Putin, who would gain strength from a European breakup\"], \"attitude\": \"Negative\"}]}"}

In the presidential campaign this spirit of anxiety, anger and insurgency has manifested itself in the surprisingly strong showing of Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders, both of whom \\\\\\\"get it\\\\\\\"-but come at the problem from (in most cases) widely differing points of view. Hillary Clinton, I would add, is fundamentally a bystander in the great divide between populists and establishments, trying to maneuver between the two camps, unlike Trump and Sanders, who are both clearly aligned with the anti-establishment camp.  Personally I am very strongly on the Remain side of Brexit, though I fully understand the forces that drive the Leave side. I have had long relationships with Europe, going back to my days in law school where I studied for a semester at St. Edmund Hall at Oxford, and post-law school, where I received a degree from the London School of Economics. During the 1980s I participated in the European Visitors Program, the counterpart to the State Department's Young Leaders program, where I met with high level officials of Britain, France, Germany and the European Union in Brussels and Strasbourg.  If the Leave group prevails there is a real question whether the European Union could break apart. There would be an escalation of other movements to leave the EU in nations across the continent. At the same time, most voters in Scotland want to remain in Europe and it is possible the movement for Scotland to leave Britain would revive to enable Scotland to remain in Europe while leaving Britain. A triumph for the Leave forces would empower separatist and nativist forces across Europe.  In Britain the major players throughout the business establishment are joining forces with the conservative British Prime Minister and the leader of the British Labour party in support of the Remain forces. Will this strong establishment support persuade the public to remain? Or will it create an anti-establishment backlash that carries the Leave forces to victory?  For the same reason that the trade issue is a potent force advancing the Leave cause in Britain, it is one of the few major areas where Trump and Sanders agree-both oppose the Trans Pacific Partnership trade agreement, which Clinton once supported but now opposes.  In American politics this anti-establishment backlash has fueled the candidacies of both Sanders and Trump throughout the primaries.  On the Democratic side, the question is whether Sanders will re-mobilize his small donors and volunteers on behalf of Clinton and efforts to elect liberals to the House and Senate. In the end he almost certainly will, but the intensity and focus of his efforts will decide how effective he ultimately is.  The more immediate impact of the Brexit vote will be on the Trump campaign. If the Leave group wins the Brexit vote it will give some new impetus to the Trump campaign and anti-establishment forces in the U.S.  Politically what bears watching on the Brexit vote will be the relative turnout of the Leave and Remain forces. If the Leave group wins, that could suggest that Trump will benefit from a higher turnout of anti-establishment voters which would give a boost to his campaign as American media will focus on this point while European media will focus quickly and intensely on other nations with movements similar to Brexit. Markets and politics would both become dramatically more unstable in the face of a Leave victory.  The bottom line in American and European politics is that there is a wave of anxiety and backlash against establishments. Sanders gets it, which accounts for his surge during the primaries in the", "output": "{\"topical_attitudes\": [{\"source\": {\"entity\": \"Donald Trump\", \"references\": [\"Donald Trump\"]}, \"target\": {\"topic\": \"anti-establishment movement\", \"references\": [\"anti-establishment camp\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"Trump and Sanders, who are both clearly aligned with the anti-establishment camp.\"], \"attitude\": \"Positive\"}, {\"source\": {\"entity\": \"Bernie Sanders\", \"references\": [\"Bernie Sanders\"]}, \"target\": {\"topic\": \"anti-establishment movement\", \"references\": [\"anti-establishment camp\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"Trump and Sanders, who are both clearly aligned with the anti-establishment camp.\"], \"attitude\": \"Positive\"}, {\"source\": {\"entity\": \"Hillary Clinton\", \"references\": [\"Hillary Clinton\"]}, \"target\": {\"topic\": \"anti-establishment movement\", \"references\": [\"anti-establishment camp\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"I would add, is fundamentally a bystander in the great divide between populists and establishments.\"], \"attitude\": \"Negative\"}, {\"source\": {\"entity\": \"Donald Trump\", \"references\": [\"Donald Trump\"]}, \"target\": {\"topic\": \"Brexit\", \"references\": [\"Brexit\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"If the Leave group wins the Brexit vote it will give some new impetus to the Trump campaign and anti-establishment forces in the U.S.\"], \"attitude\": \"Positive\"}, {\"source\": {\"entity\": \"Bernie Sanders\", \"references\": [\"Bernie Sanders\"]}, \"target\": {\"topic\": \"Brexit\", \"references\": [\"Brexit\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"On the Democratic side, the question is whether Sanders will re-mobilize his small donors and volunteers on behalf of Clinton and efforts to elect liberals to the House and Senate.\"], \"attitude\": \"Neutral\"}, {\"source\": {\"entity\": \"European Union\", \"references\": [\"European Union\"]}, \"target\": {\"topic\": \"Brexit\", \"references\": [\"Brexit\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"If the Leave group prevails there is a real question whether the European Union could break apart.\"], \"attitude\": \"Negative\"}], \"entity_attitudes\": [{\"entity1\": {\"entity\": \"Donald Trump\", \"references\": [\"Donald Trump\"]}, \"entity2\": {\"entity\": \"Bernie Sanders\", \"references\": [\"Bernie Sanders\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"Trump and Sanders, who are both clearly aligned with the anti-establishment camp.\"], \"attitude\": \"Positive\"}, {\"entity1\": {\"entity\": \"Hillary Clinton\", \"references\": [\"Hillary Clinton\"]}, \"entity2\": {\"entity\": \"Donald Trump\", \"references\": [\"Donald Trump\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"I would add, is fundamentally a bystander in the great divide between populists and establishments, trying to maneuver between the two camps, unlike Trump and Sanders.\"], \"attitude\": \"Negative\"}, {\"entity1\": {\"entity\": \"Hillary Clinton\", \"references\": [\"Hillary Clinton\"]}, \"entity2\": {\"entity\": \"Bernie Sanders\", \"references\": [\"Bernie Sanders\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"I would add, is fundamentally a bystander in the great divide between populists and establishments, trying to maneuver between the two camps, unlike Trump and Sanders.\"], \"attitude\": \"Negative\"}, {\"entity1\": {\"entity\": \"Donald Trump\", \"references\": [\"Donald Trump\"]}, \"entity2\": {\"entity\": \"European Union\", \"references\": [\"European Union\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"If the Leave group prevails there is a real question whether the European Union could break apart.\"], \"attitude\": \"Negative\"}]}"}

Mr. Trump does get it, which accounts for his sweeping march to the Republican nomination. Clinton only partially gets it, and the great potential weakness of her candidacy is the widespread perception that deep down, she is the establishment candidate. I and others have privately and publicly urged Clinton, with limited success so far, to become much more populist and progressive and to become a change candidate, not appear as a status quo candidate running for President Obama's third term.  If the Remain forces prevail the establishments in both Britain and the United States will become ever more complacent, which would be a huge mistake, because the anger and anxiety will remain and find new outlets to unleash the public fury that will not go away until the reasons for it are addressed.  If the Leave forces prevail it will give a lift to Trump, which is not being reported in American media today but will be widely reported in the aftermath of a Leave victory, and to a lesser but real degree it would give a lift to Sanders if he chooses to remain vigorously active in national politics, which he probably will. And the pressure will mount on Clinton to take more forceful positions on issues that drive the anti-establishment voters.  For Europe the stakes are incalculable. If Leave prevails there will be movements across the continent that will be strengthened and determined and there is no guarantee that the European Union will survive.  Europe was battered and bloodied during the First World War and the Second World War. Europe survived the Cold War not only intact but strengthened. Europe is now challenged by immigration and terrorism, by slow growth and economic anxiety, and by political and cultural divisions. If the Leave vote prevails, whatever the merits of the matter, European politics will be gripped by chaos, Russia will be strengthened by the crisis in the European unity, and make no mistake, all hell will break lose across the continent with major repercussions on our side of the Atlantic.

AREA DAD TALKS ABOUT DAUGHTERS, FINANCIAL REGULATION: President Obama knows one place his daughters will not end up working: Wall Street.  In a new interview, Obama laughed off the idea that anyone in his family would end up working in the financial sector. In fact, he suggested that too many talented Americans may be wooed by power and paychecks on Wall Street and could use their abilities elsewhere.  \\\\\\\"If you start getting to the point where 40 percent of the economy is taken up by the financial sector and that our best and brightest are going into financial work as opposed to engineering or computer science, then we could actually lose our competitive edge over time,\\\\\\\" he told Bloomberg Businessweek.  \\\\\\\"I am pretty certain that my daughters will not end up working on Wall Street,\\\\\\\" he said when asked about their future.

GOP DRAWS BATTLE LINE WITH OBAMACARE: Speaker Paul Ryan on Wednesday formally unveiled the House GOP alternative plan for the Affordable Care Act, billing it as the culmination of years of party pledges and effort.  \\\\\\\"For six years now, we have promised to repeal and replace ObamaCare and make healthcare actually affordable,\\\\\\\" the Wisconsin Republican said at an event at the American Enterprise Institute. \\\\\\\"Well, here it is: a real plan - in black and white - right here.\\\\\\\"  The plan envisions a simpler system than ObamaCare with limited financial assistance, lighter regulation and less federal spending on healthcare. It allows for less generous, basic health plans, as opposed to ObamaCare plans, which must cover an array of required elements.  Democrats immediately attacked the plan, saying it is just a broad outline, and one that, if ever implemented, would roll back the coverage gains of ObamaCare.

CONFEDERATE FLAG BAN DROPPED FROM SPENDING BILL: A measure to restrict the display of the Confederate battle flag in national cemeteries approved by the House last month has been pulled from the chamber's final compromise spending bill.  The House passed a spending package along party lines early Thursday morning that includes appropriations for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), as well as emergency funding for combating the Zika virus.  Rep. Jared Huffman's (D-Calif.) amendment, adopted as part of the House's version of the 2017 VA spending bill, would have prohibited the large-scale display of the Confederate battle flag in cemeteries run by the VA, such as flying the banner over mass graves.  It would still have allowed families to still place small flags on individual graves on two days of the year: Memorial Day and Confederate Memorial Day.

Voters in four battleground states - Colorado, Florida, Nevada and Ohio - expressed positive views about the U.S. expanding trade, even while Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump call for major changes to the nation's global commercial outreach.

Yet while these political insurgencies may be separated by an ocean, they are rooted in the same ideological soil. As Trump vows to \\\\\\\"Make America Great Again,\\\\\\\" advocates of a so-called Brexit echo his slogan with their own battle cry: \\\\\\\"Take back our country.\\\\\\\"  That twinned sentiment highlights the parallels between the Trump and Brexit campaigns. Experts say the movements emerge from similar grievances, while their respective remedies aim to rip up existing orders.  \\\\\\\"Both groups are completely disillusioned with the political establishment and the status quo they support,\\\\\\\" said Ian Bremmer, CEO of Eurasia Group, a political risk consulting firm. \\\\\\\"They do not see themselves as benefiting at all from the recent economic rebound. They are generally opposed to globalization and free trade. They are strongly concerned about the changing identity of their respective nations, and oppose immigration accordingly.\\\\\\\"  Similar profile  If the movements' slogans speak to the sense of something lost, that's not by accident. Although hardly uniform in their constituencies, Trump and Brexit supporters are generally older, whiter and, well, maler, than backers of other parties. A Washington Post-ABC poll found that 43 percent of Trump supporters feel that whites are losing out to others, for example.  \\\\\\\"The demographics of Brexit voters are remarkably similar to the demographics of Trump voters, as are their most obviously powerful emotional drivers,\\\\\\\" said Anatole Kaletsky, author of \\\\\\\"Capitalism 4.0\\\\\\\" and co-chairman of Gavekal Research. \\\\\\\"Those are, 'We are unhappy with the way our countries have been run by so-called elites, experts and politicians, and the thing we are most unhappy about is the foreign influence of one kind or another in our native land.'\\\\\\\"  Heather Conley, Europe director of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, puts the fear over immigration at the epicenter of both movements.  The U.K's. refusal to adopt the Schengen Agreement that governs other EU countries allows it to better protect internal borders. But the U.K.'s membership in the EU makes it virtually impossible for the British to fully control their own immigration policy. As a result, many Brexit supporters blame their woes on the influx of immigrants in the U.K. in recent years and on the EU policies that require \\\\\\\"freedom of movement\\\\\\\" among member states.  In the U.S., meanwhile, Trump's statements about Mexicans and Muslims have been denounced in many quarters as racist, including by presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. However, according to a CBS poll, 53 percent of those who back a Muslim ban say it does not conflict with America's founding principles.  These inflammatory statements regarding identity ripple across the Atlantic as well. Opponents of Nigel Farage, a leader of the \\\\\\\"Leave\\\\\\\" camp, have described his campaign as xenophobic and hateful. Meanwhile, board member Arabella Arkwright recently resigned from her position after retweeting anti-Muslim rhetoric on social media  \\\\\\\"If you are afraid of something, and you see immigrants coming in and you feel like you are sharing a smaller piece of the services, or you are not getting access to the services because you see your community is changing right before your eyes, then you want that to stop,\\\\\\\" Conley said. \\\\\\\"And you want to send a", "output": "{\"topical_attitudes\": [{\"source\": {\"topic\": \"Brexit\", \"references\": [\"Brexit\"]}, \"target\": {\"topic\": \"immigration\", \"references\": [\"fear over immigration\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"Heather Conley, Europe director of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, puts the fear over immigration at the epicenter of both movements.\"], \"attitude\": \"Negative\"}, {\"source\": {\"topic\": \"Brexit\", \"references\": [\"Brexit\"]}, \"target\": {\"topic\": \"European Union\", \"references\": [\"EU policies\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"As a result, many Brexit supporters blame their woes on the influx of immigrants in the U.K. in recent years and on the EU policies that require 'freedom of movement' among member states.\"], \"attitude\": \"Negative\"}, {\"source\": {\"topic\": \"Trump campaign\", \"references\": [\"Trump\", \"Trump's statements about Mexicans and Muslims\"]}, \"target\": {\"topic\": \"immigration\", \"references\": [\"immigration\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"In the U.S., meanwhile, Trump's statements about Mexicans and Muslims have been denounced in many quarters as racist.\"], \"attitude\": \"Negative\"}, {\"source\": {\"topic\": \"Brexit\", \"references\": [\"Brexit\"]}, \"target\": {\"topic\": \"globalization\", \"references\": [\"opposed to globalization\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"They are generally opposed to globalization and free trade.\"], \"attitude\": \"Negative\"}, {\"source\": {\"topic\": \"Trump campaign\", \"references\": [\"Trump\"]}, \"target\": {\"topic\": \"globalization\", \"references\": [\"opposed to globalization\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"They are generally opposed to globalization and free trade.\"], \"attitude\": \"Negative\"}], \"entity_attitudes\": [{\"entity1\": {\"entity\": \"Donald Trump\", \"references\": [\"Donald Trump\"]}, \"entity2\": {\"entity\": \"Brexit supporters\", \"references\": [\"Brexit supporters\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"That twinned sentiment highlights the parallels between the Trump and Brexit campaigns.\"], \"attitude\": \"Positive\"}, {\"entity1\": {\"entity\": \"Brexit supporters\", \"references\": [\"Brexit supporters\"]}, \"entity2\": {\"entity\": \"Trump supporters\", \"references\": [\"Trump supporters\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"The demographics of Brexit voters are remarkably similar to the demographics of Trump voters.\"], \"attitude\": \"Positive\"}, {\"entity1\": {\"entity\": \"Trump supporters\", \"references\": [\"Trump supporters\"]}, \"entity2\": {\"entity\": \"Brexit supporters\", \"references\": [\"Brexit voters\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"The demographics of Brexit voters are remarkably similar to the demographics of Trump voters.\"], \"attitude\": \"Positive\"}, {\"entity1\": {\"entity\": \"Nigel Farage\", \"references\": [\"Nigel Farage\"]}, \"entity2\": {\"entity\": \"opponents of Nigel Farage\", \"references\": [\"Opponents of Nigel Farage\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"Opponents of Nigel Farage, a leader of the 'Leave' camp, have described his campaign as xenophobic and hateful.\"], \"attitude\": \"Negative\"}, {\"entity1\": {\"entity\": \"Arabella Arkwright\", \"references\": [\"Arabella Arkwright\"]}, \"entity2\": {\"entity\": \"anti-Muslim rhetoric\", \"references\": [\"anti-Muslim rhetoric\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"Meanwhile, board member Arabella Arkwright recently resigned from her position after retweeting anti-Muslim rhetoric on social media.\"], \"attitude\": \"Negative\"}, {\"entity1\": {\"entity\": \"Hillary Clinton\", \"references\": [\"Hillary Clinton\"]}, \"entity2\": {\"entity\": \"Trump\", \"references\": [\"Trump\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"Trump's statements about Mexicans and Muslims have been denounced in many quarters as racist, including by presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.\"], \"attitude\": \"Negative\"}]}"}

The co-founder of a communications agency, Herz is among thousands of French Jews who moved across the channel in recent years. He says he immigrated mostly for financial reasons and is enjoying the added benefit of having his teenage children study in English in a good school.  Herz, his wife and three kids are part of the vibrant congregation of the Liberal Jewish Synagogue, which recently added services in French led by a rabbi from Strasbourg. The school and the synagogue, he added, are the pillars of his social life in his adoptive country.  But like millions living in Britain, the Herzes are now unsure of their future on the island kingdom as it prepares to vote on a referendum on staying in or leaving the European Union - a decision that could have far-reaching consequences for Europeans living and working in England, and for British workers on the continent.  \\\\\\\"We are in limbo,\\\\\\\" Herz, 45, told JTA last month. \\\\\\\"No one, including the government, seems to know what it would mean for us if Britain leaves.\\\\\\\"  The June 23 vote on whether to \\\\\\\"Brexit\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\"Bremain\\\\\\\" follows December's vote in Parliament to put the decision to a referendum.  Occurring amid a debate over the EU's authority over individual member states and their financial affairs, the Brexit issue is further complicated by growing tensions among lawmakers over foreign policy issues, including Turkey's strained relationship with the EU and the migrant crisis.  As in elsewhere in Europe, Britain's right-wing parties resent U.K. membership in the bloc. They say a Brexit would ensure Britain is not pressured into taking in some of the 1.8 million mostly Muslim migrants who entered Europe last year.  But Bremainers - including Prime Minister David Cameron, who agreed to a referendum to appease his Conservative Party's right-leaning bloc - warn it would disrupt Britain's economy and force millions of Britons living on the continent to return. The scenario triggered speculation that Britain might retaliate by sending millions of EU citizens living in the U.K. packing.  Despite Cameron's campaign against the Brexit - U.S. President Barack Obama controversially endorsed his position in a joint news conference last month with the British premier - polls suggest a 50-50 split.  READ: WITHDRAWING FROM EU WOULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT ISRAEL, CAMERON SAYS  Surveys remained too close to call even after the murder of Jo Cox, a Labour lawmaker and mother of two who had campaigned against Brexit, by an alleged far-right extremist. Still, some commentators insist that the June 16 stabbing near Leeds in northern England may hurt the Brexit camp, causing voters to veer left.  British Jews are divided on the issue, according to Justin Cohen, news editor at London's Jewish News daily. But among Europeans living in Britain, including French-speaking Jews, Brexit is seen as a disruptive choice born out of fear and arrogance.  \\\\\\\"In France, we see fear taking the form of xenophobia, as a rising National Front party reaches new popularity,\\\\\\\" said the Herzes' rabbi, Rene Pfertzel, who came to Britain 15 years ago to study and ended up staying. \\\\\\\"In Britain, it assumes the form of Brexit isolationism. But it comes from the same source.\\\\\\\"  For French Jews, Britain is attractive because it has lower taxes than France, more employment opportunities and a large Jewish community of some 250,000 people - Western Europe's largest after France's own 500,000 Jews.

Under EU agreements, citizens of member states may relocate and work in any of the bloc's 28 member states without requiring permission, often simply by registering as residents with their EU passport with the local municipality. For Europeans, a Brexit is expected to mean some sort of application process for residence in the U.K., possibly involving a vetting process by British immigration authorities.  The ability to escape anti-Semitism is among the arguments for remaining in a union that allows individuals greater freedom to move among member states.  Some Jews feel safer in Britain than in France, although anti-Semitism here remains a problem. In 2013, 69 violent anti-Semitic attacks were recorded in Britain compared to 105 in France, meaning Jews were 1.3 times likelier to be physically assaulted in Britain. In some other years, French Jews were likelier to be attacked, though not by much.  \\\\\\\"The risks are the same risks, guards are sadly necessary in synagogues here and in France,\\\\\\\" said Sacha Bielawski, a 38-year-old father of two who came to London 10 years ago from Paris and works in finance. \\\\\\\"I feel equally safe and unsafe in both countries.\\\\\\\"  Linda Borowski, a computer specialist from Brussels who moved to London 10 years ago, says she is now in the process of immigrating to the United States because of the threat of jihadism.  \\\\\\\"My children are targets here every bit as much as in Brussels,\\\\\\\" she said. \\\\\\\"I do not want to raise them in fear or under guard.\\\\\\\"  Herz said the British media was playing up the risk to Jews in France and portraying Britain as a refuge in what he called \\\\\\\"French bashing.\\\\\\\" Jewish immigration to London \\\\\\\"is part of a major wave of general emigration from France\\\\\\\" and is not specific to Jews, he said.  Whatever the reason, the recent arrival of hundreds of French Jews to Britain led to the establishment of Francophone Jewish communities in three London synagogues and the formation of predominantly French-speaking classrooms in at least one Jewish London school.  Many of the French Jews of London have little to fear even in the event of Brexit, said Bielawski.  \\\\\\\"A realistic solution will be found to the visa issue,\\\\\\\" he said. \\\\\\\"The London finance industry and market is full of foreigners; they will have to be reasonable if they want to avoid a collapse.\\\\\\\"  But newcomers like the Herzes are less certain than longtime residents, who have accumulated various rights over time, including to vote in some local elections and referendums. In the Brexit referendum, however, only British, Irish and Commonwealth citizens who live in the U.K. may vote.  British Jews are far more divided on the issue than the French Jews among them.  Robert Halfon, a British-Jewish lawmaker, argued in a March op-ed in the Jewish News that remaining would allow London to positively influence EU policy on Israel.

{"instruction": "Extract attitudes between entities and topics from the article in JSON format and categorize them [Positive, Neutral, Negative] and justify them quoting the article", "input": "The UK voters did it: Britain is now out of the European Union.  The debate has been messy over whether Britain should exit the EU, a move nicknamed Brexit. In part that's because of all the unknown outcomes -- each side has had a tough time building a solid case.  Those wanting to leave are justifying their position with arguments about British sovereignty, the amount of money the UK sends to the EU, and uncontrolled immigration. Some who are voting to remain are doing so because their ties to Europe run deep, others because they want to avoid another recession. Some just do not want to make what would likely be an irreversible decision about the future of the country in a climate of such uncertainty. Regardless, the remain camp has the clout of the world's leading economists behind it.  It's an historic moment: No country has ever left the EU. That makes it impossible to say for sure what will happen now that Brexit is a reality. The ambiguity extends to the effects a leave vote would have on the technology industry, which has generally leaned toward Britain remaining in Europe.  Here's a look at the potential implications.  What has the EU ever done for tech?  British citizens have reason to be grateful to the EU, which prioritized broadband in every home, passed data-protection regulations and recognized the needs for countries to work together on cybersecurity issues.  The EU is working toward a digital single market, a seamless online marketplace where digital services can prosper and where industry, employment and the economy all benefit from digitalisation. Issues tackled so far include ensuring people have equal access to Netflix.  The Union is also currently in the process of making sure phone users can enjoy movement from member state to member state without having to pay roaming fees. Such policies have proved popular not just with consumers; all the UK's network operators believe EU membership is good for their businesses, and they are firmly on the side of remaining in the EU.  \\\\\\\"Britain needs unrestricted access to the European market in order to compete effectively,\\\\\\\" Telefonica CEO Ronan Dunne wrote in a blog post on LinkedIn in May. \\\\\\\"Without this, we risk serious harm to our economy in the short, medium and long term.\\\\\\\"  BT, which earns about a fifth of its revenue outside the UK, said it values the way EU membership opens markets. \\\\\\\"The board and senior management of BT have been clear for months that the company's prospects are better if the UK stays in a reformed EU,\\\\\\\" a BT spokesperson said.  The British tech-industry vote  The networks are not alone.  A survey of the UK's tech workers by Juniper Research has found that 65 percent think Brexit will have a negative impact on the global tech industry. Seven in ten of those who predict a negative outcome for tech also believe it would be harder for UK tech firms to attract and employ individuals from EU countries.  The UK leads Europe's tech sector, with the country boasting 18 of the EU's 47 private tech companies valued at more than $1 billion, which are also known as unicorns. Nearly two-thirds of respondents to Juniper's survey said they think the tech industry would suffer as a result of reduced funding from the EU for the UK tech sector and that London would be less attractive as a tech hub.  A report published by The Guardian in May showed that many UK unicorns are robustly in favour of EU membership.

That's how Ireland is viewing today's referendum on the British membership in the European Union, a divisive debate where polls have shown citizens vacillating between \\\\\\\"Leave\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"Remain\\\\\\\" in the days leading up to the decisive vote.  From an economic perspective, Ireland would very much like the United Kingdom to remain in the bloc, citing the uncertainty that would follow a \\\\\\\"Brexit,\\\\\\\" as the abandonment of the status quo has been called.  \\\\\\\"They are our largest trading partner, and we are unequivocal in our view that it would be better for everybody, including the Irish, if the United Kingdom stays within the EU,\\\\\\\" said Emmanuel Dowdall, head of IDA Ireland for North America, who fears a two-year period of uncertainty that would follow if Britain has to negotiate the terms of its EU breakup. In terms of trade deals, the U.K. would have to start from scratch, and what's hammered out with the EU as a whole would affect all its individual European trading relationships.  Brexit could have a potential downward impact on the British pound, hurt bilateral trade with Ireland and engender ambiguous implications for the credibility of the EU, he said.  \\\\\\\"I think it validates the strength and the aspirations of the European Union in a way that would be far better if they stayed,\\\\\\\" he said.  That said, the EU's only other English-speaking country (and already the only one in the euro area) realizes that many multinational corporate headquarters would be up for grabs, given that that many want one base for the entire 28-member bloc.  \\\\\\\"We are already having a very good level of success in terms of (foreign direct investment), but I do think that in the short term you will see some increased activity, particularly in the financial services environment,\\\\\\\" Mr. Dowdall said in an interview in late May in Atlanta, where he previously worked and maintains a home. \\\\\\\"From that perspective, Ireland is already hearing from companies that are doing a range of scenario planning.\\\\\\\"  Ireland knows a thing or two about how investors value predictability when making major decisions.  The country underwent a major financial crisis caused by a property bust in 2009 but had the discipline to implement austerity measures that have reined in debt without touching the sacrosanct corporate tax rate of 12.5 percent. That has been a major arrow in Ireland's recruitment quiver.  \\\\\\\"Ireland was able to restructure and re-profile itself to international investors,\\\\\\\" Mr. Dowdall said.  In 2015, FDI surged to record levels, and more importantly for a country that has embarked on a job creation plan, the levels of employment by foreign investors also swelled. The economy overall grew by more than 7 percent last year.  About 180,000 jobs in Ireland, a country of 4 million people, are directly supported by foreign investment, 137,000 of them by companies from the United States. Multiplied out by broader economic impacts of those infusions, Invest Ireland calculates that nearly 20 percent of the total private-sector labor force can be traced back to investment from overseas.", "output": "{\"topical_attitudes\": [{\"source\": {\"entity\": \"Ireland\", \"references\": [\"Ireland\"]}, \"target\": {\"topic\": \"Brexit\", \"references\": [\"Brexit\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"Ireland would very much like the United Kingdom to remain in the bloc\", \"Brexit could have a potential downward impact on the British pound, hurt bilateral trade with Ireland and engender ambiguous implications for the credibility of the EU\"], \"attitude\": \"Negative\"}, {\"source\": {\"entity\": \"Ireland\", \"references\": [\"Ireland\"]}, \"target\": {\"topic\": \"European Union membership\", \"references\": [\"European Union\", \"EU\", \"status quo\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"Ireland would very much like the United Kingdom to remain in the bloc\", \"it would be better for everybody, including the Irish, if the United Kingdom stays within the EU\"], \"attitude\": \"Positive\"}, {\"source\": {\"entity\": \"Ireland\", \"references\": [\"Ireland\"]}, \"target\": {\"topic\": \"foreign direct investment\", \"references\": [\"foreign direct investment\", \"FDI\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"Ireland is already hearing from companies that are doing a range of scenario planning\", \"FDI surged to record levels in 2015\", \"about 180,000 jobs in Ireland... are directly supported by foreign investment\"], \"attitude\": \"Positive\"}, {\"source\": {\"entity\": \"Ireland\", \"references\": [\"Ireland\"]}, \"target\": {\"topic\": \"financial crisis\", \"references\": [\"financial crisis\", \"property bust in 2009\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"The country underwent a major financial crisis caused by a property bust in 2009 but had the discipline to implement austerity measures that have reined in debt without touching the sacrosanct corporate tax rate of 12.5 percent\"], \"attitude\": \"Negative\"}], \"entity_attitudes\": [{\"entity1\": {\"entity\": \"Ireland\", \"references\": [\"Ireland\"]}, \"entity2\": {\"entity\": \"United Kingdom\", \"references\": [\"United Kingdom\", \"U.K.\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"Ireland would very much like the United Kingdom to remain in the bloc\", \"it would be better for everybody, including the Irish, if the United Kingdom stays within the EU\"], \"attitude\": \"Positive\"}, {\"entity1\": {\"entity\": \"Emmanuel Dowdall\", \"references\": [\"Emmanuel Dowdall\"]}, \"entity2\": {\"entity\": \"United Kingdom\", \"references\": [\"United Kingdom\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"fears a two-year period of uncertainty that would follow if Britain has to negotiate the terms of its EU breakup\"], \"attitude\": \"Negative\"}, {\"entity1\": {\"entity\": \"Emmanuel Dowdall\", \"references\": [\"Emmanuel Dowdall\"]}, \"entity2\": {\"entity\": \"European Union\", \"references\": [\"European Union\", \"EU\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"I think it validates the strength and the aspirations of the European Union in a way that would be far better if they stayed\"], \"attitude\": \"Positive\"}, {\"entity1\": {\"entity\": \"Emmanuel Dowdall\", \"references\": [\"Emmanuel Dowdall\"]}, \"entity2\": {\"entity\": \"Ireland\", \"references\": [\"Ireland\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"Ireland is already hearing from companies that are doing a range of scenario planning\", \"Ireland knows a thing or two about how investors value predictability when making major decisions\"], \"attitude\": \"Positive\"}, {\"entity1\": {\"entity\": \"Ireland\", \"references\": [\"Ireland\"]}, \"entity2\": {\"entity\": \"European Union\", \"references\": [\"European Union\", \"EU\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"Ireland would very much like the United Kingdom to remain in the bloc\", \"it would be better for everybody, including the Irish, if the United Kingdom stays within the EU\"], \"attitude\": \"Positive\"}]}"}
{"instruction": "Extract attitudes between entities and topics from the article in JSON format and categorize them [Positive, Neutral, Negative] and justify them quoting the article", "input": "If Britain votes Thursday to split from the European Union, the impact of so-called Brexit is likely to reverberate across the Atlantic. Here are three ways a British departure from the EU could affect Americans.  1. Real estate prices could rise. Brexit-related uncertainty in markets in London, one of the top destinations for foreign investors in real estate, could push these investors to consider parking their money in other cities, like New York, Washington, Miami and Los Angeles.  That shift began even before talk of a Brexit had started, according to Edward Mermelstein, a New York real estate attorney. The possibility that the U.K. might abandon the European Union has exacerbated the trend.  \\\\\\\"The implication of Brexit taking place is that it is looking good for the U.S. market,\\\\\\\" Mermelstein said.  The average price of a house bought by a foreign investor from April 2014 to March 2015 in the U.S. was $500,000, nearly twice the average home price of $256,000, according to the National Association of Realtors.  The flip side, of course, of a Brexit bolstering U.S. real estate markets, is that U.S. buyers could face stiffer competition if they are vying against foreign investors for the same property.  2. Companies in a variety of sectors would feel the burden of a Brexit, in the short or the long term - or both - that might be reflected in slumping revenues, stock prices and corporate earnings.  U.S. companies have invested $558 billion in the U.K., the Financial Times has reported. Meanwhile, 88 percent of companies in a recent survey by BritishAmerican Business said its access to the EU's single market boosted the business appeal of the U.K.  \\\\\\\"Brexit would lead to a global fall in equity prices,\\\\\\\" wrote Aaron Klein and DJ Nordquist in an opinion paper for the Brookings Institution, the independent think tank. It \\\\\\\"could spell the first falling domino of European Union disintegration,\\\\\\\" as a vote \\\\\\\"would only be the first step\\\\\\\" in a U.K. departure from the EU.  The sectors most affected, based on revenue exposure to the U.K., are energy, information technology and materials, which have respective exposures at 6.4 percent, 4 percent and 3.7 percent, according to research firm Factset.  Companies with some of the highest sales exposure to the U.K. include eBay, Ford and Xerox, CNBC has reported.  Companies in the Standard & Poor's 500 draw 2.9 percent of their revenue from the United Kingdom. For Newmont Mining of Colorado, for instance, it's 64 percent.  For Brooklyn Brewery in New York, 8 percent of sales come from the U.K. \\\\\\\"Everything going on with this Brexit vote is concerning to us, that it might destabilize the country, affect currencies, change the trading relationship with the rest of the continent,\\\\\\\" CEO Eric Ottaway told International Business Times.  Roger Perlmutter, the head of research and development at Merck, a pharmaceutical company headquartered in New Jersey, has warned if the U.K. withdraws from the EU, its scientists in Britain might struggle as they had benefited from EU grants. In January, the European Investment Fund put 24.8 million British pounds toward the commercialization of scientific inventions, including new medicines.  Other leaders in the pharmaceutical industry have voiced concerns a Brexit would lead to trade risks and new regulations that could ratchet up costs for companies that are used to operate in a 28-country zone with synchronized rules on intellectual property, quality standards and other important criteria.  Converting earnings in British pounds to dollars could also cost companies,", "output": "\"{\\n  \\\"topical_attitudes\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"source\\\": { \\\"topic\\\": \\\"Brexit\\\", \\\"references\\\": [\\\"Brexit\\\"] },\\n      \\\"target\\\": { \\\"topic\\\": \\\"U.S. real estate market\\\", \\\"references\\\": [\\\"U.S. market\\\"] },\\n      \\\"justifications\\\": [\\\"The implication of Brexit taking place is that it is looking good for the U.S. market.\\\"]\\n      \\\"attitude\\\": \\\"Positive\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"source\\\": { \\\"topic\\\": \\\"Brexit\\\", \\\"references\\\": [\\\"Brexit\\\"] },\\n      \\\"target\\\": { \\\"topic\\\": \\\"U.S. companies\\\", \\\"references\\\": [\\\"Companies in a variety of sectors\\\"] },\\n      \\\"justifications\\\": [\\\"Companies in a variety of sectors would feel the burden of a Brexit, in the short or the long term - or both - that might be reflected in slumping revenues, stock prices and corporate earnings.\\\"]\\n      \\\"attitude\\\": \\\"Negative\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"source\\\": { \\\"topic\\\": \\\"Brexit\\\", \\\"references\\\": [\\\"Brexit\\\"] },\\n      \\\"target\\\": { \\\"topic\\\": \\\"currency and trade risks\\\", \\\"references\\\": [\\\"might destabilize the country, affect currencies, change the trading relationship with the rest of the continent\\\"] },\\n      \\\"justifications\\\": [\\\"Everything going on with this Brexit vote is concerning to us, that it might destabilize the country, affect currencies, change the trading relationship with the rest of the continent.\\\"]\\n      \\\"attitude\\\": \\\"Negative\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"source\\\": { \\\"topic\\\": \\\"Brexit\\\", \\\"references\\\": [\\\"Brexit\\\"] },\\n      \\\"target\\\": { \\\"topic\\\": \\\"European Investment Fund\\\", \\\"references\\\": [\\\"European Investment Fund\\\"] },\\n      \\\"justifications\\\": [\\\"The European Investment Fund put 24.8 million British pounds toward the commercialization of scientific inventions, including new medicines.\\\"]\\n      \\\"attitude\\\": \\\"Negative\\\"\\n    }\\n  ],\\n  \\\"entity_attitudes\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"entity1\\\": { \\\"entity\\\": \\\"Edward Mermelstein\\\", \\\"references\\\": [\\\"Edward Mermelstein\\\"] },\\n      \\\"entity2\\\": { \\\"entity\\\": \\\"Brexit\\\", \\\"references\\\": [\\\"Brexit\\\"] },\\n      \\\"justifications\\\": [\\\"The possibility that the U.K. might abandon the European Union has exacerbated the trend.\\\"]\\n      \\\"attitude\\\": \\\"Negative\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"entity1\\\": { \\\"entity\\\": \\\"Aaron Klein\\\", \\\"references\\\": [\\\"Aaron Klein\\\"] },\\n      \\\"entity2\\\": { \\\"entity\\\": \\\"Brexit\\\", \\\"references\\\": [\\\"Brexit\\\"] },\\n      \\\"justifications\\\": [\\\"Brexit would lead to a global fall in equity prices.\\\"]\\n      \\\"attitude\\\": \\\"Negative\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"entity1\\\": { \\\"entity\\\": \\\"DJ Nordquist\\\", \\\"references\\\": [\\\"DJ Nordquist\\\"] },\\n      \\\"entity2\\\": { \\\"entity\\\": \\\"Brexit\\\", \\\"references\\\": [\\\"Brexit\\\"] },\\n      \\\"justifications\\\": [\\\"Brexit would lead to a global fall in equity prices.\\\"]\\n      \\\"attitude\\\": \\\"Negative\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"entity1\\\": { \\\"entity\\\": \\\"Eric Ottaway\\\", \\\"references\\\": [\\\"Eric Ottaway\\\"] },\\n      \\\"entity2\\\": { \\\"entity\\\": \\\"Brexit\\\", \\\"references\\\": [\\\"Brexit\\\"] },\\n      \\\"justifications\\\": [\\\"Everything going on with this Brexit vote is concerning to us, that it might destabilize the country, affect currencies, change the trading relationship with the rest of the continent.\\\"]\\n      \\\"attitude\\\": \\\"Negative\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"entity1\\\": { \\\"entity\\\": \\\"Roger Perlmutter\\\", \\\"references\\\": [\\\"Roger Perlmutter\\\"] },\\n      \\\"entity2\\\": { \\\"entity\\\": \\\"Brexit\\\", \\\"references\\\": [\\\"Brexit\\\"] },\\n      \\\"justifications\\\": [\\\"Roger Perlmutter, the head of research and development at Merck, a pharmaceutical company headquartered in New Jersey, has warned if the U.K. withdraws from the EU, its scientists in Britain might struggle as they had benefited from EU grants.\\\"]\\n      \\\"attitude\\\": \\\"Negative\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"entity1\\\": { \\\"entity\\\": \\\"Merck\\\", \\\"references\\\": [\\\"Merck\\\"] },\\n      \\\"entity2\\\": { \\\"entity\\\": \\\"Brexit\\\", \\\"references\\\": [\\\"Brexit\\\"] },\\n      \\\"justifications\\\": [\\\"Roger Perlmutter, the head of research and development at Merck, a pharmaceutical company headquartered in New Jersey, has warned if the U.K. withdraws from the EU, its scientists in Britain might struggle as they had benefited from EU grants.\\\"]\\n      \\\"attitude\\\": \\\"Negative\\\"\\n    }\\n  ]\\n}\""}

Photograph by Chris Ratcliffe / Bloomberg via Getty  If things go as expected on Thursday, British voters will reject the option of leaving the European Union. Likewise, if things go as expected come November, American voters will reject the option of electing a President Trump. Both outcomes would be reassuring, but they would not mean the end of right-wing populism on either side of the Atlantic-they may merely represent new high-water marks.  When the Brexit referendum is done, tens of millions of Britons will likely have registered a vote against the liberal vision of European unity and assimilation. In this country, even after the disastrous past few weeks Donald Trump has had, a new opinion poll, from Quinnipiac University, indicates that in crucial states like Ohio and Pennsylvania he remains statistically tied with Hillary Clinton.  Why is this happening? Trump and his counterpart in Britain, the U.K. Independence Party (UKIP) leader Nigel Farage, did not emerge from nowhere. Both are wealthy men who affect an affinity with the common people, and who have skillfully exploited a deep well of resentment among working-class and middle-class voters, some of whom have traditionally supported left-of-center parties. Certainly, a parallel factor in both men's rise is racism, or, more specifically, nativism. Trump has presented a nightmarish vision of America overrun by Mexican felons and Muslim terrorists. UKIP printed up campaign posters that showed thousands of dark-colored refugees lining up to enter Slovenia, which is part of the E.U., next to the words \\\\\\\"BREAKING POINT: The EU has failed us all.\\\\\\\" But racism and nationalism have both been around for a long time, as have demagogues who try to exploit them. In healthy democracies, these troublemakers are confined to the fringes.  Historically, transforming radical parties of the right (or left) into mass movements has required some sort of disaster, such as a major war or an economic depression. Europe in the early twentieth century witnessed both, with cataclysmic results. After the First World War, the introduction of social democracy, the socioeconomic system that most Western countries settled on, delivered steadily rising living standards, which helped to keep the extremists at bay. If prosperity wasn't shared equally-and it wasn't-egalitarian social norms and redistributive tax systems blunted some of the inequities that go along with free-market capitalism.  But in the past few decades Western countries have been subjected to a triad of forces that, while not as visible or dramatic as wars and depressions, have proved equally destabilizing: globalization, technical progress, and a political philosophy that embraces both. In the United States, it is no coincidence that Trump is doing well in the Rust Belt and other deindustrialized areas. A one-two punch of automation and offshoring has battered these regions, leaving many of their residents ill-equipped to prosper in today's economy. Trump is exploiting the same economic anxieties and resentments that helped Bernie Sanders, another critic of globalization and free trade, carry the Michigan Democratic primary.  \\\\\\\"There is no excuse for supporting a racist, sexist, xenophobic buffoon like Donald Trump,\\\\\\\" Dean Baker, an economist and blogger at the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research, in Washington, noted recently. \\\\\\\"But we should be clear; the workers who turn to him do have real", "output": "{\"topical_attitudes\": [{\"source\": {\"entity\": \"Nigel Farage\", \"references\": [\"Nigel Farage\"]}, \"target\": {\"topic\": \"Brexit referendum\", \"references\": [\"leave the European Union\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"an option supported by Nigel Farage, the leader of the U.K. Independence Party.\"], \"attitude\": \"Positive\"}, {\"source\": {\"entity\": \"Donald Trump\", \"references\": [\"Donald Trump\"]}, \"target\": {\"topic\": \"right-wing populism\", \"references\": [\"right-wing populism\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"new high-water marks.

After months of bitter campaigning that sharply divided the country over questions of immigration and identity, election day dawned with a cliffhanger. Among the five polls released on the eve of the vote, two showed a lead for \\\\\\\"in,\\\\\\\" two gave the edge to \\\\\\\"out\\\\\\\" and one forecast a tie. The final average of all polls was 50-50, with Britons evenly split over whether the country should exit the 28-member European Union.

Voting takes place throughout the day on Thursday, and the results are expected early Friday (Thursday evening Eastern time). The referendum marks an existential decision that could dramatically reshape Britain's global role in a way not seen since London shed its empire after World War II. It could also lead to another push on Scottish secession, the further unraveling of the European Union and the fall of Prime Minister David Cameron's government. As the first votes were cast - with the often-variable British weather running the gamut from a torrential downpour in London to sunny, clear skies in Scotland - anxiety was the prevailing mood. (\\\\u2026) Advocates for a British exit - popularly known as Brexit - argue that tossing off the shackles of E.U. bureaucracy will restore Britain's sovereignty. A powerful selling point for many votes is the claim that a farewell to E.U. ties could give the country the latitude to dramatically reduce immigration, which has hit record highs as Poles, Hungarians, Romanians and others from across Europe have flocked to the relative prosperity of the British economy. \\\\\\\"I really think tomorrow can be independence day,\\\\\\\" former London mayor Boris Johnson told supporters Wednesday as he posed for photos with fishmongers and waved copies of the virulently anti-E.U. Sun newspaper. Pro-Brexit leaders used the hashtag #IndependenceDay on Twitter Thursday morning to exhort their followers to get out and vote for what they promise will be a liberation from Brussels bureaucrats. But opponents say a vote to leave could be a grievous \\\\u00adself-inflicted wound from which it would take years, if not decades, for Britain to recover. \\\\\\\"We do not solve our immigration challenge by leaving the European Union, but we do create a massive problem for our economy,\\\\\\\" Cameron told the BBC on the eve of the vote. \\\\\\\"This is irreversible.

Economic forecasters have said a British break could push the country back into recession, with the rest of the globe vulnerable to the ripples. Many geopolitical strategists also warn that a vote to leave could divide the Western alliance and be a boon to others such as Russian President Vladimir Putin. But many of the 46 million Britons eligible to vote have paid little heed, with surveys showing that anxiety over immigration is trumping all other voter concerns. The \\\\\\\"leave\\\\\\\" campaign has played on those fears, arguing - with little supporting evidence - that Turkey will soon join the European Union and intensify the flood of migrant workers arriving on British shores under the bloc's free-movement rules. It has also dismissed warnings from independent experts as part of an elitist plot, what it terms \\\\\\\"Project Fear.\\\\\\\" Two of the top Brexit campaigners - Johnson and Justice Secretary Michael Gove - have invoked provocative Nazi comparisons. Johnson has suggested that E.U. ambitions mirror those of Hitler's Germany, and Gove has painted Brexit critics as akin to Nazi propagandists who sought to discredit Albert Einstein. The \\\\\\\"remain\\\\\\\" side has returned fire in recent days. (\\\\u2026) Whichever side wins Thursday will have to reckon with the profound and emotional schisms in British society that have come to the surface during the campaign. When Cameron promised a referendum in January 2013, he had hoped the vote would put to rest a debate over Europe that has bedeviled Britain for decades and that has generated particularly deep fault lines in his Conservative Party. Instead, the campaign appears only to have made those divisions worse, while also layering the debate with the added complexity of personal ambition. Several prominent campaigners - especially Johnson - are thought to be jockeying for Cameron's job if the country defies the prime minister and votes for an exit. Even if \\\\\\\"remain\\\\\\\" wins, Britain's angst is unlikely to be resolved. Some \\\\\\\"leave\\\\\\\" campaigners have said they will press for another referendum if they come up short in a close vote. Thursday's vote also has the potential to reawaken another fundamental question of British identity. Scottish leaders say that if Britain votes to leave the European Union against the will of the pro-European Scots, they will renew their push for independence just two years after losing a referendum vote. The outcome will be watched closely in capitals around the globe. President Obama has weighed in strongly for the \\\\\\\"remain\\\\\\\" side, saying he thinks Britain is a more valuable ally from within the European Union. All of Britain's E.U. allies have said they, too, want Britain to stay. To illustrate the point, European landmarks from Paris to Warsaw have been bathed in the colors of the Union Jack this week, along with the message \\\\\\\"Vote Remain.\\\\\\\" In an op-ed in Britain's Guardian newspaper Wednesday morning, Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi wrote that a vote to leave would be \\\\\\\"the wrong choice.\\\\\\\"  As things stand, the battle between the 'Remain' and 'Leave' forces remains far to close to call and it could be well into Friday morning London time before we have any idea what the outcome might be, especially given the fact that authorities are expecting record-breaking turnout across the U.K. The Poll of Polls, roughly equivalent to the polling averages of polls in the United States kept by RealClearPolitics and and Pollster, has 'Remain' with 51% of the vote to 49% for 'Leave, a number that indicates that the outcome could go either way.

Since then, though, there have been several developments that may have had an impact on the contest. The most noteworthy and tragic, of course, was the cold-blooded assassination of Jo Cox, a Labour MP from Northern England who was outspokenly in favor of 'Remain' and playing a prominent in the campaign alongside her husband, a murder which clearly seems to have been influenced at least in part by the ongoing Brexit debate and the nationalism of the British far-right. When considering these polls, of course, it's worth keeping in mind that it was just a year ago that pre-election polling was pointing toward a tight outcome in the General Election and the possibility that neither David Cameron's Conservative Party nor the Labour Party would end up with enough power in Parliament to form a government. The outcome, as we know, turned out to be quite different in no small part because pollsters appeared to significantly underestimate the turnout for Conservatives across England and the extent to which Scottish voters would punish Labour in favor of the Scottish National Party. The pollsters in Britain say that they have acted to fix the flaws that made last year's errors possible, but we will not know for sure until we see the results of the referendum. It's worth keeping in mind, though, that it's entirely possible that the Brexit polls are similarly flawed and that the outcome will be decisively more in favor of one side or the other.  No matter which side wins or loses today this is unlikely to be the end of the debate about Europe in the United Kingdom, or in other parts of Europe for that matter. The issues created by bureaucrats in Brussels making rules that purport to bind a continent of 300 million people have been a part of European politics beyond Great Britain for some time now, and that's going to continue whether the British people vote to leave or stay. Additionally, if the polls are correct that the outcome of today's vote will be close then the Euroskeptics that have long been a part of post-war British politics will be wounded, but hardly defeated and they are merely likely to lick their wounds and wait to fight another day. Meanwhile, the long-term problems facing the European Union, ranging from fiscal issues to the problem of what to do with the tens of thousands of refugees arriving from Syria and Libya will remain. A vote to leave, meanwhile, will only be the beginning of the process since it is not considered legally binding and it will be up to this and future governments to negotiate and deal with the terms of any such break with Europe, a process that raise complicated issues regarding trade relations, financial issues, and other matters that will not be resolved easily or quickly. Additionally, a 'leave' vote is likely to revive pressures inside the United Kingdom for greater autonomy from Scotland, and perhaps from Northern Ireland as well. In other words, today's vote will be historic and its outcome important, but it's hardly the end of the debates about the future of Europe as a whole and the United Kingdom in particular that have become a central focus of British politics in recent years.

Trump and Brexit 'It's not just Donald Trump. There is a global phenomenon going on and it ties up with all sorts of things going on in the world.' Credit: AP A few months ago I began to realise that what's at the heart of Trump's rise \\\\\\\"Make America great again\\\\\\\" and the Brexit push to \\\\\\\"take back control\\\\\\\" is essentially latent anti-globalisation movements. When I was a kid, globalisation was rarely talked about in any negative sense - the world was our oyster, we would all travel freely, communicate immediately and trade openly.  But the reality for many, particularly the demographics most attracted to Brexit and Trump, has been the widespread elimination of domestic manufacturing industries, uncertainty about the jobs of today and the future, and the realisation that not all players are equal on the great field that is the globe. If you are interested in this, there are some really great pieces (paywalled, I am afraid) in the Financial Times here and the Times here. Donald Trump explicitly stated this in his just-delivered speech when he said: \\\\\\\"Our country lost its way when we stopped putting the American people first. We got here because we switched from a policy of Americanism - focusing on what's good for America's middle class - to a policy of globalism.\\\\\\\" Full transcript here.

The EU used to be held up as a model as we in Asia watched it expand from six nations to 10, then 12 and eventually 28 member states. With the exception of Greenland, which opted out as a Danish colony three decades ago but remains subject to EU treaties, no one had ever thought of quitting the union.  South-east Asian integration, which started in 1967, began with five nations grouped as Asean. This became six when Brunei joined in 1984 and has now grown to 10 members. South Asia, meanwhile, tried its own version, Saarc, albeit with less success. Now, the EU does not look so much like a winner anymore. We have been made aware that there is no sure bet about the integration process being one-way.  How did Britain come to this pass? As long as it suited its purpose of ensuring that there was no concentration of power in Europe, say a Franco-German one, Britain went along with the widening of EU membership.

The sauce that was good for the British goose wasn't good for the British gander.  There is a lesson here. As long as globalisation is about selling goods and products, no one complains too much, provided trade does not favour one party overwhelmingly. But once countries began to push for trade in services and free movement of labour, unease sets in. And Britain is a net importer of goods and a net exporter of services.  What the Brexit debate and vote has shown us is that we can never wish away primeval fears such as fear of being \\\\\\\"swamped by the other\\\\\\\". When you combine these with economic realities such as stagnant wages and fears of reduced social welfare, you get an incendiary mix.  The exact pace of globalisation is hard to map, but Bulgarians, Romanians, Mexicans and, not to forget, Pakistanis and Indians, are easy to identify as villains of the show.  To an extent, perhaps we in South-east Asia may have already tacitly acknowledged this reality - that some things just cannot be rushed. See how the language on an Asean Economic Community has changed.  Not too long ago, the pitch was about developing a single market and production base. These days, we seem happier with less-ambitious formulations such as striving for a \\\\\\\"highly integrated economy\\\\\\\".  One lesson for Asia is how politics let loose can be the bane of social integration, with the potential to harm social compacts built up over decades. Last week, Singapore's Home Affairs and Law Minister K. Shanmugam took note of the anti-Muslim rhetoric in some Western nations arising from this. \\\\\\\"In a multiracial country, there is political profit in dividing people, playing on race, religion, stoking up fears. It is really unacceptable and I think morally reprehensible,\\\\\\\" he said.  The other cautionary tale, especially for significant nations such as China, India, Japan and Indonesia, is to go easy on nationalism. In these days of fragmented loyalties, it may not be a bad thing to stress a national identity and character. But that's quite different from pushing an excessively nationalist agenda, which can be dangerous.

This week, those ties went further south when Beijing drew Asean's largest member-nation into the South China Sea dispute by saying it has \\\\\\\"overlapping claims\\\\\\\" with Indonesia on waters around the Natunas.  It is a slippery slope when passion replaces reasoned argument. The political considerations that informed some in the Leave camp were all too evident when Justice Secretary Michael Gove, who is for Brexit, pronounced himself \\\\\\\"sick of experts\\\\\\\" after one credible voice after another stood up for the Remain argument.  More frightening, the Leave camp did not seem to care about the wider implications of Brexit. As this newspaper reported on Monday, pro-Europe Scotland could never accept Brexit without planning its own exit from the UK.  With the referendum done, Europe now has to work even harder to ensure that it does not lose so much of what it has gained in the past half-century.  Last week, British entrepreneur Richard Branson, whose grandfather fought in World War I and his own father in World War II, reminded readers in published newspaper advertisements that not a single bullet had been fired between the armies of EU member states. \\\\\\\"I truly believe that one of the EU's greatest achievements is that it has kept its members out of conflict in Europe,\\\\\\\" he wrote.  The role of media, too, will need some scrutiny. Ms Jo Cox, the murdered MP, used to complain bitterly about the unrestrained hate messages she often got on social media from people who disagreed with her.  \\\\\\\"It is not a big journey from saying horrible things to doing horrible things,\\\\\\\" Labour MP Stephen Kinnock, who was a close friend of Ms Cox, told the BBC after her death. Good politicians like Ms Cox keep their constituents close. What if, because of fears over safety, that proximity will have to be restricted?  The boost the Leave campaign got from the mass-circulation Sun, owned by Mr Rupert Murdoch, has not been missed. In Liverpool last week, a cabbie who was for Remain expressed his deep anger at people being misled by this \\\\\\\"American-owned Sun\\\\\\\".  What skin did Mr Murdoch have in the Brexit game? According to London's Evening Standard newspaper, he once confessed he was so opposed to Europe because \\\\\\\"when I go into Downing Street they do what I say; when I go to Brussels they take no notice\\\\\\\".  It is an old quote and to be fair to the media tycoon, his other paper The Times had lent tenuous support editorially for Remain. Even so, it is a point worth pondering.  The recent vote is not the last word on European integration - or disintegration - only a key punctuation mark along the road. The gains by Germany's Alternative for Deutschland and Ms Marine Le Pen's National Front in France suggest that the winds of xenophobia and isolationism may be only just starting in the continent.

President Barack Obama attracted much attention, positive and negative, for his comments during his April trip to the UK, advocating for Britain to remain in the EU. The invitation to come to London was almost certainly a consequence of an urgent request from Prime Minister David Cameron, who was sensing that he was losing the argument for Britain to \\\\\\\"Remain\\\\\\\" rather than \\\\\\\"Leave\\\\\\\" the European Union.  Obama's primary argument was trade, that is, the UK would, in his words, \\\\\\\"go to the end of the queue\\\\\\\" for a trade arrangement with the U.S. if it left the EU and thus, presumably, the TTIP now negotiated between the U.S. and the EU. But he also said that the UK would lose \\\\\\\"global influence,\\\\\\\" while reassuring his British listeners that the \\\\\\\"special relationship\\\\\\\" would remain. Yet without as much global influence, Britain's value for the U.S. could well diminish.  While the U.S. leader remains very popular in Britain, hence the value to Cameron of the invitation, the impact of his remarks was reduced by the \\\\\\\"free rider\\\\\\\" label he had given to Britain a few weeks earlier in reporter Jeffrey Goldberg's \\\\\\\"The Obama Doctrine\\\\\\\" article in The Atlantic. Also, Britain's chattering classes were aghast that the United States could recommend a policy of (continuing) diminution of British sovereignty to Brussels of a type the U.S. Congress would never tolerate itself. Worse still, making the case for trade and global influence was over-intellectualizing an argument, which has been reduced in the final lap to attitudes about national autonomy and immigration. The latter, mercifully, lacks much of a racist dimension. Instead, it reflects concern at the hundreds of thousands of Poles, Bulgarians, Romanians, and others who have come to live and to try to find work in Britain, undercutting wages and putting a strain on health and education services.  Before analyzing the impact of a \\\\\\\"Brexit,\\\\\\\" we note the implicit assumption just in the question of the role of Brexit on bilateral relations: that the U.S. will continue to play its global role at the center of a nearly universal security, trade, legal, and \\\\\\\"values\\\\\\\" order, and thus \\\\\\\"care\\\\\\\" about such decisions by a key ally. But Donald Trump has called that role into question. Nevertheless, assuming the U.S. continues its traditional global role, the implications of Brexit on it are significant but not dramatic.  In the core security/intelligence fields, little will change. The U.S. and UK were bosom allies for 30 years before Britain joined the EU; the bilateral venues of security cooperation: nuclear, intelligence, and military arrangements, NATO membership, UN Security Council partnership, and \\\\\\\"Five Eyes\\\\\\\" intelligence cooperation in Cyber and other fields (the three other 'Anglo' countries in that arrangement are not EU members), will undoubtedly continue untarnished.  But the UK's \\\\\\\"soft power\\\\\\\" role as a complement to the U.S. will take a serious hit, to which Obama alluded. Around the world, the professional international class -- diplomats, military, international financial and business figures, and cosmopolitan political leaders, the \\\\\\\"Davos class\\\\\\\" of global shakers and movers -- will see a vote for EU exit as a sign of the British population's, and thus any government's, waning interest in the country's global role.

This general weakening of soft power will be manifest in two ways. First, Britain has served as a strong and effective force for a more Anglo-American approach to governance, financial, trade and commercial issues within the EU, helping, along with allies in the EU's north -- Germany, Netherlands, and the Scandinavian countries -- to dilute the EU's inherent tendency towards statism, anti-business initiatives, over-regulation and visceral anti-Americanism, as reflected by much of the EU's permanent bureaucracy and in varying degrees its southern member states. That all goes with Brexit.  What also goes is British input into the EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy, largely launched at Maastricht in 1993. Generally speaking, the UK has been an advocate within the EU for NATO's predominant role in European security, including the diplomatic arrangements that undergird military decisions. Without the weight of Britain, France and other countries suspicious of NATO as an American \\\\\\\"Trojan Horse\\\\\\\" into EU diplomacy could push for a much greater security role for EU institutions, reducing NATO's, and thus America's, essential political military role -- and with it, the political links between the U.S. and Western Europe, just when that role and those links are needed to deal with Moscow and a turbulent Middle East.  In terms of economics, financial services are much more important than trade. The primacy of London over Frankfurt and Paris persists. What should be the big question is whether U.S. and other foreign banks, will think they need to shift their operations from London to the continent. The hope, at least in the \\\\\\\"Leave\\\\\\\" camp, is that they do not need to. The \\\\\\\"Remain\\\\\\\" camp argues the banks would leave if there was \\\\\\\"Brexit.\\\\\\\" Economists and business people are split - though most seem to prefer the choice to remain. For ordinary people the debate is just noise.  Trade-wise, Europe is Britain's major trading partner, but Brexit supporters think changed regulatory frameworks will not be disadvantageous. An economist friend notes that Britain is currently the largest market for German cars as well as the biggest consumer of French champagne. Are Berlin and Paris really going to be mean and impose tariffs that will harm their own businesses? American businesses hoping to pick up some opportunities need to remember though that British measurements have gone metric, except for road distances and car speeds.  Britain is not part of the Eurozone, so its departure would not have a direct currency implication, but the markets are already marking down sterling in anticipation. Even so, Brexit would be a blow to the Euro, which has turned into a straitjacket for many European economies, particularly the Mediterranean ones. Further weaknesses for the Euro would have implications for the U.S. dollar, most likely strengthening it and thus stifling much needed trade expansion.  An exit vote, or just a narrow remain victory, will alter another status quo -- the positions of Scotland and Northern Ireland. The Scottish Nationalists favor EU membership and will almost certainly press for another referendum on independence. The situation in Northern Ireland is more complex but will also be in flux. Ultimately though, leave or remain, there will still be that bond of a common language. We think the same. Well, at least sort of. And most of the time.

So far, polls suggest support is split fairly evenly between the \\\\\\\"remain\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"leave\\\\\\\" camps.  W  A decision by Britain to break its nearly half-century relationship with the European continent would be unprecedented. The move could roil global markets and shake multinational employers, with serious consequences for global workers, job seekers, and investors - - both within and outside of Europe.  While Brexit supporters say that independence from the continent would reduce the costs of bureaucracy and overregulation, the British Treasury itself has warned that the move could leave the nation \\\\\\\"permanently poorer,\\\\\\\" by damaging trade, employment and productivity.  If one more person tells me voting Remain is for the rich: WHO WILL SUFFER IF THE EXPERTS ARE RIGHT AND 100K JOBS GO AND WELFARE IS SLASHED?  Before you start feeling relieved not to live in the U.K., remember that in today's globalized economy, the fates of nations are interconnected. Investors fleeing the pound or euro might drive up the value of the U.S. dollar, for example, which could hurt global demand for American products. That's bad for American companies - and the people who work for them.  \\\\\\\"  It's unlikely that a Brexit would push the U.S. economy into recession, Boston University economics professor Robert Margo said. However, the simple fact that nothing like this has ever occurred before means nobody can easily predict what may follow, he added.  \\\\\\\"There might be a short-run negative effect on the British and the European economies, which could affect the U.S. economy and potentially generate a slowdown in employment growth,\\\\\\\" Margo . \\\\\\\"Generally, the expectation is that the effects will not be huge, but that could change if the E.U. decides it's extremely angry and takes retaliatory measures.\\\\\\\"  Even if stocks and other markets take only a short-term hit, other global economic effects might keep rippling out over the next six to 12 months, Margo s  Source: Mic/Getty Images  Why is this happening?  A scary dimension to the Brexit debate is how it reflects growing racial and social tensions in the U.K. - a trend that Americans might find familiar.  In addition to gripes about E.U. bureaucracy, a leading criticism by Britons in favor of an exit is that Europe is too open to immigration. Those sentiments have already had serious consequences: Pro-immigration and anti-Brexit U.K. legislator Jo Cox was killed last week, allegedly targeted by a right-wing extremist.  The impulse to close borders, both in the U.K. and U.S., should worry those who care about a healthy global economy, said Harvard economist Carmen Reinhart.  International trade still has not fully recovered since the downturn in 2008, she said, and the nationalism driving support for Brexit and presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump does not spell good news for cross-border exchange.  \\\\\\\"Barring immigrants and looking inward in terms of trade is an invitation for your neighbors to do the same,\\\\\\\" Reinhart said. \\\\\\\"One of the things that made the Great Depression worse was the rise of inward-looking and retaliatory policies in the 1930s.

Investors pulled $6.1 billion from U.S.-based stock funds during the weekly period ended June 22, the data showed. That was the most pulled from the funds since the week ended May 4.  \\\\\\\"The theme is Brexit, and people are concerned,\\\\\\\" said Tom Roseen, head of research services for Thomson Reuters Lipper.  Voting closed in the so-called \\\\\\\"Brexit\\\\\\\" referendum on Thursday, and early surveys pointed to voters' choosing to remain in the bloc.  The weeks before the vote brought dire predictions of economic fallout if Britain decides to leave.  Yet those fears eased in the days before the vote as polls suggested a remain vote might triumph.  U.S. fund investors fled stocks as MSCI's 46-country All World index recorded five straight days of gains.  In the latest week, investors pulled $1.8 billion from U.S.-based stock mutual funds and withdrew $4.3 billion from stock ETFs, according to Lipper data.  Similarly, U.S.-based funds invested in European stocks posted $857 million in outflows during the week, their third straight week of outflows and largest since the week ended May 11. Those funds rose an average 5.3 percent during the week, Lipper performance data shows.  High-yield bond funds, which often move in tandem with stocks, recorded $766 million in outflows. And global debt funds returned $325 million in cash to investors, according to Lipper.  By contrast, precious metals funds took in $662 million and their eighth straight week of inflows, Lipper said.  \\\\\\\"Investors have been trying to find places to hide,\\\\\\\" said Roseen.  Taxable-bond funds in the United States attracted $2.5 billion during the same period, reversing outflows from the week prior. Relatively safe money-market funds took in $1.2 billion, the research service said.  Roseen said the withdrawals leave money on the sidelines that could be redeployed in stocks in the coming weeks.

The Texas and Confederate flags fly from a cart as revelers gather along the Boulevard of the Republic at the Republic of Texas Biker Rally in Austin, Texas June 13, 2015.  This article originally appeared at International Business Times.  Can it happen in Texas, too?  The United Kingdom's bombshell decision to quit the European Union has emboldened a long-gestating secessionist movement in Texas, where disenchanted residents of the second-largest U.S. state have been building a coalition of voters, hoping to finally put the matter of Texas independence up for a state referendum vote.  Supporters of a so-called Texit say they feel a kinship with their British brethren, who shocked the world Thursday with a \\\\\\\"leave\\\\\\\" vote of 52 percent that defied the predictions of many experts.  \\\\\\\"From the looks of it, the British people have chosen to take control of their political and economic destiny,\\\\\\\" Daniel Miller, president of the Texas Nationalist Movement, said in a statement early Friday. \\\\\\\"The forces of fear have lost. It is now important for Texas to look to \\\\u202a \\\\u200e Brexit as an inspiration and an example that Texans can also take control of our destiny. It is time for Texans to rally with us and fight for the right to become a self-governing nation.\\\\\\\"  The Texas Nationalist Movement bills itself as the \\\\\\\"largest independence movement in the United States\\\\\\\" and one of the largest in the world. Members say they have been recruiting support from hundreds of elected officials in the state legislature and have been collecting signatures from voters, asking them to pledge a \\\\\\\"yes\\\\\\\" vote.  The movement suffered a blow at the Texas Republican Convention in May, when state delegates declined to endorse the idea of a referendum on secession, but that it got as far as it did was a surprise to many who have dismissed a Texit as an impractical solution dreamed up by a fringe movement.  Now, with Britons voting to go it alone, Texas nationalists are getting a second wind. Across social media Friday, revitalized Lone Stars voiced their support under the hashtag #Texit, saying it's time to take the idea seriously. Like the Brexit movement, the modern rise of Texas nationalism is driven by a mix of economic and political ideals, including a conservative distaste for big government and polarizing attitudes toward immigration policies. Underpinning both movements is the idea that large unions are no longer serving the needs of their individual member states.  The matter of Texas has bubbled up from time to time since the Civil War, in part due to the state's unique history. Texas declared independence from Mexico in 1836 and was a sovereign country for a decade before becoming annexed by the United States.  But despite the popular belief that the current Texas constitution gives the state the right to pull out of the United States at will, the Supreme Court has said otherwise, ruling in 1869 that states can not unilaterally secede from the union, as the Texas Tribune noted.  Still, that same news outlet conceded in April that the secession debate is \\\\\\\"getting kind of real,\\\\\\\" while the Texas Nationalist Movement points out that no actual law exists that expressly forbids secession.

Richard Burr, a the North Carolina Republican chairman of the Senate intelligence committee, said that \\\\\\\"while there will be a great deal of discussion in the coming days and weeks about what the 'Leave' win means for them and for us, our friends and allies in the UK should know this: we respect their decision, and we stand by them, just as they have always stood by us.\\\\\\\"  Others used the vote to make a point about domestic politics.

Expats who spoke to Gulf News questioned the future of their home country following news that the 'Leave' side garnered 1.2 million more votes than the 'Remain' camp, following a highly divisive campaign, to clinch 52 per cent of the vote.  The shock of the UK's departure within the next two years deepened on Friday when Prime Minister David Cameron announced he will resign by October to allow 150,000 Tory party members to appoint a new prime minister to negotiate the country's exit.  It will be up to a new prime minister to trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which sets forth a two-year timetable to 'Leave' the EU, reducing country membership to 27.  Jonathan Howell-Jones, a UK expat living in Dubai, said he was disheartened by the referendum outcome and wondered what the future holds for Great Britain if a member of the union such as Scotland could hold their own referendum to 'Leave' the UK.  \\\\\\\"I am gutted,\\\\\\\" said Howell-Jones, adding Great Britain could soon be \\\\\\\"Little England\\\\\\\" if the Kingdom were to be broken up by further referenda. \\\\\\\"The biggest concern I have is that the heart was clearly over the head. I think this is a black day in our history.\\\\\\\"  Howell-Jones said the vote in favour of 'Leave' may not bode well for UK expats living abroad and in the UAE given that the UK may now be viewed as isolationist.  \\\\\\\"I do not think it will reflect well on the British community here in the UAE,\\\\\\\" he said.  Holly Stringer, a UK expat living in the UAE, said she was feeling mixed emotions for the UK of tomorrow.  \\\\\\\"I am happy and scared at the same time,\\\\\\\" Stringer told Gulf News.  Expat Jon Clarke, a resident of Dubai, said Friday was a good day for the UK and restores sovereignty to the country.  \\\\\\\"I am surprised. I did not think we would do it. I thought we would bottle it and not 'Leave',\\\\\\\" Clarke told Gulf News on Friday. \\\\\\\"This is a very good thing and will get rid of the EU bureaucrats meddling in the UK's affairs.\\\\\\\"  Clarke, 46, said those who voted to 'Leave' did not believe appointed EU officials should hold so much sway over the internal running of the country.  \\\\\\\"To keep UK in the EU financial stream was okay at one point but to interfere in our country's political decisions was just wrong,\\\\\\\" he said. \\\\\\\"It's a good day for England.\\\\\\\"  The reaction on social media was mixed with some lamenting that the decision to 'Leave' was an embarassing moment both personally and internationally.  Orlando Crowcroft, a former UK expat living in Dubai, voiced his displeasure at the vote on his Facebook account.  \\\\\\\"Shocked, really, ashamed, worried - but embarassed mostly,\\\\\\\" he said.  The UK Ambassador to the United Arab Emirates Philip Parham said in a statement to Gulf News on Friday: \\\\\\\"The UK remains the fifth largest economy in the world, a permanent member of the UN Security Council and a member of the G7, G20 and NATO [and will ] continue to be the only member of those groups which spends both 2% of GDP on defence and 0.7 per cent on development assistance.

Here's what Daniel Miller, the head honcho of the TNM, said to Australian news outlet News.com.au:  Mr Miller says the core reason for the movement is a firm belief that the best people to govern Texas are the people of Texas, as opposed to the Washington-based federal government. \\\\\\\"At this moment, we do not enjoy that right,\\\\\\\" he said. \\\\\\\"The vast majority of the laws, rules and regulations that affect the people of Texas are created by the political class or unelected bureaucrats in Washington.\\\\\\\"  Miller did not specify what those oppressive \\\\\\\"laws, rules and regulations\\\\\\\" were, exactly, but we'd be willing to bet they have to do with taking away Texans' sacred rights to dump toxic sludge, tell Those People (for multiple values of THEM) to get the hell out of their restaurants, and something something all the guns.

It should, instead, set off alarm bells about the future of the European project.  British Prime Minister David Cameron's campaign to keep the United Kingdom in the EU was defeated by 52 percent to 48 percent despite overwhelming support from voters in Scotland, Northern Ireland, and London. The United Kingdom must now negotiate its exit from the EU under the terms of Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. These negotiations could last up to two years-thereby creating a period of uncertainty for global financial markets and political sentiment on the European continent.

Claire Yorke, a nonresident senior fellow at the Council's Brent Scowcroft Center on International Security moderated the call.

There was also a significant split between young and older voters. A majority of voters under the age of forty-nine were in favor of Remain with at least 75 percent under the age of twenty-four saying they had voted in favor of the United Kingdom remaining in the EU, according to a YouGov poll. A majority of older voters backed Leave.  The reaction among the youth is \\\\\\\"how could people be so irresponsible and dumb and misled by what they would regard as misinformation,\\\\\\\" said Westmacott. \\\\\\\"This is not a generation which is wildly enamored with the concept of an ever closer union.

The referendum is as much about disillusionment with the political status quo and a continuing sense in the United States and in the United Kingdom that the hard-working, tax-paying middleclass are being ignored while those responsible for the global financial crisis in 2008 continue to prosper and have not been held accountable, said Westmacott.  \\\\\\\"I very much hope that this does not prove to be the pulling of a thread on the old jumper.

But can Barack Obama leverage what remains of the \\\\\\\"special relationship\\\\\\\" to smooth its exit and limit the damage to Western security and the global economy?  The US president travelled to London during the referendum campaign to back his friend Prime Minister David Cameron's doomed campaign against Brexit.  And on Friday he was quick to defend the enduring \\\\\\\"special relationship,\\\\\\\" a phrase coined by Winston Churchill in 1946 after the Allies' World War II victory.  Nevertheless, Washington analysts were unanimous that the shock result was a huge setback for the alliance and for US interests -- and urged Obama to help fix things.  Following the vote, Britain will have to negotiate its departure from the world's biggest trading bloc without triggering a domino effect of economic catastrophe.  After speaking to Cameron on Friday, Obama said he was \\\\\\\"confident that the UK is committed to an orderly transition out of the EU.\\\\\\\"  But European leaders have warned that they will not give London an easy ride, fearing that a smooth Brexit will encourage other European powers to jump ship.  - Divides allies -  That would be counterproductive, warned Tom Wright of the Brookings Institution, if a stormy debate further disturbs markets and divides US allies in Europe.  \\\\\\\"In the last few weeks European leaders have taken a tough line and said there will not be concessions, but that may change now that the vote has happened,\\\\\\\" he said.  \\\\\\\"I do think the US position will almost certainly and correctly be to try to make this as smooth as possible.\\\\\\\"  Wright did not downplay the scale of the harm Brexit would do to trans-Atlantic cooperation but said Obama could \\\\\\\"mitigate\\\\\\\" it by reaching out to France and Germany.  \\\\\\\"The most important decisions will be taken in Berlin and in Paris,\\\\\\\" he told AFP in an interview.  \\\\\\\"And if the US is going to engage these countries it will have to be at the leader level.\\\\\\\"  There is a lot of anger in Washington at what experts see as Cameron's unnecessary gamble on a referendum, but most hope the alliance will survive.  \\\\\\\"Nothing will be served by pushing the UK away or by retaliating by diminishing the alliance,\\\\\\\" said Wright.  Jeffrey Rathke, a fellow of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told AFP that the fundamentals of the alliance remain in place.  \\\\\\\"The reason for the special relationship is basically because we have very similar interests and very similar ways of looking at the world,\\\\\\\" he said.  \\\\\\\"However, if Britain's influence globally decreases then the US naturally has to find ways to compensate for that,\\\\\\\" he warned.  \\\\\\\"The US will have to beef up its engagement with key European partners.\\\\\\\"  This analysis was shared by Richard Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations, who told reporters that Brexit was a harsh blow for the United States.  - 'Less special' -  \\\\\\\"The net result will be the special relationship will be that much less special,\\\\\\\" he said.  \\\\\\\"This essentially is a cloud without a silver lining when it comes to the UK itself, when it comes to Europe or when it comes to the United States.  \\\\\\\"On balance this will diminish order within Europe and arguably beyond.\\\\\\\"  So a disaster then, in the eyes of experts, but could Obama have done more to steer his ally through the mess of its own making?

{"instruction": "Extract attitudes between entities and topics from the article in JSON format and categorize them [Positive, Neutral, Negative] and justify them quoting the article", "input": "Following last night's historic Brexit vote, House Speaker Paul Ryan's primary challenger, Wisconsin businessman Paul Nehlen, seems to have taken a page from the playbook of the U.K. Independence Party (UKIP) with the launch of a new billboard campaign.  On Friday morning, Nehlen's campaign went live with a new billboard in Ryan's hometown of Janesville, Wisconsin that is reminiscent of the distinctive UKIP-style campaign.  The ad reads: \\\\\\\"Radical Islam Kills Americans. Vote YES for Immigration Control. Vote NO for Paul Ryan.\\\\\\\"  The billboard then directs viewers to Nehlen's campaign website, ElectNehlen.com.  UKIP's national billboard campaign is distinctive for its clear, straight-forward manner of describing the effects of large-scale migration and its impact on workers and Western culture.  \\\\\\\"This is the first of many billboards our campaign will be launching to inform the voters about what's at stake on August 9th,\\\\\\\" Nehlen told Breitbart.  As Nehlen's billboard suggests, Paul Ryan has a two-decade long history of pushing for open border immigration policies - including his 2015 effort to fund President Obama's expansion to the U.S. refugee resettlement operation.  In speeches, Ryan has made the case for policies that would effectively dissolve U.S. borders - declaring that the U.S. \\\\\\\"is more than [its] borders.\\\\\\\" Ryan has even articulated his support for implementing an immigration system similar to the open borders policy of the European Union - calling for \\\\\\\"an economic-based immigration system where\\\\u2026 labor and supply can meet each other so we can help fuel our economy and create jobs.\\\\\\\"  The phrase \\\\\\\"labor supply and demand can meet each other,\\\\\\\" is a centerpiece of open borders thought. Under this global, one-world theory, any willing employer should be able to hire any willing worker regardless of what country he or she lives in. This view, that America is an \\\\\\\"idea\\\\\\\" and not a \\\\\\\"nation,\\\\\\\" sees borders as an obstacle to commerce.  With regards to Islamic migration, Ryan's controversial omnibus spending bill funded U.S. visas for nearly 300,000 (permanent and temporary) Muslim migrants in a single year.  While polling data shows that the Republican electorate overwhelmingly backs proposals to temporarily pause Muslim migration, Ryan has rejected such proposals.  He has repeatedly ruled out the possibility of making any cuts to Muslim migration- insisting that \\\\\\\"that's not who we are,\\\\\\\" and that such a proposal is \\\\\\\"not reflective of our principles.\\\\\\\"  However, Ryan has not explained how importing hundreds of thousands of migrants from nations that hold sentiments that are anti-women, anti-gay, anti-religious tolerance, and anti-America benefits the United States or helps to protect our Western values.  Indeed, as a result of large-scale Muslim migration, the U.S. has imported several practices and values that are antithetical to Western principles.  For instance, Muslim migration has put half a million U.S. girls and women at risk of suffering the barbaric and misogynistic practice of Female Genital Mutilation, according to Equality Now.

Between 2001 and 2014, the U.S. permanently resettled more than 40,000 migrants from Afghanistan on green cards.  Additionally, between 2001 and 2014, the U.S. permanently resettled 674,920 migrants from nations where gays can be executed, according to data from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).  This figure does not include the total number of migrants the U.S. has permanently resettled from Muslim nations during that time, which is nearly 1.7 million.  The current rate of U.S. immigration is record high. Every day the U.S. admits enough net immigrants to fill an overcrowded, metropolitan high school. Every month the U.S. imports a population of immigrants that is larger than the occupancy of Lambeau Field, where the Green Bay Packers play.  Since Wisconsin voters sent Paul Ryan to Washington, the U.S. has imported a population of immigrants that is nearly three times larger than the entire population of Wisconsin.  In seven years time - unless Congress takes action to curb U.S. visa distributions - the foreign-born share of the U.S. population will reach an all-time high. In the 1920s, the last time the foreign-born share of the population reached a record high, then-President Calvin Coolidge hit the pause button for roughly fifty years, producing an era of explosive wage growth and allowing immigrants already in the country to assimilate.  Paul Ryan, however, has made clear that he does not wish to curb immigration, but instead has pushed legislation that would substantially increase immigration.  According to Pew polling data, 92 percent of the GOP electorate - and 83 percent of the American electorate as a whole - is opposed to such an agenda and wants to see immigration levels frozen or reduced. Ryan represents only a minuscule seven percent of the GOP electorate that wants to increase migration rates.

Sinn Fein has called for a vote on reunifying Ireland and Northern Ireland, and pressure is mounting from the Scottish National Party for a second independence referendum. The rest of the EU is in no way insulated from the impact of the Brexit vote. Within hours of the UK's decision, the news had been welcomed by \\\\\\\"insurgent\\\\\\\" parties across the continent - the Front National in France, the PVV in the Netherlands; the AFD in Germany; Lega Nord in Italy; and FPO in Austria, all calling for the referendum to be emulated in their countries.  Across Europe, traditional political elites are being challenged by newer, smaller, and leaner parties from both left and right. They are winning office - currently holding 1,329 seats in 25 countries - and playing a role in government in eight member states. They are capturing the political agenda and forcing mainstream parties to adopt their positions. Their weapon of choice is undoubtedly the referendum, used to whip up popular support for their pet issues.  Now more than ever, it is important to understand what these new political forces stand for, and what they really think. ECFR has carried out the first comprehensive survey of these outsiders, identifying 45 parties, analysing their public statements, and interviewing the representatives of 41 of them - the full results will be published Monday.  We found that, though these \\\\\\\"insurgents\\\\\\\" come from across the political spectrum, from hard left to far right, some key trends can be identified in their views on international affairs, which are challenging some of the basic tenets of the European consensus. They are broadly sceptical about the EU, resent the United States, and are sympathetic to Vladimir Putin's Russia. They prefer borders closed, migration low, and trade protected. Above all, they want to return power to the people through direct democracy.  The UK's vote on the EU and the Dutch vote on Ukraine could be just the first in a landslide of popular referendums across Europe. ECFR's research found that outsider parties across the EU have plans to push for votes on 34 issues that would have direct consequences for the EU in the coming years. These insurgent forces are using the media, popular pressure, and political office to force national referendums on issues that were previously the preserve of governments and civil servants.  Insurgent parties are winning seats in local, regional, national, and European parliaments, and challenging establishment views on how policymaking should be done. In the forthcoming Spanish national elections, a coalition led by Podemos looks capable of displacing the ruling Socialists. In Italy, the Five Star Movement won the mayoral elections in Rome.  The outsiders are bolstered by shifts in the political climate. Foreign policy in particular is no longer an elite game, conducted behind closed doors by small coteries of politicians and diplomats. In the run-up to the referendum on EU membership, stirring speeches by David Cameron and Tony Blair on the risks for Britain's security and the global impact of leaving the EU fell on deaf ears. People care little about a seat at an international table if its consequences at a national and local level are not clearly communicated.

Who are Europe's new insurgent parties?  This study looks at voices outside the political mainstream that are influencing and shaping the development of EU foreign policy today. For each member state we selected the most influential non-mainstream groups - for some countries such as Slovakia or the Czech Republic, where there are many such parties, we focused on a selection. The only member state in which we decided there was no relevant party was Luxembourg.  The parties we have included are not exclusively of the right or the left, ranging from the Communist Party in France and socialist Die Linke in Germany, through to far-right groups such as Golden Dawn in Greece, Lega Nord in Italy, and Jobbik in Hungary. Some challenge the establishment from the sidelines, and some, such as Law and Justice in Poland, and Syriza and the Independent Greeks in Greece, are serving in current coalition governments. The insurgent parties are broadly sceptical about the EU in its current state. Their positions range vastly within this, from France's Front National and Britain's UKIP, which was founded with the aim of taking the UK out of the EU, through to Portugal's Left Bloc and Spain's Podemos, which advocate for EU reform.  A sense of the need to \\\\\\\"re-democratise\\\\\\\" policymaking nationally and across the EU is common to almost all these parties, with Switzerland often held up as an example. They all see their role as speaking the truth and challenging the elites on behalf of the people. The youngest, ALFA, was formed in Germany in July 2015 as a breakaway from anti-immigrant party Alternative f\\\\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD), while the oldest, Ireland's Sinn F\\\\u00e9in, was founded in 1905.  Foreign policy  Through interviews with foreign policy representatives of each party that agreed to meet up - 41 out of the 45 we covered - and analysis of their public pronouncements, we explored their positions on the key foreign policy challenges facing the EU. These include the refugee crisis and the EU's relationship with Turkey; security and terrorist threats to Europe; the Ukraine crisis and the EU's relationship with Russia; EU-US relations, including on Middle East policy and trade; and the UK referendum.  Most of the parties focus primarily on domestic issues, and some lack fully developed foreign policy positions - for example, different representatives of Germany's AfD gave different answers on foreign policy, and other party representatives stated that they could only answer in a personal capacity. But even newer parties, which have had less time to elaborate policy beyond the core issues on which they were founded, are quickly developing their positions on foreign policy. They are driven towards this by the impact of the refugee crisis across the EU, and the interplay between its foreign and domestic dimensions.  There was a surprising amount of consensus on the existential threats facing the EU. For 34 out of the 45 parties covered, the refugee crisis or the threat of terrorism and radical Islamism (these issues were inextricably linked in the responses of most) were among the top two threats facing the EU. This response was not the preserve of the right wing: it was shared by Germany's Die Linke, the French Communist Party, Spain's Podemos, and the Lithuanian Labour Party.

US strategy in the Middle East was the most popular answer, with the violence sponsored by President Bashar al-Assad's regime in Syria in second place.  There is widespread scepticism around European or US interventionism generally, particularly in the Middle East. This sentiment was expressed by parties ranging from Ireland's Sinn F\\\\u00e9in, Britain's UKIP, France's Front National and Communist Party, Germany's AfD and Die Linke, Hungary's Jobbik, and Italy's Five Star Movement. On the prospect of collective European intervention in Syria, 32 parties responded that this should not even be on the table.  This position is linked to a general anti-Americanism and a distaste for the EU toeing the US line, particularly on Middle East policy. As the Front National told our researcher: \\\\\\\"The roots of all the main conflicts in Europe and its neighbourhoods can be tracked back to the actions of Washington as a hegemonic power.\\\\\\\" For many insurgent parties, this spurning of transatlanticism is also linked to strong suspicions about the impact of TTIP, with 27 of the parties interviewed answering that the EU should not make this deal with the US. But there were some notable exceptions among the parties that we interviewed - including the Sweden Democrats, the Danish People's Party, the Finns Party, the Estonian Party of People's Unity, Germany's ALFA, Syriza, and the Independent Greeks - who thought the deal could have a positive impact under the right conditions.  In terms of policy towards Europe's neighbourhood, there is a general consensus among the insurgent parties that more enlargement would be a bad thing - that the EU is big enough and, if anything, should be gradually dissolved. However, there is slightly more openness to the inclusion of countries to the east (notably Ukraine) than to the south (notably Turkey, with major fears expressed about the possibility of Turkish accession). Still, only 10 parties responded unequivocally that they supported Ukraine's path to EU accession and, of these, two would not support NATO accession for Ukraine (UKIP's position was the reverse, supporting Ukraine joining NATO but not the EU).  Perhaps the most significant issue that divides the challenger parties is how to engage with Russia. There is general sympathy for Russian foreign policy (30 parties expressed support for at least some recent Russian positions, particularly its intervention in Syria, in the absence of other actors taking a decisive position on the conflict), and a sense that the EU's policy on its neighbourhood should not be pitted against that of Russia. However, when it comes to specific policies such as EU sanctions against Russia, views were much more mixed. Twenty-four parties argued that the sanctions should not stay in place beyond July, with parties as diverse as the French Communist Party, Cyprus's AKEL, Dawn and other Czech parties, and Syriza and the Independent Greeks viewing them as an obstacle to dialogue with Russia, and damaging to EU economies.  These views on Russia policy do not fall naturally along the lines of left and right, but tend more towards national perspectives - for example, in Germany, both Die Linke and AfD believe that the sanctions on Russia should be lifted, while in Greece, Syriza and Golden Dawn agree on this. On the question of Ukraine's accession, however, more of a left-right split is evident, with parties on the left generally more supportive of Ukraine's path to EU membership.  How are the insurgent parties influencing foreign policy?

However, for many of these groups, their most effective levers of influence are their ability to drive debate in the media and challenge the establishment rather than working within it.  For example, although Britain's UKIP has been successful in European Parliament elections - it is the largest UK party, with 22 MEPs - and at local level, with 488 councillors, it holds only one seat in the UK House of Commons. Its major success has been outside its elected role, stirring the debate on UK membership of the EU to a degree that reopened rifts in the ruling Conservative Party, so that Prime Minister David Cameron felt it necessary to put the matter to a national vote.  The referendum is a tool that appeals strongly to challenger parties, resonating with their wish to \\\\\\\"re-democratise\\\\\\\" decision-making. The 2016 Dutch referendum on the Ukraine Association Agreement had strong backing from the PVV, and the UK Brexit vote is undeniably a success story for UKIP. Many of the parties we interviewed saw the building momentum of referendums in 2016 as an opportunity.  However, insurgent parties are also working within government: in Bulgaria, the Patriotic Front supports the governing coalition; in Finland, the Finns Party is participating in the ruling coalition and its leader, Timo Soini, is serving as Foreign Minister; in Greece, Syriza and the Independent Greeks are currently in government; in Hungary, Fidesz is the leading party in the governing coalition. In Latvia, the National Alliance holds a number of high offices including the Ministry of Justice; in Lithuania both the Order and Justice Party and the Labour Party are in government; Law and Justice are in power in Poland; and SMER-SD and the Slovak National Party are two of the four-party governing coalition in Slovakia. Polls ahead of the 26 June national elections in Spain are putting the Podemos-led coalition in a strong position. The odds are strong that the Front National's Marine Le Pen will make it into the second round of the French presidential elections in 2017.  As this study shows, these parties are not all of one mind on key foreign policy challenges, from the war in Syria, to the US relationship and the Ukraine crisis. However, on some broader points it would be possible for coalitions of \\\\\\\"insurgent governments\\\\\\\" to operate within the Foreign Affairs Council. For example, all insurgent parties currently playing a role in their national government answered \\\\\\\"yes\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\"maybe\\\\\\\" when asked whether they wanted to return to business as usual in relations with Russia. Similarly, they shared roughly similar analyses of the causes of the refugee crisis. Following the UK referendum this grouping could also form an important driving force for a process of EU reform. The potential for foreign policy coalitions is greater if these included larger states with governments that are under intense political pressure from insurgent parties, such as France and Spain.  However, our research also shows that challenger parties do not just change the system - the system can also change them. For example, Syriza's experience in government has significantly tempered its pre-government promises of rapprochement with Russia, and the Finns Party has broadly toed the government line on the EU since joining its coalition. This is also true for Bulgaria's Patriotic Front, which has tempered its nationalistic rhetoric and has actually gained popularity after backing the coalition", "output": "{\"topical_attitudes\": [{\"source\": {\"entity\": \"UKIP\", \"references\": [\"UKIP\"]}, \"target\": {\"topic\": \"UK membership of the EU\", \"references\": [\"debate on UK membership of the EU\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"Its major success has been outside its elected role, stirring the debate on UK membership of the EU to a degree that reopened rifts in the ruling Conservative Party\"], \"attitude\": \"Positive\"}, {\"source\": {\"entity\": \"UKIP\", \"references\": [\"UKIP\"]}, \"target\": {\"topic\": \"Brexit\", \"references\": [\"UK Brexit vote\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"The UK Brexit vote is undeniably a success story for UKIP\"], \"attitude\": \"Positive\"}, {\"source\": {\"entity\": \"Syriza\", \"references\": [\"Syriza\"]}, \"target\": {\"topic\": \"Russia\", \"references\": [\"rapprochement with Russia\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"Syriza's experience in government has significantly tempered its pre-government promises of rapprochement with Russia\"], \"attitude\": \"Negative\"}, {\"source\": {\"entity\": \"Finns Party\", \"references\": [\"Finns Party\"]}, \"target\": {\"topic\": \"EU\", \"references\": [\"EU\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"The Finns Party has broadly toed the government line on the EU since joining its coalition\"], \"attitude\": \"Neutral\"}, {\"source\": {\"entity\": \"Patriotic Front\", \"references\": [\"Patriotic Front\"]}, \"target\": {\"topic\": \"nationalistic rhetoric\", \"references\": [\"nationalistic rhetoric\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"the Patriotic Front... has tempered its nationalistic rhetoric\"], \"attitude\": \"Negative\"}, {\"source\": {\"entity\": \"European Parliament\", \"references\": [\"European Parliament\"]}, \"target\": {\"topic\": \"EU-Turkey deal on refugees\", \"references\": [\"vocal opposition to elements of the EU-Turkey deal on refugees\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"the European Parliament's increasingly assertive role in foreign policy -

Finally, it is clear that in addition to developments in the Council, the European Parliament's increasingly assertive role in foreign policy - as seen most recently in its vocal opposition to elements of the EU-Turkey deal on refugees - is set to continue.

Demand for travel was already strong in the U.S., and the vote by the U.K. to leave the European Union will make it cheaper for Americans to visit their British cousins across the pond.  The exit of the United Kingdom from the 28-nation union has pushed the value of the British pound down relative to the U.S. dollar, making it likely that more U.S. travelers will visit Britain to take advantage of the disparity.

Data from the metasearch travel site Liligo.com shows that searches from throughout the world for flights to Britain began to rise Thursday.

In the 12 months leading up to April, the number of visits to the U.K. was 5% higher than the same period a year earlier. The number of visitors who came from North America rose by 11% and jumped 4% from Europe, according to the Office of National Statistics in the U.K.  Meanwhile, the United Kingdom has been a huge source of tourism for the U.S.  The U.K. was the third largest source of international visitors to the U.S. in 2015, behind only Canada and Mexico, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce.  Last year, 4.9 million visitors traveled from the U.K. to the U.S., an 18% increase from the previous year.

If Brits had voted to stay, then markets would have been free to breath a sigh of relief.  Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen holds a news conference following the Federal Open Market Committee meeting in Washington September 17, 2015. JONATHAN ERNST / Reuters  The U.K.'s Treasury itself reported that its analysis showed the nation \\\\\\\"would be permanently poorer\\\\\\\" if it left the EU and adopted any of a number of likely alternatives. \\\\\\\"Productivity and GDP per person would be lower in all these alternative scenarios, as the costs would substantially outweigh any potential benefit of leaving the EU,\\\\\\\" a summary of the report said.  As the overall economy weakens, the British government would see weaker tax receipts than otherwise, and those losses would vastly outweigh the benefits of reduced contributions to the EU, according to the analysis.  The general thinking is that many international corporations, notably those based in the U.S. and China, invest in U.K. operations partly so they can readily access the free-trade corridors the U.K. enjoys with the rest of the European Union. So since the leave camp won, many of those companies could see drastically reduced profits.  The sudden need to reset tons of global investment channels - against the background of the ambiguous and extended period of the U.K.'s exit negotiations - could have a freezing effect on the whole region.  \\\\\\\"Negotiations on post-exit arrangements would likely be protracted, resulting in an extended period of heightened uncertainty that could weigh heavily on confidence and investment, all the while increasing financial market volatility,\\\\\\\" the IMF said in an April report.  \\\\\\\"A U.K. exit from Europe's single market would also likely disrupt and reduce mutual trade and financial flows, curtailing key benefits from economic cooperation and integration, such as those resulting from economies of scale and efficient specialization.  \\\\\\\"Depending on how you measure it, the EU as a whole ranges from the first to the third largest economy in the world. And in terms of trade, the bloc easily topped the U.S. and China in both imports and exports. So a slowdown there would mean a global slowdown. One that could last months - if not years.  In Europe, the EU could run into economic trouble for a couple of reasons. The lengthy and as-yet ambiguous exit negotiations could cripple investment, as mentioned above, but they could also lead to more exits. Nationalist groups across Europe will be watching the referendum closely to see if they can use the results into their advantage.  Elsewhere, the economic risks are best understood as a function of uncertainty. EU uncertainty: If financiers and companies are concerned that they may get cut out of free-trade channels, they may find safer (which is to say, less productive) uses for their money. And British uncertainty: All those billions of dollars already invested in the U.K. and invested abroad by British entities could be in limbo as London rushes to negotiate new non-EU trade deals with key partners.

{"instruction": "Extract attitudes between entities and topics from the article in JSON format and categorize them [Positive, Neutral, Negative] and justify them quoting the article", "input": "The United Kingdom's decision to leave the European Union was historic, significant, unprecedented and decisive - but it wasn't uniform.  It was split by age: Young people overwhelmingly voted to stay, while older generations preferred to leave. It was split by education, with university-educated voters far more likely to be pro-EU.  It was split by choice of preferred newspaper - for instance, readers of The Guardian were inclined to \\\\\\\"remain,\\\\\\\" by 91 percent to 9 percent; readers of The Express wanted to go, by 77 percent to 23 percent, according to a YouGov poll.  And - in a split that could have a transformative impact on British politics - it was sharply divided by geography.  A majority of voters in both Scotland and Northern Ireland cast a vote for the U.K. to remain in the EU. In fact, every single region in Scotland opted to stay.  As a nation, Scotland voted to remain by 62 percent to 38 percent; Northern Ireland was approximately 56 percent in favor of remaining, with 44 percent voting for a \\\\\\\"Brexit,\\\\\\\" or British exit. In contrast, both Wales and England saw approximately 53 percent of voters in favor of leaving the EU. (England's population is much larger than the other nations in the U.K., so the total vote came down on the side of leaving the EU.)  The sharp disconnect has revived the idea of Scotland declaring its independence from the U.K. - and of Northern Ireland leaving to merge with the independent Republic of Ireland, which is an EU member.  You might remember that Scotland held a referendum on independence from the U.K. in 2014. The voters opted for unity. But an imminent departure from the EU changes things, says Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.  Being removed from the EU against the will of Scottish voters, Sturgeon says, is \\\\\\\"democratically unacceptable.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"It's a statement of the obvious that a second referendum [on independence] is on the table,\\\\\\\" she said.  NPR's Sara Goo spoke with voters in Scotland who said they were shocked by the U.K.'s Brexit decision. She reports:  \\\\\\\"The results seemed to confirm to many in Scotland that they do not have a voice in the United Kingdom. And for some, it was further reason for Scotland to align itself with the EU rather than Britain. \\\\\\\" 'I would vote for another referendum' to leave the U.K., said Lana Fisher, 27, of Greenock, Scotland. 'It feels like the Scottish people have voted and our opinion counts for nothing.' \\\\\\\"Fisher and several other Scots interviewed in Glasgow on Friday said they felt Scottish independence from Britain now seemed inevitable. An earlier referendum in 2014 attracted record voters, with many young adults supporting independence, but it was narrowly defeated. \\\\\\\"Christine Black, of Newton Mearns, said she voted for Scotland to remain in the U.K. - but given today's results, she's not sure how she'd vote if another referendum were held. \\\\\\\" 'I do not know what I'd do. I was hoping it would not come to this,' she said. \\\\\\\" 'Are we going to benefit from being part of the U.K. or not? Who's going to be running the country? ... If it's Boris Johnson and then Donald Trump in the U.S., we'd have a real disaster.' \\\\\\\"  Meanwhile, nationalist leaders in Northern Ireland have strengthened calls for the nation to leave the U.K. and unite with their southern neighbor, the Republic of Ireland. Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness, a Sinn Fein politician, is urging a referendum on the question. In Ireland, that hypothetical vote is called a \\\\\\\"border poll.\\\\\\\"  But First Minister Arlene Foster, who is pro-Britain, says it will not be", "output": "{\"topical_attitudes\": [{\"source\": {\"entity\": \"Scotland\", \"references\": [\"Scotland\"]}, \"target\": {\"topic\": \"EU membership\", \"references\": [\"remain in the EU\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"A majority of voters in both Scotland and Northern Ireland cast a vote for the U.K. to remain in the EU.

The President has been sufficiently briefed and officials continue to study the impact of the vote,\\\\\\\" Mr Esipisu said.

President Obama had encouraged Britain to remain in the EU but said the decision was up to voters.  The UK has been one of the most stable economies in the EU bloc, which has been funding numerous projects in Africa, like the African Union Mission in Somalia and trade through the European Development Fund. Following Prime Minister David Cameron's resignation yesterday, his planned State visit to Kenya next month might not materialise.  \\\\\\\"I do not comment on the Prime Minister's diary but the relationship between Kenya and the UK will not be affected by the vote,\\\\\\\" said the UK High Commissioner to Kenya Nic Hailey. According to Kenya's Ambassador to Belgium and the EU Johnson Weru, Kenya stands to gain in terms of bilateral engagements. \\\\\\\"We may gain from this exit in a minimal way. But in the fullness of time, what will give us direction is legislation that will be developed to give effect to the referendum,\\\\\\\" Mr Weru told The Standard on Saturday from Belgium.  Weru acknowledged the instance developments with the Britons vote at the referendum, arguing that Norway and Switzerland are not full members of the EU but they somehow relate with decisions they think are good.  \\\\\\\"For instance, if you have a Schengen Visa, you can enter Switzerland, which is not a member of Schengen. But when doing money transfer, you cannot transfer money directly to Switzerland because the country is not a member of the European monitory system,\\\\\\\" said Weru.

It will be better for the future so that whoever picks up the political leadership of the UK, comes with greater strength, in terms of concluding bilateral agreements instead of being signed by third parties,\\\\\\\" he said.  Weru, who also represents Kenya's national interests, in partnership with other member states of the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) Group of States, noted that the impact of the exit will be on the banking industry. He nevertheless stressed that, \\\\\\\"The world is governed by rules and these rules are clear on the implementation framework.  We have two years of transition, which will allow everybody to bring their pieces on board.\\\\\\\" The ambassador argues that for now, except for the immediate reaction of investment and the money markets, Kenya and the African continent agreement is intact, save for signing of power agreements. \\\\\\\"We will keep the doors open for the next two years.

But the EU has, like other institutions that set the terms of the global economy since World War II, failed to adapt to the upheavals that followed the end of the Cold War, according to Fraser. The question of how to integrate China and Russia, in particular, into largely Western-built economic and security structures was left unanswered. Those institutions were unable to help governments ameliorate inequality or the impact of globalisation on jobs and wages for many in the West. And yet, says Fraser, \\\\\\\"we need a system for running the world; you need systems that set shared rules\\\\\\\".  There is a word for where the world is heading now: \\\\\\\"G-zero,\\\\\\\" a label coined by Ian Bremmer, president of the Eurasia Group, a New York-based political-risk consultancy, and economist Nouriel Roubini in a Foreign Affairs article five years ago. The reference was to the progressive irrelevance of the G-7, G-8 and then G-20 to global governance. Trade was an early indicator. The last full-blown global deal was the so-called Uruguay Round in 1995. Since then, only partial and regional trade pacts have been achievable. Now, as support dwindles for the Trans-Pacific Partnership and a proposal to deepen commerce between the US and the EU, the prospects for even regional agreements are fading. \\\\\\\"Brexit fits very closely\\\\\\\" into this procession towards a world without collaborative international institutions, says Bremmer, noting that campaign on both sides has been almost entirely inward-looking. \\\\\\\"We have moved from a situation in which the transatlantic relationship was the most important thing, to everyone for themselves\\\\\\\". The US presidential contest has also been isolationist, forcing even Hillary Clinton to abandon support for the TPP trade deal she helped to get signed as secretary of state.

The changes under way could also produce new or restructured arrangements for international management, rather than the Hobbesian world Bremmer fears.  China's leaders, for example, have looked on with puzzlement at the British debate. China may champion national sovereignty and chafe at US dominance, but it is also pragmatic, says Kerry Brown, director of the Lau China Institute at King's College London.

Will America's political establishment fare any better?  If there is a regnant consensus among the men and women who steer the Western world, it is this: The globe is flattening. Borders are crumbling. Identities are fluid. Commerce and communications form the warp and woof, weaving nations into the tight fabric of a global economy. People are free to pursue opportunity, enriching their new homes culturally and economically. There may be painful dislocations along the way, but the benefits of globalization heavily outweigh its costs. And those who cannot see this, those who would resist it, those who would undo it-they are ignorant of their own interests, bigoted, xenophobic, and backward.  So entrenched is this consensus that, for decades, in most Western democracies, few mainstream political parties have thought to challenge it. They have left it to the politicians on the margins of the left and the right to give voice to such sentiments-and voicing such sentiments relegated politicians to the margins of political life.  No longer. In 2016, the consensus crumbled, torn apart by a failure of empathy, and a failure of imagination.  In Britain, Boris Johnson led the Brexit campaign to victory-and perhaps to 10 Downing Street. In the United States, Donald Trump will ride his message of \\\\\\\"America First\\\\\\\" to Cleveland-and perhaps to the White House. And they are not alone. In Austria, Norbert Hofer advanced to the threshold of the Hofburg Palace. In Hungary, polls show growing support for the far-right Jobbik party. Across the Western world, populist ethno-nationalism is rising, and unscrupulous politicians have spotted the opportunity, and are eagerly riding it to power.  To oppose it, political elites turned to fear. They compared Trump to Hitler, Stalin, and Mussolini. They warned Brexit would plunge Britain into a black hole. They evoked the specter of Europe's bloody past. These tactics barely worked in Austria. And they narrowly failed in Britain. It is an open question whether it will succeed in the United States.  This was the failure of empathy. The economic benefits of globalization are diffuse, it turns out, and its costs highly concentrated. For the worker whose factory has shuttered, cheaper T-shirts offer scant consolation. And the costs of cultural dislocation, although more difficult to quantify, are equally real. It is no coincidence that cultural discontent increases in the U.S. and the U.K. as a direct function of age-the further removed voters feel from the culture into which they were born, the more alien they feel in their own lands. Instead of addressing the pain many voters felt, politicians spent years telling their constituents they were wrong. Not just wrong, in fact, but dangerously ignorant.  Take the Republican U.S. presidential debate in Charleston, South Carolina, early in the primary season. When Trump suggested slapping tariffs on China, his rivals pounced on his obvious error. Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, and Ted Cruz scolded Donald Trump about the dangers of protectionism, as if delivering an Econ 101 lecture to a recalcitrant child. \\\\\\\"China does not pay the tariff, the buyer pays the tariff,\\\\\\\" Rubio said. Perhaps so-but factory workers also pay the costs of free trade, and that's a much higher tab. That, somehow, went unmentioned.  Compounding this is a profound failure of imagination. Trump wants to make American great again; the Brexit campaigners promised to make Britain great again.

Just as the services were breathing a little easier with fresh money from Congress for spare parts and maintenance operations to begin to restore the readiness of their crippled aviation squadrons, the big guy issued orders to march in double time. On Tuesday, news broke that Defense Secretary Jim Mattis issued a memo last month to the Air Force and Navy departments giving them just 12 months to get 80 percent of their fighter jets fit for combat.  While no one is complaining publicly, several of the players in the tactical aviation units I talked to yesterday indicated that Mattis' tall order may be a tad unrealistic. \\\\\\\"Up to now our talking point has been that it took us years to get into this problem, it's going to take years to get out,\\\\\\\" said one officer who asked not to be identified. \\\\\\\"We are in a big hole,\\\\\\\" said another.  For example, only 53.3 percent of Navy F/A-18 Super Hornets are rated \\\\\\\"mission-capable,\\\\\\\" meaning they are fit to fly, but even they may not be combat-ready, which requires a higher rating of \\\\\\\"fully mission-capable.\\\\\\\" And only last month, the number of F/A-18s available was below 50 percent.  \\\\\\\"Those are horrific numbers, all of them,\\\\\\\" said John Venable, a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation who served 25 years in the Air Force. \\\\\\\"It's a huge lift but it is about time they got the pressure.  \\\\\\\"The laissez-faire style of leadership is gone and that left with the Obama administration and the commanders that were associated with that. They were not given the funds, they were not given the certainty they needed to lead their forces. Well, now there is no excuses. These guys have the money, they have the personnel, they have the machinery,\\\\\\\" Venable said.  LEARN FROM THE PROS: The Mattis memo orders the services to bring mission-capable rates for their F-35, F-22, F-16 and F/A-18 fleet above 80 percent by Oct. 15 of next year. \\\\\\\"I am just not sure that's possible,\\\\\\\" lamented one aviation officer. Mattis directed the services to take a page out of the private-sector playbook, and use the best practices of commercial aviation companies to improve readiness quickly. \\\\\\\"I am confident in our Department's ability to generate additional capacity from our current aircraft inventory, alongside the commercial aviation industry's sustainment of high availability rates,\\\\\\\" Mattis wrote in the Sept. 17 memo.  The Senate Armed Services Committee drilled down on the commercial industry's example during testimony by Air Force leaders on Wednesday. \\\\\\\"I did a little sniffing around, I think Delta Airlines, their aircraft readiness in their fleet is about 86 percent.

The stunt looked promising as Johnson took off down the line, waving two U.K. flags.

Safe Harbour has already been deemed invalid, and frantic talks have been underway to finalize its successor.  Despite gaining the backing of Microsoft, EU-US Privacy Shield has faced a great deal of criticism. In the wake of the Brexit vote in the UK referendum on EU membership, the UK may be forced to comply with the rules even though it is in the process of exiting the Union. One of the most significant changes to come about -- and one that will be welcomed by privacy advocates -- is a promise from the White House not to engage in indiscriminate bulk data collection of European data.  Assuming there is agreement by EU member states, the EU-US Privacy Shield agreement could come into force in July. The promise from the US is likely to have a positive impact on the agreement's reception. In a written agreement, the White House says that it will not engage in NSA-style bulk data collection of data transferred between the EU and the US, apart from under specific conditions, and even then only in a \\\\\\\" targeted and focused\\\\\\\" manner.  Other changes include a requirement for companies to delete retained data when it no longer serves the purpose for which it was collected. In addition to this, the US ombudsman that is due to be set up to oversee complaints will have to be completely independent of national security services.  But the full impact of the Brexit vote is yet to sink in. A spokesperson for the Information Commissioner's office said:  If the UK wants to trade with the single market on equal terms we would have to prove 'adequacy' - in other words, UK data protection standards would have to be equivalent to the EU's General Data Protection Regulation framework starting in 2018. With so many businesses and services operating across borders, international consistency around data protection laws and rights is crucial both to businesses and organizations and to consumers and citizens.  This means that despite having voted to step away from EU regulations, the UK may have no option but to bow to them anyway.

{"instruction": "Extract attitudes between entities and topics from the article in JSON format and categorize them [Positive, Neutral, Negative] and justify them quoting the article", "input": "PHOTO: Remain supporters face the result of Britain's European Union referendum early Friday morning  Nine experts from the University of Birmingham - most of whom made eve-of-referendum videos assessing the issues - follow up with an assessment of the Brexit verdict and what comes next.  Originally published by the Birmingham Perspective:  See EA's full Britain and Europe coverage  Jenny Phillimore: Anti-Immigration Sentiment v. Immigration Realities  A devastating result and a dark day for Britain. It seems that a small majority of the British (or should I say English and Welsh) electorate were convinced by the hateful and, frankly, dishonest Leave campaign. The economic, political, social, and cultural consequences will be with us for decades impacting on our children and grandchildren.  Anti-immigration sentiment appears to have driven this result. Yet even the Leave campaign refused to promise that Brexit will deliver in terms of reducing net immigration, and one of the few points they conceded was that Britain's economy depends on migrants.  With a minimum of two years until we formally break with Europe, the inevitable turbulence in our economy may well be coupled with a spike in immigration as those contemplating coming to Britain take their last chance to do so. Meanwhile the three million EU citizens who reside amongst us - many doing the dirty, dangerous and difficult jobs that we do not want, others contributing their skills and knowledge - will feel increasingly disenfranchised with this result perceived as a rejection of them and all they have offered us.  Tim Haughton: The Effective Myth of \\\\\\\"Take Back Control\\\\\\\"  The reason why the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union can be expressed in three words: \\\\\\\"Take Back Control\\\\\\\". The Leave side used the alluring slogan repeatedly and relentlessly, whereas the Remain side never coined a simple and effective slogan.  Leave's slogan was vague and often masked an inaccurate description of decision-making in the EU. But in political campaigns what matters is not what is accurate, but what works.  \\\\\\\"Take back control\\\\\\\" combined a sense of a positive future ,albeit never defined or elaborated, with a sense of rightful ownership. Moreover, it helped to mobilize the anti-establishment support of voters who felt let down by their politicians.  The Brexit referendum, as referenda are so often, was only driven in part by the question on the ballot paper. Frustrated by the sense that the political class had failed them, many ordinary citizens took the opportunity to vent their fury.  Fiona de Londras: The Challenge of Forthcoming Negotiations  Once triggered, Article 50 will usher in up to two years of negotiation resulting in Brexit and a treaty on the UK's future relationship with the European Union  These negotiations are complex. The UK will have to determine what it wants; this will require domestic political leadership and clarity that is not currently in evidence. Furthermore, every member state will have to determine its priorities and bring these together in a common EU vision. In this, weighted votes will be used so that more powerful states have a louder voice than smaller states, although in practice consensus is preferred.  If the Treaty goes beyond matters of trade (which it likely will), it will have to be ratified by every other member state before finalisation. The European Parliament also has a veto option.

Huw Macartney: Shock and Decline  This will certainly be a Black Friday for sterling and global financial markets. The real issue is the longer-term decline that will follow the immediate shock.  Even the Brexit campaigners admitted that Exit would inevitably be painful in the \\\\\\\"short term\\\\\\\". Aside from the blame tactics, against Europe and immigrants, used by the Brexiteers though, there was also a promise of hope.  Yet we have already seen the effect that the Referendum uncertainty had on investment and the economic recovery in the first half of 2016. And so as that uncertainty continues, almost certainly for more than the two year renegotiation period, recession will lead to further job losses and welfare cuts and that hope will quickly evaporate.  Experts predicted this, but we were told that we did not need experts. But the reality is that the Leave voters were not told how bad things are going to get (for them).  And as that reality starts to bite, the politics of hate, targeting immigrants and the politics of austerity, targeting the poor, will only increase. If we think Britain looks divided now, I fear that our condition is only going to deteriorate.  Scott Lucas: \\\\\\\"God Help Our Country\\\\\\\"  The former leader of the Liberal Democrats, Paddy Ashdown, captured the moment in four words after the BBC declared victory for the Leave campaign in Britain's EU referendum:  God help our country.

There are lots of things we do not know yet. Here are some that we do:  What will not happen is \\\\u00a3350 million a week more for the NHS. Even the UK Independence party leader Nigel Farage said, soon after the result was announced, that it was \\\\\\\"a mistake\\\\\\\" to make that claim. The NHS faces intense financial pressures and the best way to address those pressures is through a growing economy and increased tax revenues. The financial uncertainties introduced by the Leave vote look very unlikely to generate that growth, in the short-term at least.

However, people opposed to NHS marketization would be na\\\\u00efve to see this as an EU-led agenda, when so much of the opening up of the NHS to market competition has come from the policies of recent Westminster governments.

Anthony Arnull: The Burden of Black Friday  A question near the top of the Government's agenda, following the vote to leave the EU, will be when to inform the Union that the UK intends to withdraw.

Sotirios Zartaloudis: Far-Right Populism  This result confirms what we have been witnessing in England over the last ten years, a steady rise of far-right extremism and populism. Using a \\\\\\\"scapegoat\\\\\\\" agenda and promoting the Euro-racism of \\\\\\\"the decent people\\\\\\\" - Nigel Farage's phrase - against \\\\\\\"Europeans\\\\\\\" in Brussels and in the UK, Britain becomes the first country to decide to leave the EU.  Parts of Britain have been out of Europe mentally for some years now. But the worst is yet to come. Brexiteers have a clear agenda of dismantling key aspects of employment law legislation, environmental protection, and other market-correcting regulations.  Today most British voters feel closer to the angry supporters of Donald Trump, where far-right populism is used strategically by rich elites who accuse foreigners and \\\\\\\"experts\\\\\\\" of being the key culprits responsible for increasing economic precariousness. One wonders if they will ever realize that this is a convenient excuse used by Westminster to shift the blame elsewhere.  This is an own-goal of historic proportions that gives pleasure to far-right populists around the world, such as Vladimir Putin and Marine LePen). It may signify the dismantling of the UK, given the strong pro-EU voting in Scotland, Northern Ireland, and London.  David Dunn: The Place of England-Wales in the World  Although foreign and security issues were not central to the referendum debate, the impact of Brexit may be momentous. Brexit has the potential to re-energize the Irish question and Scottish support for Europe presages a second independence referendum - one which has implications for the UK's nuclear status given that these forces are all based on the Clyde.  \\\\\\\"Taking back control\\\\\\\" of trade policy will also affect England's foreign policy. In seeking deals with China, the Middle East, and beyond, the Foreign Office will be less inclined to side with its major allies in criticizing these states when its bilateral trade access depends upon accommodation. This may create distance from Washington, Berlin, and Paris as London kowtows to Bejing and others for market access.  The biggest impact, however, will be on Europe itself. President Obama's support for Remain was premised on the idea that an outward looking, Atlanticist Europe was better for the world and more likely with the UK in it. Following Brexit, the forces of disintegration and xenophobia have been strengthened in Europe and the progress made over the last 70 years towards a tolerant, integrated, and liberal political community has been put at risk.  The consequences for the very nature of Europe have been raised by Brexit and go way beyond the uncertainty over what relations England-Wales will have with the continent and the rest of the world.", "output": "\"{\\n  \\\"topical_attitudes\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"source\\\": {\\\"entity\\\": \\\"Sotirios Zartaloudis\\\", \\\"references\\\": [\\\"Sotirios Zartaloudis\\\"]},\\n      \\\"target\\\": {\\\"topic\\\": \\\"Brexit\\\", \\\"references\\\": [\\\"Brexit\\\"]},\\n      \\\"justifications\\\": [\\\"This result confirms what we have been witnessing in England over the last ten years, a steady rise of far-right extremism and populism.\\\", \\\"Brexiteers have a clear agenda of dismantling key aspects of employment law legislation, environmental protection, and other market-correcting regulations.\\\"],\\n      \\\"attitude\\\": \\\"Negative\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"source\\\": {\\\"entity\\\": \\\"David Dunn\\\", \\\"references\\\": [\\\"David Dunn\\\"]},\\n      \\\"target\\\": {\\\"topic\\\": \\\"Brexit\\\", \\\"references\\\": [\\\"Brexit\\\"]},\\n      \\\"justifications\\\": [\\\"Although foreign and security issues were not central to the referendum debate, the impact of Brexit may be momentous.\\\", \\\"Brexit has the potential to re-energize the Irish question and Scottish support for Europe presages a second independence referendum.\\\"]\\n      \\\"attitude\\\": \\\"Neutral\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"source\\\": {\\\"entity\\\": \\\"David Dunn\\\", \\\"references\\\": [\\\"David Dunn\\\"]},\\n      \\\"target\\\": {\\\"topic\\\": \\\"EU disintegration\\\", \\\"references\\\": [\\\"forces of disintegration and xenophobia in Europe\\\"]},\\n      \\\"justifications\\\": [\\\"Following Brexit, the forces of disintegration and xenophobia have been strengthened in Europe.\\\"]\\n      \\\"attitude\\\": \\\"Negative\\\"\\n    }\\n  ],\\n  \\\"entity_attitudes\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"entity1\\\": {\\\"entity\\\": \\\"Sotirios Zartaloudis\\\", \\\"references\\\": [\\\"Sotirios Zartaloudis\\\"]},\\n      \\\"entity2\\\": {\\\"entity\\\": \\\"Nigel Farage\\\", \\\"references\\\": [\\\"Nigel Farage\\\"]},\\n      \\\"justifications\\\": [\\\"Using a \\\\\\\"scapegoat\\\\\\\" agenda and promoting the Euro-racism of \\\\\\\"the decent people\\\\\\\" -

Populist leaders have now urged similar referendums in their own countries as the one that led to Britain's Brexit on Thursday.  Listen to Stefan Bos' report:      With the British pound declining and shares plunging in Europe, the United States and other markets, government leaders wonder who else may leave the European Union after Britain. If it's up to populist leaders, Brexit is the beginning of the unraveling of the EU.  Dutch firebrand politician Geert Wilders who leads the anti-Islam PVV party told Vatican Radio that he wants a similar 'Nexit' vote in the Netherlands. \\\\\\\"It's a historic day. The people of Britain have been teaching the elite in London and Brussels a lesson,\\\\\\\" he said.  \\\\\\\"They choose for an independent Britain that can take care of its own affairs, its own borders its own migration policy and money. And I hope and think that the Netherlands should do the same.\\\\\\\"  His comments worry governments in Eastern Europe as his party is leading in opinion polls in the Netherlands ahead of upcoming elections. Hungary, Czech Republic, Poland and Slovakia, known as the Visegrad Group view Brexit as a major loss for the EU.  EU subsidies  They are heavily dependent on billions of euros in EU subsidies and fear for the future of the many East Europeans working in Britain. Slovakia, which take over the EU's rotating presidency on July 1, has already urged Britain to say when it will leave in an effort to end the uncertainty.  Poland, the largest economy among East Europe's EU member states, is worried too. Poland's Foreign Minister Witold Waszczkowski said Brexit would lead to \\\\\\\"problems, problems for both Great Britain and for Poland. Problems, troubles, chaos, long chronic negotiations.\\\\\\\"  In Western Europe, French President Francois Hollande warned: \\\\\\\"The danger of extremism and populism is immense. It's always quicker to undo than to create. To destroy than to build. France, founding member of the EU, will not accept it.\\\\\\\"  The United States also expressed concern. And shock waves are felt in Brussels where the president of the European Council, Donald Tusk, tried to calm down his worried colleagues. \\\\\\\"I always remember what my father used to tell me: 'what does not kill you, makes you stronger'.\\\\\\\"  Yet for now the uncertainty continues over the future of the EU, once founded after World War Two to avoid new conflicts in Europe.

And although leaders of the campaign to exit Europe are crowing over their victory, it seems many Britons may not even know what they had actually voted for.  Awakening to a stock market plunge and a precipitous decline in the value of the pound that Britain has not seen in more than 30 years, voters now face a series of economic shocks that analysts say will only worsen before they improve. The consequences of the leave vote will be felt worldwide, even in the United States, and some British voters say they now regret casting a ballot in favour of Brexit.  \\\\\\\"Even though I voted to leave, this morning I woke up and I just - the reality did actually hit me,\\\\\\\" one woman told the news channel ITV News. \\\\\\\"If I'd had the opportunity to vote again, it would be to stay.\\\\\\\"  That confusion over what Brexit might mean for the country's economy appears to have been reflected across the United Kingdom on Thursday.

Eastern time, about eight hours after the polls closed, Google reported that searches for \\\\\\\"what happens if we leave the EU\\\\\\\" had more than tripled.  The run-up to the vote was marked by a bitterly divided campaign, one that was as much about immigration fears as it was about the global economy.

What, for example, are the terms of BrExit exit?  And how will they be agreed?  Brookings Fellow Tom Wright asks, \\\\\\\"If it is right and proper for the people to have a say on EU membership, should not they also have a say on the outcome of the negotiations to determine whether they are what the Leave campaign promised?\\\\\\\"  What terms should Northern Ireland's leaders now be seeking?  Simple: Northern Ireland must stay within the EU and the UK.  Northern Ireland and Scotland can and must make common cause on this objective immediately.  The nature of the U.K. demands change in order to be saved.  For Scottish nationalists, this represents the smart play.  The SNP, even now, can not be complacent about winning a second Scottish independence referendum - should they secure one. But a Scotland that shares a union with Europe, while remaining within a looser U.K., is one that can be remake on solid foundations; Uniquely Scottish but anchored in the realities of local and international interdependence, not fantasies about standing alone in the modern world.  For English Nationalists - and that's clearly what the BrExiters overwhelmingly are - well, they have asked for this.  Having demanded and won \\\\\\\"national\\\\\\\" independence and the end of a union that supposedly impeded and diluted it, will they dare deny the Scottish people the same right?  And what about the Irish, north and south, green and orange?  To most people living in Northern Ireland not named Arlene Foster and Martin McGuiness, like those studying its conflict from afar, it's long been clear that the only \\\\\\\"solution\\\\\\\" would be some sort of rolling constitutional fudge.  Since \\\\\\\"constitutional fudge\\\\\\\" has been the trending Google search in civil service departments across the capitals of Europe since June 24th, today all of Ireland is presented with a unique opportunity amid the chaos.  Northern Ireland's future has always required a grey area between London and Dublin where both identities can coexist.  As with post-BrExit Scotland, a Northern Ireland that shares European Union membership with the Republic of Ireland, and a union with the rest of the U.K., makes sense.  This is not the independent stand-alone Irish Republic envisioned by De Valera. No, this would be much more sensible and sustainable and than that fantasy.  This would be a stronger Ireland than ever.  An island without an internal border; two cooperative political entities sharing a outward face to the world, part-British, part-Irish, entirely European.  Pre-BrExit, Belfast's hardline British Democratic Unionist party has championed the adoption of a corporate tax rate in harmony not with London but Dublin. Post-BrExit, the logic of this position makes the case for Belfast remaining in the U.K and in the E.U., especially if the north's Scottish cousins lead the way.  For Belfast's Irish nationalists, the opportunity is greater still. Since 1998's Belfast Agreement, they have been in search of a question to answer and a problem to solve.  The once strong SDLP spent years arguing that \\\\\\\"north south makes sense\\\\\\\" but failing to explain why, or even what that meant.  Post-BrExit, it's abundantly clear that a hard land border between Northern Ireland and the world's largest trading bloc in the world is utterly senseless. It's also rather dangerous.  BrExit has changed everything. But the terms of that change are up for grabs.  We can not go backwards but for Northern Ireland, the past is best left there anyway.

If I'd had the opportunity to vote again, it would be to stay.\\\\\\\"  The obvious point to make about the spike in search terms is that the entire British populace, from both the Remain and Leave camps, were wondering about the implications, hence feeding the figures in post-electoral agitation.  But the sting in the tail of the Post piece was the condescension. Britons may well have been \\\\\\\"mystified\\\\\\\" by what would happen in an exit scenario, but \\\\\\\"many seemed not even to know what the European Union is.\\\\\\\"  Within, and without Britain, Europe is fracturing. Over thirty three million people expressed their views. Within Britain, the votes went along lines of disunion. A silent Britain, one hidden from the political discussion, roared its disapproval. Scotland went to remain; Wales did not. Northern Ireland, in wishing to remain, will be seeking options for closer collaboration with the Republic of Ireland.  All of these consequences may now be seen as disastrous, when they should be viewed as the logical manifestation of a people's will. Dislike it, but never rubbish it. That is a tyrant's prerogative, an instinctive response in refusing to reform. Gatekeepers of the European project will do at their peril.

The BBC relayed the results live, color-coding the decisions on a map of the UK. Yellow for Remain, blue for Leave. As district after district announced its decision to Leave the European Union, the map slowly turned blue.  As dawn broke, the leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP), Nigel Farage, claimed victory. \\\\\\\"This is a victory for real people, a victory for ordinary people, a victory for decent people. We fought against the multinationals, the merchant bankers and big politics\\\\\\\", he said. \\\\\\\"Let June 23rd go down in history as our Independence Day\\\\\\\".  But the truth is very different. This was not a victory for \\\\\\\"real people\\\\\\\" against \\\\\\\"the establishment\\\\\\\". Nor was it an angry British population lashing out against its oppressors. No, the truth is that this was a victory of some groups of British people over other groups. It was a victory of the old over the young: rural and coastal dwellers over city dwellers: the old industrial heartlands over the upstart London: England over Scotland. Brexit has revealed deep rifts in the social fabric of the UK. The referendum ripped the sticking plaster off the gaping wounds that are the legacy of the Thatcher years. The United Kingdom can no longer claim to be united.  The cracks were already showing long before the referendum. UKIP had been growing in popularity for several years, particularly in coastal and rural areas where concern over immigration and anger at the EU's many policy failures are at their highest. The area where I live, Rochester & Strood, briefly elected a UKIP member of Parliament in a high-profile by-election, though we threw him out at the General Election six months later. UKIP supporters were easily recognizable: middle-aged and elderly working-class men, the kind who sit drinking beer in the Working Men's Club in Strood and moan about immigration, bankers, employers and - above all - the EU. Older women, too, who chat in the supermarkets about the cost of living and how they can not get appointments at the local health center because of the immigrants. The referendum gave these people a chance to go beyond merely complaining that \\\\\\\"Britain is going to the dogs\\\\\\\". For once, they could act to change it. And they did.  The EU is their scapegoat, a proxy for everything that they hate. Petty laws telling them what they can and can not do, such as the EU's recent decision to control e-cigarettes. Taxes, particularly the hated Value Added Tax (VAT): most recently, what was seen as the EU's imposition of VAT on women's sanitary products helped to fuel the Brexit campaign. And above all, immigrants. Immigrants from Eastern Europe coming here because of the EU's free movement of people policy, taking our jobs, undercutting our wages, living in our houses, sending their children to our schools, clogging up the health service. Refugees from the Middle East coming here because the EU can not control its borders, threatening our security and ruining our culture.  Much of this is misinformation peddled through sections of the UK's media. The Economist says that the Daily Mail, Daily Express and Telegraph routinely misreport \\\\\\\"facts\\\\\\\" about the EU. The European Commission's website routinely debunks myths, at times trenchantly. Quality UK media do so too, as do EU-friendly UK politicians. But it is all to avail. The EU is the enemy, and nothing it says can be believed. Those who in any way support it are tainted too.

But for young people who have only known the UK in the EU, it is meaningless. For them, the EU's open borders are a boon, not a bane: they can work and study anywhere in Europe. They see government policy, not immigration, as the primary cause of low wages and pressure on local services. And although they may be angry about tax, they see that too as primarily due to government policy, not the EU. Perhaps most fundamentally of all, they see themselves as British Europeans, not simply as British. Their anger is aimed much more at \\\\\\\"baby boomers\\\\\\\", whom they believe had security, prosperity and opportunity that is being denied to them. This is as distorted a view as that of the older people who say \\\\\\\"young people today\\\\\\\" are feckless, lazy and/or thick. But it reinforces the sense of alienation. And Brexit makes this much, much worse.  Older people voted for Brexit: the older they were, the more likely they were to vote to leave. Young people, especially those aged 18-25, voted overwhelmingly to remain in the EU. They are understandably furious with older people about the result. But in last year's General Election, only 43% of that age group bothered to vote, compared with 78% of over-65s. The same may well have been true in the referendum. My 18-year-old daughter (who did vote) complained that her friends would discuss the referendum on social media, but they would not vote. Young people feel disenfranchised, but their own behavior reinforces this. Brexit is to some extent a reflection of the disengagement of young people from the political process.  And it is also a reflection of the growing fragmentation of the UK. The BBC's map of England and Wales turned blue: but Scotland and Northern Ireland turned yellow. Scotland, in particular, voted overwhelmingly to remain in the EU. This will reinforce calls for a second independence referendum in Scotland. It may also reignite the campaign for reunification of Northern Ireland with its southern neighbor, Ireland, which has no plans to leave the EU.  Nor do the fault lines run only between the countries that make up the UK. England, by far the largest of the four, is also deeply split, with the industrial \\\\\\\"heartlands\\\\\\\" voting to Leave but London voting to Remain. This reflects long-term dissatisfaction with the direction of the UK economy. The UK is a service economy, and the cosmopolitan, services-dominated London is the heart of it. Heavy manufacturing industries and mining, especially in the Midlands and North of England, were systematically trashed in the 1980s and have never really recovered. Older people there, who remember the glory days of industrial strength and dream of its return, are angry at the success of the upstart London - especially as they believe they paid for its bailout in 2008. They see themselves as the \\\\\\\"real people\\\\\\\", and London as a \\\\\\\"bubble\\\\\\\" dominated by bankers and politicians.  London may respond to this antagonism in a way they do not expect. It is, after all, one of the biggest and most prosperous cities in the world, with a larger population than the whole of Scotland. There are already suggestions that if Scotland could go it alone, so too could London. \\\\\\\"The idea of London and Scotland becoming free trade zones has to be explored\\\\\\\", said Anthony Painter of the London-based Royal Society of Arts in a tweet. \\\\\\\"The UK is no longer a single political entity\\\\\\\".

Google saw a huge increase in the number of people searching for 'immigration to Australia' after the shock announcement that the majority of Britons voted to leave the EU, (51.9 per cent compared to 48.1 per cent wanting to stay).  While politicians call for stability amid economic turmoil, many Brits are seeing the prospect of living Down Under as a positive alternative.  \\\\\\\"The grass does look greener on the other side at the moment,\\\\\\\" Professor Glenn Withers, an Immigration expert from Australian National University told Mail Online. \\\\\\\"The disdain in the UK has driven people to think about other options.\\\\\\\"  According to Google Analytics data, the number of times people looked for migration to Australia soared in the lead up to the referendum. It peaked at 6.30pm AEST on Friday, when it was announced that Leave was on its way to victory after gaining large margins across northern England and Wales.  Professor Withers said British nationals were still eligible to apply to migrate to Australia despite the Brexit decision and would enhance Australia's economy.  \\\\\\\"The Brits have traditionally settled well here and in uncertain times a steady flow of immigrants would keep the economy growing.\\\\\\\"  It would be an ironic swipe to Boris Johnson who wants to take back control of our borders if people left the UK for Australia and also after he campaigned that he wanted to make it easier for non-EU migrants to study and work in the UK if it left the EU.

Global stocks tanked, and the British pound crashed to a 31-year low. World leaders from the U.S. to Japan to Germany spoke out about the far-reaching effects the referendum would have.  The scale of this reaction was predictable - after all, the U.K. joined the EU's predecessor, the EEC (European Economic Community), back in 1973 and has been one of its most influential members for decades. As the (now formerly!) fifth-largest economy in the world, even moderate changes in Britain's political stance affect global markets.  So why did the U.K. vote for something so politically and economically disruptive? Some say race has a lot to do with it - specifically, the racial tension that has resulted from the U.K.'s recently welcoming in record numbers of immigrants. In 2015, 630,000 foreign national migrants came to the U.K. from both inside and outside the EU. This year, the U.K. has ushered in an additional 333,000.  The campaign to get the U.K. to leave the EU (also known as the \\\\\\\"Leave\\\\\\\" campaign) was spearheaded by the right-wing, populist UK Independence Party, or UKIP. The party, led by Member in the European Parliament Nigel Farage, says that the EU \\\\\\\"means the end of the UK as an independent, self-governing nation with its own government and its own borders.\\\\\\\"  For months, UKIP has fought for the United Kingdom's independence from the EU - some say by capitalizing on racially charged animus toward immigrants.

Beauchamp says, \\\\\\\"Over the course of the past 20 years, the percentage of Britons ranking 'immigration/race relations' as among the country's most important issues has gone from near zero percent to about 45 percent. Seventy-seven percent of Brits today believe that immigration levels should be reduced.\\\\\\\"  Many politicians say anti-immigration sentiment should not necessarily be cast as racism - they argue that immigrants take jobs from native-born British citizens, that immigration drives down wages for everyone, and that the desire to keep jobs abundant and wages high is a goal that millions share, across racial and political lines.

Still, concern about the rate of immigration is central to Lee's list.  But James Bloodworth, writing for International Business Times, says the issue can not be explained in purely economic terms. Even as the number of migrants arriving in the U.K. rose to a record 333,000 in May of this year, immigrants have been an overall boon to the British economy. Bloodworth explains:  \\\\\\\"Hostility to immigration - and by extension hostility to Europe - is driven by cultural concerns as much as by economic worries. That's certainly what the University of Oxford's Migration Observatory has been saying in recent years. It has pointed out on a number of occasions that cultural concerns better explain negative attitudes towards migration than a person's economic position. In essence it is about whether England feels like England.\\\\\\\"  J.K. Rowling, author of the Harry Potter series, cautions against casting everyone who backed the Leave movement as a bigot but also writes about the danger of painting immigrants as monsters and villains:  \\\\\\\"Leave has been busy threatening us with another monster: a tsunami of faceless foreigners heading for our shores, among them rapists and terrorists.\\\\\\\"It is dishonourable to suggest, as many have, that Leavers are all racists and bigots: they are not and it is shameful to suggest that they are. Nevertheless, it is equally nonsensical to pretend that racists and bigots are not flocking to the 'Leave' cause, or that they are not, in some instances, directing it. For some of us, that fact alone is enough to give us pause. The picture of Nigel Farage standing in front of a poster showing a winding line of Syrian refugees captioned 'Breaking Point' is, as countless people have already pointed out, an almost exact duplicate of propaganda used by the Nazis.\\\\\\\"  Some British politicians are trying to soften the blow. Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, wrote a message on his Facebook page telling EU residents living in London that they are welcome and that the city is grateful for them.  Lauren Hansen, a writer at The Week, wrote, \\\\\\\"Mayor Khan's comments are especially poignant in this post-Brexit world as the continent's largest city grapples with the tension between an anti-immigration sentiment and the diversity that makes London, and cities like it, thrive both economically and culturally.\\\\\\\"  Of course, it would be remiss not to mention the parallels that many are drawing between the Brexit movement and Donald Trump's campaign rhetoric.

Trump has presented a nightmarish vision of America overrun by Mexican felons and Muslim terrorists.

We find ourselves in a moment of global fear. The democratic identities of Britain and the United States are under threat - not from immigrants or even changing values, but from nationalists and xenophobes exploiting citizens' darkest worries with populist projects, including Donald Trump's campaign for the U.S. presidency and Brexit.

Unsurprisingly, politicians of many stripes are capitalizing on our fears to rally voters against trade, immigration and international cooperation. The costs will be substantial. Economists, business leaders and scholars almost universally agree that Britain's retreat from the EU is a self-inflicted economic blunder.

Politically the country is in limbo recovering from the flimflam of an ill-informed, divisive referendum campaign that one commentator described as voters being \\\\\\\"deceived by the Pied Pipers of Brexit.\\\\\\\" It has a weak caretaker government pending a replacement for Prime Minister David Cameron. The vote has effectively ripped up not just its mandate but shredded its foreign and economic policies.  The UK no longer has a clue as to what its position is in Europe let alone its role on the global stage. The thorny issue of immigration is not resolved and nor is there any evident incoming strategy. Outsiders can be forgiven for fearing a nastier, less friendly Britain ill at ease with a globalised world.  For the UK's foreign policy, this is dramatic with significant implications for the Middle East. This year marks the 100th anniversary of the Sykes-Picot agreement, when the UK was carving up the Middle East with France. The disastrous mandate eras, the Second World War and the Suez crisis put paid to the British empire, and by 1971 Britain withdrew from the Gulf and Aden. Since then, Britain's Middle East policy (typically a series of contrary positions) was shaped firstly by its ties to its successor superpower in the Middle East, the United States, and secondly, particularly from the 1990s onwards, the European Union. British Middle East policy was therefore framed by relations with these two powers, and in the European case, largely with France and Germany.  Add into the mix the uncertainty across the Atlantic. A Clinton presidency may offer a degree of normalcy in Anglo-US relations but it will not just be Britain which would struggle with a President Trump. Who would want to be seen as Trump's poodle in the Middle East given his anti-Muslim bigotry and his position to ban all Muslims entering the United States? (In a recent poll only 3.8 percent of Egyptians and 6 percent of Saudis backed Trump over Clinton). Britain may suspend its unofficial status as the 51st state. (Remember also that the favourite to replace Cameron, Boris Johnson said last December that \\\\\\\"The only reason I would not visit some parts of New York is the real risk of meeting Donald Trump.\\\\\\\")  Britain is not about to fashion a new freelance, foreign policy quite yet. In years to come, unshackled by the EU collective position, it may develop a nimbler, more fleet-footed approach. For example, Britain like Norway might be able to open channels to Hamas and Hezbollah to probe possibilities for resolving conflict.  But for now, its relations with Europe will become a key domestic policy issue, and beyond that, it is tough to imagine Britain will have time or resources for any new global initiatives at all. Only the most reckless of prime ministers would embark for example on a new war in the Middle East with this uncertainty enshrouding his country. Then again, British politics has become disturbingly unpredictable.  Given then that a future prime minister and foreign secretary will be otherwise engaged, what can the Middle East expect?  Sense might suggest a business-as-usual approach with nothing too radical. Britain will be anxious to reassure long-term allies not least in the Gulf that firstly, they will not be abandoned but secondly that the UK should remain a destination of choice for them and their investments.

It can no longer hide behind EU statements for this and needs friends not enemies. Worse, it may even try to exploit any unhappiness with the EU or US. Above all there will be an obsession with obtaining new trade deals to replace those lost by exiting the EU.  For the crisis countries of Syria, Iraq, Yemen and Libya, Britain may offer little. Their urgent priority is solutions and creative thinking to usher them out of their disastrous plight. Any potential peace deals will require external assistance, and nation-building expertise. A navel-gazing inward-looking British government is not going to do that.  Turkey will lose a country that has until this Brexit campaign when the prime minister backed off, championed its accession to the EU. Britain will now have zero influence on this. Israel will lose a key voice within the EU for its interests, one that often inserted US positions into the Israel-Palestine debate in Brussels. As for Iran, an incoming British government may take a different approach to the nuclear issue.  Given the likely make-up of a pro-Brexit government is hardly going to be refugee-friendly, there will be little change on this issue. The UK had already left the refugee crisis to be managed (poorly) by the rest of the EU and will continue to wash its hands of any responsibility.  But where Britain has played a positive role is as a major aid donor. This is under threat. One of the grievances of the far right in Britain is that, rather than invest in core services at home, too much funding went on international development. Incoming ministers may wish to shrink the \\\\u00a312 billion aid budget especially if the economy dips into recession. Britain has committed \\\\u00a31.1 billion to Syria but this generosity as the second largest bilateral donor may diminish.  Another consequence of Brexit for the Middle East will be Britain's eventual absence from EU decision-making on the region. Britain has by far and away the most extensive diplomatic reach across the area, with deep historical ties. For sure, as the forthcoming Chilcot report into the 2003 Iraq will surely outline, British politicians have a very checkered record on the Middle East. But British diplomats are hugely respected across the EU. Frequently European diplomats tell me how much they value British input in Arab capitals.  What is so hard to determine and ultimately may matter most to the Middle East is just how influential Britain will be on the world stage, a stage that is fragmented and in the shadows. Much of this will depend on the leadership of future governments and the ability to shape a vibrant, outward-looking approach for a country that has just shown how inward looking it prefers to be.  - Chris Doyle is the director of Council for Arab-British Understanding.

After more than four decades of being shackled to the European Union (previously the European Economic Community), Great Britain has declared its independence.  The vote for Brexit (52 percent of Britons cast ballots to leave the EU) is a vote for sovereignty and self-determination. Britain will no longer be subject to European legislation, with Britain's Parliament retaking control. British judges will no longer be overruled by the European Court of Justice, and British businesses will be liberated from mountains of EU regulations, which have undermined economic liberty.  Indeed, Brexit will result in a bonfire of red tape, freeing the city of London and enterprises across the nation from European Union diktat. And at last, Britain is free again to negotiate its own free trade deals, a huge boost to the world's fifth largest economy.  The United States should seize upon Brexit as a tremendous opportunity to sign an historic free trade agreement with the United Kingdom-a deal that would advance prosperity on both sides of the Atlantic. Brexit will also strengthen the Anglo-American special relationship, the most important bilateral partnership in the world.  Britain outside the EU will be a stronger ally for the United States, from confronting Russian aggression in Eastern Europe to defeating the Islamist terror threat.  Britain's decision to leave the EU should be a cause for celebration here in America. Brexit embodies the very principles and ideals the American people hold dear to their hearts: self-determination, limited government, democratic accountability, and economic liberty. A truly free and powerful Great Britain is good for Europe and the United States.  As Margaret Thatcher famously declared after the liberation of the Falkland Islands by British forces in 1982: \\\\\\\"Rejoice.\\\\\\\" The Iron Lady believed firmly that Britain would be better off outside the European Union.

The topic was the future of NATO. My guests all spoke of their great admiration for the United States, even those who were troubled by the Obama administration's \\\\\\\"pivot\\\\\\\" to Asia. Ever briefly the talk was of Putin; then it gave way to my guests' strange cocktail of amusement and shock at Trump's unlikely ascent.  \\\\\\\"Americans will come to their senses,\\\\\\\" said one Asian ambassador, dressed perfectly, standing for our parting toast and echoing the fallacy that the pundit class has been bellowing all year: This absurd and insurgent Trump candidacy, surely, is one bad news cycle away from fatal. Many ambassadors also argued that the British people would see sense and stay in the EU.  Now, a new political reality unimaginable just months ago has set in overnight.  Britain voted to quit the EU, a seismic shift in geopolitical world order. Prime Minister David Cameron stood somberly the morning after to announce his departure by October.  The speculation is that the historic win, championed by non-establishment figures like Nigel Farage and the preternaturally colorful Boris Johnson, will presage a split of Scotland from Britain. Others fear the contagion of Euroscepticism could lead to other member nations severing themselves from the world's largest trading body. Maybe so. Party leaders in France, Italy and the Netherlands are wasting no time in capitalizing on this sea change to trigger similar \\\\\\\"Brexit\\\\\\\" style referendum movements in their own countries.  The enveloping irony around all of this, of course, is that Trump arrived in Scotland the day of the Brexit vote.  Trump is mired in the most turbulent period of his candidacy, his campaign sputtering, maybe run aground for good. Possibly, though, it has been revitalized by a reset of his campaign that started last weekend with the firing of his campaign manager, the pugnacious Corey Lewandowski, and culminated in Trump's brass-knuckles speech Wednesday that took aim not just at Hillary Clinton as a \\\\\\\"world class liar,\\\\\\\" but at corporate profiteering, Saudi Arabia and the Sultan of Brunei's treatment of women and the LGBT community, globalization itself-even the impish American spirit, sounding as close to Emersonian as Trump may ever possibly get.

You know the picture: working class, out-of-work disaffected men, embittered by a new world order that has seen London elect its first Muslim mayor (of all things!) and a country seemingly awash in Muslim immigrants. The Remain camp did its best to portray Leave Lilliputians as acting out their racist impulses.  It's true, Trump and the Leave campaign shared many common political themes. Leave unabashedly vowed to restore Britain's greatness and hit hard the sclerotic political establishment in Brussels. The leader of UKIP, Nigel Farage, decries the threat posed by Syrian immigrants, while Donald Trump talks about the threat posed by radical Islamic terrorism.  But if racism alone were the explanation for Trump's ascension and the rupture between Britain and the EU, how then to explain a brittle political order where multiple member countries are now openly discussing thoughts of their own break from Brussels?  \\\\\\\"I am actually an open borders kind of guy,\\\\\\\" said Kevin Hassett, a former economic adviser to President George W.

The poem also employed a mosaic of foreign and ancient languages, demanding the reader put in the work to extract the yield of the poem. Eliot's \\\\\\\"mashup\\\\\\\" of languages seemed to make a single haunting point: There is no common language in Europe, only a history of death.  Right after college, while visiting a friend on scholarship in Vienna, I found myself biking along the Danube in the fall of 1999. We were far from the city and deep into country where very few people spoke English. Our first night in Krems, we went to a heuriger for wine and cheese. I found myself talking to a married couple as they lamented that their son had moved away to get married. When I asked where he had moved, the woman said, the town beside us. The next morning, I biked to that town in under five minutes.  Drive anywhere in any country in Europe, one hundred miles in any direction, and you will find a town where locals boast that they have the best wine or the best cheese, sometimes in a radically different dialect that their neighbors two towns over. Neighbors, in the Americans sense, are often perceived as foreigners. Consider the internecine strife within Spain: the Basques in the north have staged a political and military campaign against Madrid for nearly seven decades, killing many innocents. The wealthy Catalans in the east have been flirting with secession from Madrid in recent years.  These subplots to the overarching EU drama have played out in different ways over the years. If the British are racist for leaving the EU, then so must be the Germans. The Greeks (invoking my paternal genetic heritage here for protection), challenged by endemic tax evasion and unemployment, have run up so much debt in recent years that the country is a Gordian knot of economic disaster, unlikely to be unraveled in my lifetime. The earnest tax-paying Germans have balked many times at the notion of bailing out their lazy EU brethren, who they see as free-riding.  The Greeks, like the Portuguese and poorer Eastern European countries like Lithuania, of course, were big beneficiaries of the $1.5 trillion Britain sent from its treasury annually to Brussels. In the end, those in the Leave camp found it outrageous that their hard-earned largesse was being put to use to pay for bridges in Greece rather than to fix potholes in Manchester.

The real number to fixate on: nearly 9 million people aged 16-64 were economically inactive-basically able to work but unable to find work. In the U.S., that bellwether number is even higher, with a record 94 million Americans out of the labor force in May (14 percent of the population in the UK, vs. 30 pervcent in the U.S.).  No one would argue that the job displacement is the result of \\\\\\\"radical Islamic terrorists\\\\\\\" or Syrian refugees. The culprit, broadly speaking, is globalization. Corporations can sell things more easily, in many new places, and can elect to manufacture goods wherever its most cost-advantageous. Where one economist will call this \\\\\\\"liberalization,\\\\\\\" political candidates, like Trump and Sanders, are calling this a rapacious hollowing out of the American manufacturing base.  The United States and Great Britain are among the wealthiest countries on the planet. That prosperity should underpin stability. Why then the tempestuous tectonic political shifts within each country? The Brexit and its origins will be studied for decades; Trump's rise, if it is still being taken seriously after a horrendous few weeks of campaigning, will only be viewed as a rebuke of the system if he manages to translate his iconoclasm into a viable political bloc beyond November. Nietzsche argued that mankind needed \\\\\\\"fixed horizons\\\\\\\" to live comfortably.

Days after ousting Lewandowski, Trump delivered the biggest speech of his campaign at his hotel in New York. Full of the usual bluster, Trump's speech was chock full of the red meat that Hillary opponents had been waiting for. Trump's use of the teleprompter was notable, as was his restrained cadence. It gave the speech an entirely different look and feel as a result. One passage, toward the end, stood out for me:  They will have a chance to vote for a new agenda with big dreams, bold ideas and enormous possibilities for the American people. Hillary Clinton's message is old and tired. Her message is that things can not change. My message is that things have to change - and this is our one chance do it. This is our last chance to do it. Americans are the people that tamed the West, that dug out the Panama Canal, that sent satellites across the solar system, that built the great dams, and so much more. Then we started thinking small. We stopped believing in what America could do, and became reliant on other countries, other people, and other institutions. We lost our sense of purpose, and daring.

Except that Trump is not a bard, he is a construction guy, first and foremost, as he himself readily admits. And no one argues that America's infrastructure is not crumbling. Even the opening of Trump's speech, a full-throated rant against corporate globalism, is a rhetorical Mobius strip that runs right into Bernie Sanders:  That's why we are asking Bernie Sanders' voters to join our movement: so together we can fix the system for ALL Americans. Importantly, this includes fixing all of our many disastrous trade deals. Because it's not just the political system that's rigged. It's the whole economy. It's rigged by big donors who want to keep down wages. It's rigged by big businesses who want to leave our country, fire our workers, and sell their products back into the U.S. with absolutely no consequences for them. It's rigged by bureaucrats who are trapping kids in failing schools. It's rigged against you, the American people.  Throughout his campaign, Trump's rhetoric has been vilified as racist, sexist, nativist and populist, depending upon the audience and the crisis. Reductive explanations are always problematic in that they ignore previous historical forces in play when technology, shifts in demographics, wealth disparity and immigration have given rise to similar \\\\\\\"movements\\\\\\\" of leaders with nativist tones.  Recently, two scholars from Oxford University, Ian Goldin and Chris Kutarna, published an audacious text about the lessons that could be drawn from the dislocation and demographic shifts that occurred during the Renaissance, a period of rapid advancement much like our own today. They argue the upheaval at the time due to technology led to a politics whose complexion is very similar to ours today.  \\\\\\\"Now, like then, new media have democratized information exchange, amplifying voices of those who feel they have been injured in the upheaval, said Goldin. In a column by Thomas Friedman, who reviews the book, he goes on to show how this turbulence led to the rise of an obscure firebrand friar, Girolamo Savonarola. He quotes Goldin as writing that \\\\\\\"he and his zealous supporters, though a small minority, swept away the Medici establishment and seized control of the city's councils.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"From there,\\\\\\\" the article continues, \\\\\\\"Savonarola launched an ugly campaign of public purification, introducing radical laws including laws against homosexuality, and attacked public intellectuals in an act of intimidation that history still remembers as the Bonfire of the Vanities. Savonarola was amongst the first to tap into the information revolution of the time, and while others produced long sermons and treatises, Savonarola disseminated short pamphlets, in what may be thought of as the equivalent of political tweets.\\\\\\\"  Trump, like the Brexiters, has been an American Savanorola throughout his unorthodox campaign, smashing the idols of party structure, ruling class and fixed horizons. Whatever one thinks of Trump, you have to acknowledge that he is better at masterminding his own narrative than the rest of the world appears willing to give him credit for.  This poses dangers for America. While the global elite stare aghast at the steamy ruins of its grand EU experiment, it will have to take more seriously the prospect of a Trump presidency.

And what of his infamous wall?  In America, the views on admitting Syrian refugees and welcoming more illegal Mexicans come down to those who view immigration as culturally additive versus those who see such an influx as a dilutive hazard to Western culture and safety. For the former, their case is a simple one to make on humanitarian and religious grounds; although the embrace of dislocated peoples obscures the metadebate that should be taking place and occupying the political discourse.

Lumineau said he would move to Paris from London and take about 10 employees at his financial startup with him.  The looming question Friday was how many other executives might reach the same conclusion, undermining Britain's status as the No. 1 destination in Europe for foreign investment.  Lumineau's reasoning was simple. His customers operate under European rules and so must he. \\\\\\\"We need to be inside,\\\\\\\" said Lumineau, the French chief executive of BrickVest, a company that allows customers to invest small sums in real estate online.  The long-term business consequences of Brexit will take years to fully emerge, largely because no one knows what kind of new trade barriers and regulations will emerge from negotiations with the European Union. But already there were worrisome signs that the \\\\\\\"remain\\\\\\\" camp's warnings of economic tumult could come true.  Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, warned his staff in a memo Friday that, in months to come, \\\\\\\"we may need to make changes to our European legal entity structure and the location of some roles.\\\\\\\" Dimon had said before the vote that up to a quarter of JPMorgan's 16,000 employees in Britain might need to relocate.

Juergen Maier, the top executive in Britain of Siemens, the German electronics and engineering giant, said it might need to rethink its investment plans. He predicted others would do the same, at least until they can judge the impact of Brexit.  \\\\\\\"All companies will be holding fire to see what happens,\\\\\\\" Maier said.  For decades, big multinational companies have used Britain as their business-friendly, English-speaking beachhead to Europe. As a member of the European Union, Britain offered frictionless access to the mainland, while the legacy of Margaret Thatcher meant there was far less regulation than in France or Germany.  Now that the English Channel suddenly seems a lot wider, businesses are waiting nervously to see what kind of new Europe will take shape. Negotiations on a post-Brexit trade relationship are likely to be messy and take years. And in the meantime, Europe could be in for serious political instability as right-wing parties in France, Finland and other countries try to ride Britain's coattails out of the union.  It is not all bad for business. The plunging pound will help the tourism industry by making Britain a cheaper place to visit. BMW Mini automobiles and other products manufactured in Britain will be less expensive for people paying in euros and other foreign currencies. That could be good for exports.  Britain could also be free to follow its free market instincts without interference from Brussels.

Technology companies could be under pressure to move sales and marketing jobs from Britain, so these employees can still have access to Europe's common marketplace.  The ties are especially close between Britain and Germany, where the dismay was particularly pronounced. Britain imports more products from Germany than anywhere else. Britain is Germany's third-largest customer for exports, after the United States and France.  German brands like BMW, Mercedes and Volkswagen account for half the cars sold in Britain, according to the German Association of the Automobile Industry. Sales could suffer if Britain raises tariffs on imported vehicles. Shares of BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen plunged Friday.  German companies have helped keep alive manufacturing in Britain. Mini and Rolls-Royce are considered iconic British car brands, but both are owned by BMW. Bentley belongs to Volkswagen.

{"instruction": "Extract attitudes between entities and topics from the article in JSON format and categorize them [Positive, Neutral, Negative] and justify them quoting the article", "input": "Four years ago almost to the day, the then mayor of London, Boris Johnson, appeared on the David Letterman show. He did what he does best: brag outrageously about himself in a way that was at once endearingly ironic yet made no attempt to disguise the size of his astronomical ambitions.  \\\\\\\"I suppose I could be president of the United States,\\\\\\\" he said, \\\\\\\"you know, technically speaking.\\\\\\\"    That brag would no longer apply today. The New York-born and hence US citizen Johnson, 52, renounced his American passport last year in a wrangle over IRS taxes. With it went all hope - tongue-in-cheek or otherwise - of ever occupying the White House.  Besides, the famously blond-haired conservative now has his eyes on other targets. On the back of his embrace of the Leave cause in the British referendum on membership of the European Union, and its shock victory on Thursday, he has been propelled into a position he has long coveted: front-running contender for No 10 Downing Street.  Shortly after David Cameron announced his resignation as prime minister on Friday, bookmakers declared Johnson favorite to succeed his Tory party colleague in the fall.  \\\\\\\"I believe we now have a glorious opportunity,\\\\\\\" Johnson said, referring to the future of the nation in words that could equally be applied to his own.  This is the moment for Boris, a British politician who has entered that rarified club of those like Beyonc\\\\u00e9 or Drake who need no last name. Having spent years cultivating the look of a prize poodle in need of a good grooming, he is one of the most distinctive characters in the country.    He has also studiously honed and polished his public persona: part humorist, part wordsmith and statesman. Having been educated at Britain's most elite boarding school, Eton, with a plummy accent to match, he now claims the voice of the common man.  But such clever artifice leaves many Britons wondering where Boris the construct ends and the true Boris begins. An opinion poll this month had 41% of respondents saying they thought Johnson had thrown his hat in with the Leave camp because he believed it was best for the country; 39% thought it was done merely to forward his own political career.  That is a theme that stretches back to his early career as a journalist in Britain's notoriously cutthroat newspaper business. As Martin Fletcher reminded readers of the New York Times, in 1988 Johnson was sacked from the Times of London for making up a quote - he put words into the mouth of an Oxford don who also happened to be his godfather.

The Brexit vote also revealed that the UK, like the US, is deeply divided. Sections of the voting population have drastically different opinions on the current state of their country and what its future should look like.  Trump v Farage  Jowls and loud-mouthed xenophobia aside, in appearance and lifestyle the two men do not have much in common.  Donald Trump is a fake-tanned, image-obsessed New Yorker who does not drink or smoke and has never had a cup of coffee. Nigel Farage is a pasty-skinned, British-toothed cigarette smoker who grew up in the rolling countryside of southern England and has built a political career around drinking beer.  In terms of background, however, the two have plenty in common. Blue collar they are not. Trump inherited his father's wildly successful housing business. Farage attended a fee-paying school - only 7% of Britons do so - before earning millions as a stockbroker.  Despite this, both have shown an uncanny ability to appeal to the working man - mostly by stoking fears about immigration. Trump thinks Mexico is sending rapists to the US. Farage has not been as clear about what he thinks the European Union is sending to the UK, but the fact he has been hawking a billboard showing a line of thousands of huddled, dark-skinned refugees offers a clue.

He called for an across-the-board halt of all Muslims entering the country, warning they carried the risk of additional terror attacks.  While many Republicans hoped Trump would back away from his proposed ban on an entire religion, he embraced it even tighter after the Orlando shootings.  \\\\\\\"We need to tell the truth, also, about how radical Islam is coming to our shores,\\\\\\\" Trump said in the wake of the attack. \\\\\\\"And it's coming. With these people, folks, it's coming.\\\\\\\"  Trump even blamed \\\\\\\"Muslim communities,\\\\\\\" en masse, for failing to tip off authorities about both the Orlando and San Bernardino attacks.  \\\\\\\"The idea of nativism - of seeing your country under threat by non-natives, specifically immigrants and Muslims, is something that Marine Le Pen and Donald Trump clearly share,\\\\\\\" says Cas Mudde, a University of Georgia professor, who specializes in nationalist movements.  Le Pen heads the National Front party in France. In the wake of last year's Paris terror attacks, she told NPR that France needed \\\\\\\"to institute a major policy, which would reestablish our own borders. This means we need to stop accepting this influx of immigrants.\\\\\\\"  She called the continued flow of Syrian refugees into Europe \\\\\\\"madness\\\\\\\" and urged for an end to the open-border policy that is a hallmark of the European Union.  \\\\\\\"I think when people are disappointed and hurt and angry, they revert to a very basic part of human psychology,\\\\\\\" Mounk says. \\\\\\\"And that is in-group versus out-group. Us versus them. And it's always easy to blame immigrants.\\\\\\\"  It can be popular, too. Exit polls conducted throughout the Republican primaries this year consistently showed a solid majority of GOP voters supporting Trump's call for a temporary ban on Muslim immigration.  Simple solutions  Mounk says the basic approach of many populist, nationalist candidates can be boiled down to this: \\\\\\\"I embody the will of the people. And the problems that we face are actually completely straightforward,\\\\\\\" he said. \\\\\\\"The problem is that the elites are corrupt. They are in cahoots with minorities, with business interests. And all that needs to happen is for me to be elected.\\\\\\\"  It's a sentiment that can be heard in Trump's most recent major campaign speech. \\\\\\\"When I see the crumbling roads and bridges, or the dilapidated airports, or the factories moving overseas to Mexico, or to other countries for that matter,\\\\\\\" he said, \\\\\\\"I know these problems can all be fixed. But not by Hillary Clinton. Only by me.\\\\\\\"  The best example of a simple solution to a complex problem: Trump's vow to curtail immigrants from entering the country illegally by building a wall across the U.S.-Mexico border - and forcing Mexico to foot the bill.  Hungary's Prime Minister, Viktor Orban, is perhaps the most high-profile nationalist politician to head a nation. He went ahead and built a wall of his own last year in an attempt to stem the flow of migrants from Syria.  \\\\\\\"Many people criticize the physical barrier we are just setting up at this moment in Hungary,\\\\\\\" he said at the European Union headquarters in Brussels last year. \\\\\\\"I ask everybody - all the European leaders - what else ideas they have.\\\\\\\"  Is nationalism here to stay?

Global stocks tanked, and the British pound crashed to a 31-year low. World leaders from the U.S. to Japan to Germany spoke out about the far-reaching effects the referendum would have.  The scale of this reaction was predictable - after all, the U.K. joined the EU's predecessor, the EEC (European Economic Community), back in 1973 and has been one of its most influential members for decades. As the (now formerly!) fifth-largest economy in the world, even moderate changes in Britain's political stance affect global markets.  So why did the U.K. vote for something so politically and economically disruptive? Some say race has a lot to do with it - specifically, the racial tension that has resulted from the U.K.'s recently welcoming in record numbers of immigrants. In 2015, 630,000 foreign national migrants came to the U.K. from both inside and outside the EU. This year, the U.K. has ushered in an additional 333,000.  The campaign to get the U.K. to leave the EU (also known as the \\\\\\\"Leave\\\\\\\" campaign) was spearheaded by the right-wing, populist UK Independence Party, or UKIP. The party, led by Member in the European Parliament Nigel Farage, says that the EU \\\\\\\"means the end of the UK as an independent, self-governing nation with its own government and its own borders.\\\\\\\"  For months, UKIP has fought for the United Kingdom's independence from the EU - some say by capitalizing on racially charged animus toward immigrants. In the Washington Post, writer Anyusha Rose points to the Leave campaign as evidence that in the U.K., \\\\\\\"racism is no longer racism - it's legitimate opinion.\\\\\\\"  Areeq Chowdhury, a British writer and the founder of WebRoots Democracy, said last week that it's \\\\\\\"important we remember that this is a referendum that has only been made possible due to a long, hard-fought campaign by those on the far-right and political movements ridden with allegations of bigotry, xenophobia, and racism.\\\\\\\" He continues:  \\\\\\\"Nigel Farage - the UKIP leader who once said that his party 'would never win the nigger vote,' refers to Chinese takeaways as 'a chinky,' and said people would feel 'concerned' to live next to Romanians - is the man who should take a significant chunk of the credit for us having this referendum. It was his party's success in the European Parliament elections, as well as defections which he brokered from the Conservative Party, which has led us to this point today.\\\\\\\"  Zack Beauchamp over at Vox writes that the UKIP has spent the past 10 years \\\\\\\"focusing, obsessively, on the threat from immigrants, from both inside the EU and out.\\\\\\\"  That work seems to have been fruitful. Beauchamp says, \\\\\\\"Over the course of the past 20 years, the percentage of Britons ranking 'immigration/race relations' as among the country's most important issues has gone from near zero percent to about 45 percent. Seventy-seven percent of Brits today believe that immigration levels should be reduced.\\\\\\\"  Many politicians say anti-immigration sentiment should not necessarily be cast as racism - they argue that immigrants take jobs from native-born British citizens, that immigration drives down wages for everyone, and that the desire to keep jobs abundant and wages high is a goal that millions share, across racial and political lines.

Still, concern about the rate of immigration is central to Lee's list.  But James Bloodworth, writing for International Business Times, says the issue can not be explained in purely economic terms. Even as the number of migrants arriving in the U.K. rose to a record 333,000 in May of this year, immigrants have been an overall boon to the British economy. Bloodworth explains:  \\\\\\\"Hostility to immigration - and by extension hostility to Europe - is driven by cultural concerns as much as by economic worries. That's certainly what the University of Oxford's Migration Observatory has been saying in recent years. It has pointed out on a number of occasions that cultural concerns better explain negative attitudes towards migration than a person's economic position. In essence it is about whether England feels like England.\\\\\\\"  J.K. Rowling, author of the Harry Potter series, cautions against casting everyone who backed the Leave movement as a bigot but also writes about the danger of painting immigrants as monsters and villains:  \\\\\\\"Leave has been busy threatening us with another monster: a tsunami of faceless foreigners heading for our shores, among them rapists and terrorists. \\\\\\\"It is dishonourable to suggest, as many have, that Leavers are all racists and bigots: they are not and it is shameful to suggest that they are. Nevertheless, it is equally nonsensical to pretend that racists and bigots are not flocking to the 'Leave' cause, or that they are not, in some instances, directing it. For some of us, that fact alone is enough to give us pause. The picture of Nigel Farage standing in front of a poster showing a winding line of Syrian refugees captioned 'Breaking Point' is, as countless people have already pointed out, an almost exact duplicate of propaganda used by the Nazis.\\\\\\\"  Some British politicians are trying to soften the blow. Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, wrote a message on his Facebook page telling EU residents living in London that they are welcome and that the city is grateful for them.  Lauren Hansen, a writer at The Week, wrote, \\\\\\\"Mayor Khan's comments are especially poignant in this post-Brexit world as the continent's largest city grapples with the tension between an anti-immigration sentiment and the diversity that makes London, and cities like it, thrive both economically and culturally.\\\\\\\"  Of course, it would be remiss not to mention the parallels that many are drawing between the Brexit movement and Donald Trump's campaign rhetoric. Trump has publicly supported Britain's vote to leave the EU, and folks told NPR's Frank Langfitt that \\\\\\\"similar issues - globalization and economics - are driving the Brexit and U.S. presidential campaigns.\\\\\\\"  In an article called \\\\\\\"What Do The Brexit Movement And Donald Trump Have In Common?\\\\\\\" the New Yorker's John Cassidy wrote:  \\\\\\\"Certainly, a parallel factor in both men's rise is racism, or, more specifically, nativism. Trump has presented a nightmarish vision of America overrun by Mexican felons and Muslim terrorists.

The EU's leaders will have to take a very tough line in the negotiations about the EU's post-Brexit relations with the U.K. A horrible example will be required to show the nationalists and populists in other member states that leaving is hard and painful. And to preserve the EU, they will have to abolish or drastically restructure the euro (but that had become necessary anyway).  The odds are, however, the EU will survive.

This article was published 24/06/2016 (3054 days ago), so information in it may no longer be current.  In the end, anti-intellectualism won.  \\\\\\\"I think people in this country,\\\\\\\" declared Vote Leave's Michael Gove, \\\\\\\"have had enough of experts.\\\\\\\" This was in response to Great Britain's \\\\\\\"remain\\\\\\\" campaign that had experts lined up, solid in their belief the British economy would fare better if the country remained part of the European Union.  Early Friday, it was clear that experts be damned, leaving the EU was what the majority of Britons want. With the outcome of the Brexit vote, Prime Minister David Cameron resigned and has said he will leave the unprecedented task of managing the country's exit up to his successor, who many believe will be MP Boris Johnson, the former London mayor who campaigned heavily for the leave side.  Many think MP Boris Johnson will be the U.K.'s next PM.  Mr. Johnson himself was never a markedly pro-exit politician, however, he is extremely ambitious. He became a cheerleader for the leave campaign in order to situate himself as the heir apparent for the Conservative party and he was ruthless in his tactics, relying on misleading information about the cost of EU to Britain and invoking racist and anti-immigrant rhetoric. He did not act alone in that regard.  U.K. Independence Party Leader Nigel Farage, who was also pro-exit, fuelled antagonisms toward foreigners as well. The party, founded in the early 1990s on an anti-European platform with strong anti-immigrant and anti-homosexual beliefs, has become home for neo-Nazis and supporters of the far-right who actively campaigned for the leave side. They pitched a vision that Britons can take their country back. And it sold. Much like in the United States, where presumptive Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has won support for his pledge to \\\\\\\"make America great again.\\\\\\\"  Anti-immigration sentiments in both countries have hit their mark. In the United Kingdom, researchers say that between 1993 and 2014, the foreign-born population more than doubled, to around 8.3 million from 3.8 million. Many of those immigrants are from countries such as Poland, Spain, Portugal, and Italy, who came to Britain for better jobs as the economy weakened.  In the U.S., with immigration and particularly Mexican immigration pushing the number of immigrants to record highs, there are concerns about losses of jobs as well. Add to this the fear of attacks by Muslims in both the U.S. and in Europe and the U.K., with both Mr. Farage and Mr. Trump warning women are at risk of rape by Muslim men, and xenophobia became an easy sell.  In the U.K., as in the U.S., this fear of the \\\\\\\"other\\\\\\\" - the foreigner who can take away your job, rape your daughters, and steal your homeland - is a comforting theme. It's an easily identified target, and for many of those who support both Mr. Trump and those who were on the \\\\\\\"leave\\\\\\\" side - older, white, less educated, blue collar - it's a simplistic rationale for a failure to thrive.

There is some analogy with the comeuppance given the American political class by the fighting bulls of left, centre and right: Bernie Sanders, Donald Trump and Ted Cruz. In both these principal sections of the Western world, the political institutions have been misused by feeble, cynical and inept leaders. There are both similarities and distinctions between the American and European experiences, and both should be recognized.  The similarities between the levels of public discontent in the United Kingdom and the United States are that the countries are angry and fearful at job losses to unfair trade agreements. and unwise and illegal immigration, and at the lassitude and patronizing detachment of their executive and legislative leaders. In Britain, the special flourish is the anti-democratic nature of the Brussels authority that intrudes more and more constantly into the lives of average people. Brussels is essentially supranational civil servants issuing an unceasing torrent of authoritarian directives down on all parts of life in the EU. This imposition has grated steadily on the British, from the display of bananas in supermarkets to the (one-size-fits-all) size of condoms, to the revocability of the decisions of the highest courts of the United Kingdom by the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg.  In Britain, the special flourish is the anti-democratic nature of the Brussels authority that intrudes more and more constantly into the lives of average people.  This is where the U.S. comparison stops - that country has not surrendered its sovereignty, but its voters are outraged that since it became the only, and unrivaled, superpower since the Roman Empire, it has blundered into the worst economic disaster in 80 years, decades of costly Middle Eastern wars that have been expertly and bravely conducted by the armed forces but have diluted America's strategic position, and a feckless foreign policy that has waffled between bellicosity (George W. Bush) and appeasement (Barack Obama). The country keeps turning out the rascals and getting more incompetent and venal rascals. At least in the United States, the despised political class is not a group of foreigners and it is possible to get rid of them, as the country is doing, without complicating foreign and constitutional relations.  Before becoming too alarmed about developments in either the United Kingdom or the United States, let us remember that the people are right, in both cases, to be profoundly dissatisfied with their governments and to seek reform by the legitimate and constitutional means both countries have developed and refined and protected over centuries. And between them, they are chiefly responsible for the spread of democracy in the world, including in most of what is now the European Union.

The Europe Britain has rejected, led by the unelected ciphers of Brussels, was a mad concept and it was never going to work as planned. All sane people celebrated the end of the terrible animosities that had riven Europe since the Middle Ages, especially the Franco-German rapprochement achieved by German chancellor Konrad Adenauer and French president Charles de Gaulle in 1963. The Common Market, which began with six states and the Treaty of Rome in 1957, grew in lurches, including de Gaulle's somewhat capricious veto of British entry in 1963, and became the European Union, committed to a federal state of 28 sovereign countries. There were repeated instances of hair's-breadth referendum results in different countries.

The Europe Britain has rejected, led by the unelected ciphers of Brussels, was a mad concept and it was never going to work as planned.  The greatest voice of caution after the retirement of de Gaulle in 1969 was Margaret Thatcher, who was finally pushed out by her own party despite having been the greatest peace-time prime minister in British history, at least since Disraeli and Gladstone (and a very good war and Cold War leader also).  Her offence was overt Euroskepticism, and she has been proved right and last night was her victory, too.

The economic reaction is the usual idiocy of currency speculators and money managers, and will calm down quickly; even if Britain did withdraw altogether, the economic consequences would be neutral. But the mask has fallen from the plump, ruddy face of Brussels.  I predict that there will gradually emerge a German-led bloc, including the Baltic and Scandinavian countries (except Norway), and the Netherlands, Austria, and probably the Poles and Czechs. In former four-term chancellor Helmut Kohl's expression, it will be \\\\\\\"a European Germany, not a German Europe.\\\\\\\" It will to some degree be the Grosse Deutschland sought by Bismarck, but assembled now by friendship, prosperity and example. The Germans will probably want to retain a couple of weak members in the euro to soften it and facilitate the sale of sophisticated German engineered products abroad.  The French will revive, after years of political floundering, as they always do eventually, and will more or less be at the head of the Mediterranean group and Belgium, in a looser echelon of states. The Eastern European members will progress at their own rate toward the French- or German-led groups. Britain will revert to its game, played with great skill from Wolsey to Thatcher, of being friendly with all but shifting its weight as necessary to prevent the worrisome pre-eminence of any, and recruiting the Americans when they can not hold the balance themselves. There will be some level of a Common Market with easy flows of money and people (but not swarms of migrants), between all the present EU members.

As much as the British want to believe their islands have a destiny separate from that of the continent, they have in fact been pacesetters for Europe writ large, from the consolidation of parliamentary democracy to the industrial revolution to the market reforms of the 1980s. The \\\\\\\"Brexit\\\\\\\" debate, although in many ways peculiarly British, amplifies broader trends in European politics - including questioning the fundamentals behind the unity of the continent - that are likely to intensify rather than subside. In unsettling ways, the June 23 referendum has put the future of Europe, the transatlantic alliance and the international liberal order itself in play and done little to settle them.  First, globalisation has produced a backlash in which national and local identities are ascendant. The British referendum campaign has underlined how a country whose cosmopolitan capital is a hub of global finance nonetheless prizes a more narrow English nationalism - even as the likelihood of pro-EU Scotland threatening to secede from the UK grows in the aftermath of Brexit. Residents of London, a bastion of \\\\\\\"Remain\\\\\\\" voters, see a hugely successful city whose multiracial, multilingual population resembles the world in miniature with even more richness. By contrast, many Brexit voters apparently viewed such diversity as a threat, succumbing to nativist appeals to clamp down on immigration - even though it has made Britain more prosperous and dynamic. \\\\\\\"Leave\\\\\\\" voters were willing to risk economic calamity, including a collapsing stock market and currency as well as an expected serious hit to household incomes, to assert their \\\\\\\"independence\\\\\\\" from Europe - attesting to the reality that people can be motivated by considerations other than just prosperity.  Second, the British referendum has highlighted a wider divide over how best to prosper in a competitive global economy. Brexiteers argued that the UK could more nimbly seize overseas trade and investment opportunities by cutting loose from the EU - even though the Union is the world's trading superpower, pursuing ambitious free trade agreements in Asia and America over the heads of more protectionist member states, and despite the fact that Britain sends nearly half its exports to Europe. \\\\\\\"Leave\\\\\\\" advocates painted a rosy picture of the dividends that would accrue from a UK-US free trade agreement - even as US leaders warned that England detached from Europe would go \\\\\\\"to the back of the queue\\\\\\\" in trade negotiations with the US. Brexit supporters invoked Elizabethan England, when buccaneers scoured the world's seas for treasure, as if the piracy of Sir Walter Raleigh were a relevant recipe for prosperity today. Happily, the Leave campaign's leaders did not promise the kind of protectionism that US presidential candidate Bernie Sanders has advocated by opposing free trade agreements, arguing instead that Britain's liberal economic instincts were being suppressed by Brussels bureaucrats. Perhaps, but EU membership has probably been a more liberalizing force in the UK than a protectionist one; under EU rules, Britain could not impose unilateral tariffs to save its failing steel industry, for example.  A weakened alliance  Third, the hard reality of Brexit raises urgent questions about the future of European integration.

Anti-immigrant, nationalist parties have the support of a quarter of voters in bastions of moderation like Sweden. Some on the continent actually supported Brexit as a way-station to a European fiscal union in a smaller but more integrated eurozone. But to halt the march of populist forces rallying against the \\\\\\\"tyranny\\\\\\\" of Brussels, British advocacy within the EU of more liberal economic policies within EU councils probably would have served as a better antidote. Shared Franco-German-British leadership of the EU is also preferable to the more Berlin-centric approach, and which Germans themselves do not want.  Fourth, Britain's referendum raises questions about how smaller European nations can successfully engage with the big civilization-states of the 21st century. Leaders in both America and China, the reigning superpower and the rising one, publicly urged Britain to stay in the EU. For China, the UK is a gateway to investments in Europe and a financial hub for internationalizing the renminbi. The \\\\\\\"golden decade\\\\\\\" in UK-China relations promised by Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne is likely to be stillborn as Britain severs its access to the European single market. Britain is America's closest ally in the EU. The \\\\\\\"special relationship\\\\\\\" between Washington and London has amplified the power and influence of both within European councils and in the wider world. A Britain unmoored from the continent is a less obvious top-tier partner for the United States. British officials should know that Chinese and Indian leaders may have less time for representatives of a small set of islands and 65 million than those embedded at the heart of the world's largest economy, the European Union.  Fifth, Britain's referendum raises warnings about how smaller European powers navigate a dangerous geopolitical environment. Brexit does not revoke Britain's NATO membership. But even the prospect of breaking away from its EU partners would not in any way strengthen the alliance. Russia under Vladimir Putin is pursuing a concerted strategy of dividing the West. The fracturing of European and transatlantic solidarity risked by Brexit creates further openings for Russia to unpick the binding post-Cold War settlement. China is subverting the liberal international order, using the threat of military force to control the global commons of the South China Sea and building parallel institutions like the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank as tools of geo-economic influence. The calamity in Syria has produced a world more awash in refugees than at any time since the Second World War, with many of them heading directly for safe havens in Europe. A Britain that exits the European Union is not obviously in a better position to deal with any of these daunting strategic challenges; it may find iself less able to shape international outcomes or leverage its US and European alliances to reduce threats to its security.  Britain's voters have spoken. As one senior diplomat put it on learning of the Brexit outcome. \\\\\\\"We were a great nation for hundreds of years before the EU and we will still be a great nation afterwards.\\\\\\\" But these broader dynamics remain - the tension between globalisation and national identity, the imperative of economic competitiveness in a more multipolar world of diffused technology, the future of a troubled European Union beset by slow growth and populist politics,", "output": "{\"topical_attitudes\": [{\"source\": {\"entity\": \"Brexit\", \"references\": [\"Brexit\"]}, \"target\": {\"topic\": \"European Union membership\", \"references\": [\"EU\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"A Britain unmoored from the continent is a less obvious top-tier partner for the United States.\", \"Brexit does not revoke Britain's NATO membership.\"], \"attitude\": \"Negative\"}, {\"source\": {\"entity\": \"China\", \"references\": [\"China\"]}, \"target\": {\"topic\": \"Brexit\", \"references\": [\"Brexit\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"For China, the UK is a gateway to investments in Europe and a financial hub for internationalizing the renminbi.\", \"The 'golden decade' in UK-China relations promised by Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne is likely to be stillborn as Britain severs its access to the European single market.\"], \"attitude\": \"Negative\"}, {\"source\": {\"entity\": \"Russia\", \"references\": [\"Russia\"]}, \"target\": {\"topic\": \"Brexit\", \"references\": [\"Brexit\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"Russia under Vladimir Putin is pursuing a concerted strategy of dividing the West.\", \"The fracturing of European and transatlantic solidarity risked by Brexit creates further openings for Russia to unpick the binding post-Cold War settlement.\"], \"attitude\": \"Negative\"}, {\"source\": {\"entity\": \"America\", \"references\": [\"America\"]}, \"target\": {\"topic\": \"Brexit\", \"references\": [\"Brexit\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"Leaders in both America and China, the reigning superpower and the rising one, publicly urged Britain to stay in the EU.\"], \"attitude\": \"Negative\"}, {\"source\": {\"entity\": \"China\", \"references\": [\"China\"]}, \"target\": {\"topic\": \"EU integration\", \"references\": [\"European fiscal union\", \"more integrated eurozone\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"Some on the continent actually supported Brexit as a way-station to a European fiscal union in a smaller but more integrated eurozone.\"], \"attitude\": \"Positive\"}], \"entity_attitudes\": [{\"entity1\": {\"entity\": \"British government\", \"references\": [\"Britain\"]}, \"entity2\": {\"entity\": \"European Union\", \"references\": [\"EU\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"A Britain unmoored from the continent is a less obvious top-tier partner for the United States.\", \"Brexit does not revoke Britain's NATO membership.\"], \"attitude\": \"Negative\"}, {\"entity1\": {\"entity\": \"China\", \"references\": [\"China\"]}, \"entity2\": {\"entity\": \"Britain\", \"references\": [\"UK\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"For China, the UK is a gateway to investments in Europe and a financial hub for internationalizing the renminbi.\", \"The 'golden decade' in UK-China relations promised by Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne is likely to be stillborn as Britain severs its access to the European single market.\"], \"attitude\": \"Negative\"}, {\"entity1\": {\"entity\": \"Russia\", \"references\": [\"Russia\"]}, \"entity2\": {\"entity\": \"Britain\", \"references\": [\"Britain\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"Russia under Vladimir Putin is pursuing a concerted strategy of dividing the West.\", \"The fracturing of European and transatlantic solidarity risked by Brexit creates further openings for Russia to unpick the binding post-Cold War settlement.\"], \"attitude\": \"Negative\"}, {\"entity1\": {\"entity\": \"Britain\", \"references\": [\"Britain\"]}, \"entity2\": {\"entity\": \"United States\", \"references\": [\"United States\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"Britain is America's closest ally in the EU.\", \"The 'special relationship' between Washington and London has amplified the power and influence of both within European councils and in the wider world.\"], \"attitude\": \"Positive\"}, {\"entity1\": {\"entity\": \"United States\", \"references\": [\"United States\"]}, \"entity2\": {\"entity\": \"Britain\", \"references\": [\"Britain\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"Britain is America's closest ally in the EU.\", \"The 'special relationship' between Washington and London has amplified the power and influence of both within European councils and in the wider world.\"], \"attitude\": \"Positive\"}]}"}

From London, they were able to sell their services across 28 nations without the headache of having to get regulatory approval from each individual country. The prospect of a more complex, and potentially costly, regulatory structure has some banking officials worried, analysts said.  Some of America's largest banks, including Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase, contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars to efforts to stop Britain from withdrawing from the European Union - popularly known as Brexit - worried it would disrupt their global operations and force them to rethink where and how they do business in Europe. Several have indicated that they would be forced to move thousands of employees out of London, which has acted as the headquarters of their European operations.  NEW YORK - Wall Street banks on Friday scrambled to contain the fallout from Britain's stunning vote to break ties with the European Union.  Get Starting Point A guide through the most important stories of the morning, delivered Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Enter Email Sign Up  ''U.S. banks have used London as a primary center for activity, not only to operate in the U.K., but to provide services across Europe,'' said James Chessen, chief economist for the American Bankers Association.  Advertisement  Goldman Sachs contributed 500,000 pounds to the ''Remain'' campaign, according a person familiar with the company. So did JPMorgan Chase, the country's largest bank by assets, according to a person familiar with the matter. Citigroup and Morgan Stanley donated 250,000 pounds each, according to the Sunlight Foundation.  Citigroup created a ''group of senior leaders from across our businesses and functions to ensure we were prepared for this possible outcome,'' Mike Corbat, the bank's chief executive, and Jim Cowles, its chief executive in Europe, Middle East and Africa, said in a letter to employees Friday morning. ''While the result of the vote is not what we would have preferred, our diligent work over the past six months means we can be confident that Citi is well positioned to continue to serve our clients.''  U.S. banks are likely to move some employees from London to other parts of Europe, and Frankfurt or Paris may emerge as the new financial center for the region, industry analysts said.  Advertisement  Earlier this month, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon warned about the effect a British vote to leave the EU would have on the bank, which has about 16,000 employees in Britain. ''After a Brexit we cannot do it all here, and we will have to start planning for that. I do not know if it means a thousand jobs, 2,000 jobs. It could be as many as 4,000,'' he said from Bournemouth on the southern coast of England, according to the BBC.  On Friday, Dimon told employees in a letter that JPMorgan will maintain a large presence in London, Bournemouth and Scotland.  ''In the months ahead, however, we may need to make changes to our European legal entity structure and the location of some roles,'' Dimon said. ''While these changes are not certain, we have to be prepared to comply with new laws as we serve our clients around the world.''

Over time, he has been unduly chiding in his manner, reproachful about the affairs of another country in how it would vote on its relationship with the European Union.  In April, Obama warned British voters that a trade deal with the United States would be a rather tough thing from outside the European Union. \\\\\\\"It could be five years from now, 10 years from now before we are actually able to get something done.\\\\\\\"[1]  Whatever pretence the United States maintains about the equal order of states, sovereignty and its \\\\\\\"special relationships,\\\\\\\" traditional imperial values are powerful.

The case for Britain's exit from Europe has been treated as a dramatic blow against the imperium's three main concerns on the continent: its own, fragile economic recovery, the broader trade agenda spearheaded with the EU, and matters of security.

It has dawned on some European lawmakers that the TTIP is less a citizen's charter than that of a corporation's.  Obama's insistence here has been to keep stand by previous statements that Brexit would lead to a banishment of Britain to the back of the negotiating queue. White House spokesman Eric Schultz reiterated the point immediately after the vote. \\\\\\\"Obviously, the president stands by what he said and I do not have an update of our position.\\\\\\\"[2] Bad children who openly disregard the wishes of their teachers tend to find themselves at the back of the classroom.

The Remain campaign began with a sham, was monomaniacal with its Project Fear, and ended in governmental thuggishness.  The sham was Prime Minister David Cameron's attempt to justify Remain by negotiating EU concessions regarding Britain's subservience to the EU. This dickering for scraps of lost sovereignty underscored Britain's servitude and achieved so little that Remainers rarely mentioned it during their campaign.  Project Fear was the relentless and ultimately ludicrous parade of Cassandras, \\\\\\\"experts\\\\\\\" all, warning that Britain, after more than a millennium of sovereign existence, and now with the world's fifth-largest economy, would endure myriad calamities were it to end its 23-year membership in the EU. Remain advocates rarely even feigned enthusiasm for the ramshackle, sclerotic EU. Instead, they implausibly promised that if Brexit were rejected, Britain - although it would then be without the leverage of the threat to leave - would nevertheless somehow negotiate substantially better membership terms than Cameron managed when Brexit was an option.  Voters were not amused by the Cameron government's threat of what critics called a Punishment Budget to inflict pain on pensioners (e.g., no more free bus passes) and others because Brexit might cause GDP to contract 9.5 percent and home prices might plummet 18 percent. Voters did not like being told that they really had no choice. And that it was too late to escape from entanglement in the EU's ever-multiplying tentacles. And that the very viscosity of the EU's statism guarantees its immortality.  Voters chose the optimism of Brexit. Sixty years after Britain's humiliation in the Suez debacle, Britain has a spring in its step, confident that it will flourish when Brussels no longer controls 60 to 70 percent of the British government's actions. Britain was last conquered by an invading army in 1066. In 2016, it repelled an attempted conquest by the EU's nomenklatura.  By breaking the leftward-clicking ratchet that moves steadily, and only, toward more \\\\\\\"pooled\\\\\\\" sovereignty and centralization of power, Brexit refutes the progressive narrative that history has an inexorable trajectory that \\\\\\\"experts\\\\\\\" discern and before which all must bow.

Mundil  Only days after the Brexit shock, a new word has been invented in Great Britain: \\\\\\\"Regrexit\\\\\\\" - the growing regret about leaving the European Union. The worst part of the referendum is the fact that many of those who ticked the \\\\\\\"Leave\\\\\\\" box on their ballots will not get what they wanted out of it.  If you ask voters in disadvantaged parts of England why they are against Europe, they usually say something like \\\\\\\"We do not want to be told what to do\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\"We want more for ourselves.\\\\\\\" They want better schools, affordable housing, better jobs and higher wages. They were talked into believing that the European Union's rule over their country was to blame for their hardship, and so they did not seek fault in their own government. It was a masterpiece of manipulation.  It is tragic that former London Mayor Boris Johnson and his tacit partners from the UK Independence Party made promises that they will not be able to keep. They probably never intended to keep their promises; they have no interest in the face of the socially excluded people whom they convinced to vote \\\\\\\"Leave.\\\\\\\" The electorate only fed their desire for power.  DW's Barbara Wesel  Paying the piper  Low-income workers who have not seen a raise in wages for years and have little job security helped make the Brexit happen, but they will end up paying the prices for their decision. The pound is dropping, Britain's credit rating has been downgraded, and corporations are considering leaving the country. No one in the British government will replace the EU subsidies for Welsh farmers whose livelihoods depend on the money, just as steelworkers in Port Talbot will never find proper jobs again and their opportunities will further decline after Brexit.  The campaign Boris Johnson, Nigel Farage and like-minded Leavers waged was a propaganda assault of incomparable perfidiousness. They lied, deceived the British people, spread false facts, made Nazi comparisons and talked people into believing that the sun would shine on their land of milk and honey. And the people believed it because they wanted to believe it. They have been seduced by a modern Pied Piper who won the referendum on the basis of a racist campaign.  The tragedy can be ascribed to a lack of knowledge and angry resistance to the nation's elite. Many Britons who believe that the European Union is the source of their woes do not understand the consequences of their decision. Google reported that, after polling stations had closed, searches on \\\\\\\"What is the EU?\\\\\\\" increased significantly.

EU leaders are anxious that the Brexit process should start rapidly following the UK's referendum, which resulted in a vote to leave the union and the subsequent resignation of Prime Minister David Cameron, who had led the remain campaign.  Follow the latest live updates  Mr Cameron's decision to delay the process and let his successor handle the ramifications of a Brexit has generated frustration among EU leaders, who are now determined to push the UK for a swift termination of Britain's membership.

In her \\\\\\\"reporter's notebook,\\\\\\\" European culture correspondent Rachel Donadio did not hide her contempt for the \\\\\\\"open xenophobia\\\\\\\" of the Leave side. Also, White House reporters Julie Hirschfeld Davis and Mark Landler sadly revealed just how much the voters of Britain have disappointed President Obama.  Donadio wrote from Paris:  .... the news stung. For me and others of my generation, this vote was about more than Britain's relationship with Europe. It signaled the definitive end of the era of transnational optimism in which I came of age: the '90s. Back then, we believed that interconnectedness was a strength. People wanted to study human rights law. Nationalism was out of fashion -- at least in Western Europe -- and weaponized Twitter did not yet exist to galvanize political change. (Or rather, to take down institutions, not build them.)  For Donadio, it wasn't national sovereignty, distrust of unelected bureaucrats, or any abstract idea of freedom that had spurred British citizens to vote Leave, but \\\\\\\"open xenophobia.\\\\\\\" When she does acknowledge some of the EU's flaws, it seems the European Union's real woe boils down to a PR problem: It had not explained itself simply enough to the local dopes. Keep in mind this \\\\\\\"xenophobia\\\\\\\" charges is wnot contained in an Opinion-section piece, but in an article from a Times reporter in the news section of the paper:  This week, it wasn't Greece that was kicked out. It was Britain that voted to leave, after a campaign of open xenophobia. Leaving the euro is not the same as leaving the European Union, but the differences are too technical for many people to parse. That's the problem. The European Union has not done a good job of explaining its purpose -- it's too opaque, too bureaucratic, too confusing -- and its slow handling of the debt crisis, especially in Greece, where it acted fast so French and German banks could cut their losses, but left Greece asphyxiated, had devastating consequences for all. Decisions made for short-term financial stability have led to long-term political instability. I am struck by how the critiques of Europe from the right and left wind up converging. The Democracy in Europe movement, begun this year by the leftist Yanis Varoufakis, a polarizing former Greek finance minister, hits some of the same notes as Nigel Farage's right-wing U.K. Independence Party, criticizing Europe as antidemocratic and less than transparent. Still, the right appeals to nationalism and the left does not. The right sells a nostalgic version of national identity that resonates viscerally but does not reflect reality, especially not for young people born into a Europe of Erasmus scholarships that let them study across borders, and EasyJet, which lets them travel around on the cheap.  Also on Saturday, White House reporters Julie Hirschfeld Davis and Mark Landler sadly revealed just how much the voters of Britain have disappointed President Obama, who previously pettily threatened Britain with trade consequences if it did not fall in line and stay in the EU (it did not work). The Times painted Leave voters as insular and narrow-minded, in contrast to Obama's sunny cosmopolitanism, in \\\\\\\"Obama Acknowledges Loss but Says 'Special Relationship' Will Continue.\\\\\\\"  The \\\\\\\"Brexit\\\\\\\" vote runs counter to Mr. Obama's vision of open, interconnected societies, and it illustrates the frustrating cycle of his engagement with the world: \\\\\\\"America's first Pacific president,\\\\\\\" as Mr. Obama has called himself, who", "output": "{\"topical_attitudes\": [{\"source\": {\"topic\": \"Brexit\", \"references\": [\"Brexit\"]}, \"target\": {\"topic\": \"European Union\", \"references\": [\"European Union\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"The European Union has not done a good job of explaining its purpose -- it's too opaque, too bureaucratic, too confusing -- and its slow handling of the debt crisis, especially in Greece, where it acted fast so French and German banks could cut their losses, but left Greece asphyxiated, had devastating consequences for all.\"], \"attitude\": \"Negative\"}, {\"source\": {\"topic\": \"Brexit\", \"references\": [\"Brexit\"]}, \"target\": {\"topic\": \"open xenophobia\", \"references\": [\"open xenophobia\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"For Donadio, it wasn't national sovereignty, distrust of unelected bureaucrats, or any abstract idea of freedom that had spurred British citizens to vote Leave, but 'open xenophobia.'\"], \"attitude\": \"Negative\"}, {\"source\": {\"topic\": \"Brexit\", \"references\": [\"Brexit\"]}, \"target\": {\"topic\": \"transnational optimism\", \"references\": [\"transnational optimism\"]}, \"justifications\": [\"For me and others of my generation, this vote was about more than Britain's relationship with Europe.

On Monday, the secretary of state will become the first senior US official to visit London and Brussels since the UK's historic referendum on Thursday.  Speaking in Rome as he met with Italian foreign minister Paolo Gentiloni, Kerry emphasized the importance of thoughtful cooperation at a time of economic uncertainty and fears about crumbling European unity.  He said he would bring a message of US support to both capitals, but he offered no concrete suggestions for how the two sides should make good on the British decision.  \\\\\\\"One country has made a decision,\\\\\\\" Kerry said. \\\\\\\"Obviously, it is a decision that the United States had hoped would go the other way.
