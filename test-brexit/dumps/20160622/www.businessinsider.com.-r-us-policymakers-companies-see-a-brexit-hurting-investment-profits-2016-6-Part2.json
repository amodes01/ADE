London School of Economics researchers recently estimated that investment flows into Britain could fall as much as 22 percent as companies, including American firms, move operations elsewhere or put plans on hold in the wake of a leave vote. This would translate to a 2,200-British pound ($3,234) decline in real income per household, they said.  Advertisement  The study also concluded that two major bright spots in the UK economy, financial services and autos, would suffer from a Brexit.  LSE also said annual UK car manufacturing would decline by 181,000 units, or 12 percent, due to higher European tariffs if Britain reverts to World Trade Organization trading status.  It added that financial firms based in Britain would likely see \\\"big cuts\\\" after losing their \\\"passport\\\" arrangements to operate in EU countries without having to set up costly local subsidiaries.  JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon earlier this month warned staff in Bournemouth, where a quarter of the banking giant's 16,000 UK employees are based, that this would cost jobs.

I do not know if it means 1,000 jobs, 2,000 jobs; it could be as many as 4,000,\\\" Dimon said.  Ford Motor Co , which has factories scattered across the UK and Europe, told employees in a letter on Monday that it could face tariffs of up to 2.7 percent on UK engine exports and 10 percent on vehicles, potentially costing \\\"hundreds of millions of dollars every year.\\\"  \\\"This would significantly impact our business,\\\" Ford Britain Managing Director Andy Barratt wrote. Profits at Ford's European operations are just starting to return to pre-2008 crisis levels after years of losses and painful plant closures.  CHOCOLATE DIVERGENCE  Advertisement  Other firms that use Britain as an export base also worry about a gradual regulatory divergence between the UK and EU.  Mars Inc. Vice President for Public Affairs Matthias Berninger told Reuters that a post-Brexit Britain would likely want to set its own standards for food safety and chocolate or pet food ingredients, creating problems for a European production network optimized for efficiency over the past 40 years.  Moving employees between locations would be more problematic with new immigration restrictions that are being advocated by the \\\"leave\\\" camp, Mars Inc's Berninger added. A long-term deterioration of the pound would also eat into profit margins in the UK which is the M&Ms and Snickers maker's second-largest market worldwide.  \\\"All of those things are a headache that translates into costs that eat into profitability,\\\" Berninger said. \\\"It's a slow crash.\\\"  Advertisement  In choosing Britain as a base, U.S. companies often cite its more flexible labor market than the rest of Europe, the English language, the rule of law, and a creative culture, but without EU access, the appeal dims.  \\\"For us, EU membership is also a big reason why we have chosen Britain. Recent suggestions that the UK should leave the single market if it exits the EU are particularly concerning and potentially hugely damaging,\\\" wrote several corporate executives, including General Electric CEO Jeff Immelt, Cisco Systems Inc CEO Chuck Robbins, and Bloomberg LP chairman Michael Bloomberg in a letter published by the London Financial Times last month.
