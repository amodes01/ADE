His recent column on \\\"Is America Really in Decline? What We Can Learn from Britain\\\" raises a few points which shed some light on the declinist argument and on the case for Britain's exit from the European Union, or Brexit.  As Pethokoukis puts it, drawing on historian Robert Tombs, the so-called decline panic that Britain experienced in the post-1945 decades \\\"rests on two assumptions: First, Britain experienced a collapse in global influence and economic dynamism. Second, those results stemmed from 'long-standing failures' of the nation's core institutions.\\\"  Pethokoukis implies this was false. But a good bit of it is actually true. British influence in the world did decline precipitously after 1945, as British withdrawals from the eastern Mediterranean (1947) and East of Suez (1967-68) illustrate. Some of this decline resulted from the rise of the superpowers after 1945, who outmatched the U.K. There was nothing the U.K. could have done about this.  Loss of influence  Another and much more complicated problem was Britain's post-war economic weakness, which led directly to most of these withdrawals. In any case, this wasn't a panic: it felt like a loss of influence for the simple reason that it was a loss of influence.  Then there is Britain's post-war economic dynamism. Again, it is - to me - inarguable that Britain performed worse after 1945 than most of Western Europe. The question is why. It may, as Tombs implies, have been mere post-war catch-up. But it was likely more than that. Britain does seem to have suffered from union-induced overmanning and amateurism in sectors of British corporate management (car manufacturers spring to mind). Worse, after 1945, the U.K. went down the road of nationalization, currency controls and demand management, all of which tended to prioritize stability and vested interests over creative destruction and dynamism.  Pethokoukis is completely right, on the other hand, that this led to an assault on \\\"the nation's core institutions,\\\" which were taken to be stolid, stuck in the mud, and undynamic. The results can be seen if you look around any British town - all of which underwent an attack of architectural vandalism of the most Brutalist kind, in the belief that the large scale use of reinforced concerted was, ipso facto, modernizing and would somehow jolt the British psyche from its torpor.  More broadly, if there was a guiding theme in Britain between the early 1960s and the late 1990s, it was \\\"modernization.\\\" Of course, that term meant different things to different people - but by and large it meant more top-down control, relentless legislative fiddling, and, except during the Thatcher/Major era, an expanded state.  The U.S. is not the UK, but the comparison has its merits  This is not as far from the U.S. experience as Pethokoukis implies. We are not, fortunately, dwarfed by superpower competitors. On the other hand, there is near-peer China, a range of regional competitors, and we really have not won a war for 25 years. We are not at risk, right now, of a U.K.-style collapse, but we are on the back heel in Europe and the South China Sea, we are clearly doing far worse than that in the Middle East, and U.S. defense spending trends look a bit too much like those of the U.K. for comfort.  And, on the economic front, while we do look good compared to Europe, that's cold comfort - especially when President Obama's\"}"
