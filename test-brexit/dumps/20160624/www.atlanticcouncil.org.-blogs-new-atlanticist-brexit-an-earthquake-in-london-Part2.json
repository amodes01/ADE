Scotland voted 62 percent in favor of Remain, Wales voted 52.5 percent in favor of Leave, Northern Ireland voted 55.8 percent in favor of Remain, London voted 59.9 percent in favor of Remain, and the rest of England voted 57 percent in favor of Leave.  There was also a significant split between young and older voters. A majority of voters under the age of forty-nine were in favor of Remain with at least 75 percent under the age of twenty-four saying they had voted in favor of the United Kingdom remaining in the EU, according to a YouGov poll. A majority of older voters backed Leave.  The reaction among the youth is \\\"how could people be so irresponsible and dumb and misled by what they would regard as misinformation,\\\" said Westmacott. \\\"This is not a generation which is wildly enamored with the concept of an ever closer union. This is just a hard-nosed generation who are struggling, quite often, to get jobs\\u2026and they are pretty clear in their own mind that the economic and broader benefits of Britain as part of the European Union are very clear.\\\"  Westmacott compared supporters of the Leave campaign to Americans who back Donald Trump, the US Republican Party's presumptive presidential nominee.  The referendum is as much about disillusionment with the political status quo and a continuing sense in the United States and in the United Kingdom that the hard-working, tax-paying middleclass are being ignored while those responsible for the global financial crisis in 2008 continue to prosper and have not been held accountable, said Westmacott.  \\\"I very much hope that this does not prove to be the pulling of a thread on the old jumper. In other words, the unravelling of so much that European post-war construction has achieved,\\\" he added.  The 'special relationship  The United States and the United Kingdom share a \\\"special relationship.\\\" With the United Kingdom's decision to leave the EU, Washington will lose a friend at the negotiating table in Brussels.  The United States needs to rethink its approach to Europe, said Nougayrede. \\\"There has been a certain diffidence [toward Europe from the United States].\\\"  \\\"Saying Europe is a mess is just not enough,\\\" she added, noting that the United States should see the British referendum as a signal that it needs to find new ways to re-engage with Europe because the \\\"traditional way of doing things was not sufficient.\\\"  At the same time, anti-Americanism is growing across Europe. In a sign of Washington's anxiety about a Brexit, US President Barack Obama uncharacteristically weighed in on the debate on a visit to London in April this year. That intervention was insufficient, and \\\"we need to pause and think about why this did not work\\u2026and why official high-level messages may not be sufficient to keep Europe from dismantling this EU project,\\\" said Nougayrede.  On June 24, Obama expressed respect for the British voters' decision. \\\"The special relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom is enduring, and the United Kingdom's membership in NATO remains a vital cornerstone of US foreign, security, and economic policy,\\\" the president said. \\\"The United Kingdom and the European Union will remain indispensable partners of the United States even as they begin negotiating their ongoing relationship to ensure continued stability, security, and prosperity for Europe, Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and the world.\\\"  The United States and the United Kingdom are always going to have a\"}"
