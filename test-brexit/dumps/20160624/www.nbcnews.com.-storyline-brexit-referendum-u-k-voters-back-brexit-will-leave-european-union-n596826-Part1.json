Electoral officials said early Friday that the \\\"Leave\\\" campaign had racked up 17.4 million votes - compared to 16.1 million backing the status quo. That gave \\\"Leave\\\" 51.9 percent of the ballots against 48.1 percent for \\\"Remain,\\\" capping a deeply divisive campaign.  The vote served as an indictment of Britain's government and a barometer of domestic fears about immigration and the economy.  Prime Minister David Cameron - who had forcefully campaigned to stay in the EU - later announced he would step down, saying the country needed fresh leadership.  \\\"I do not think it would be right for me to be the captain that steers our country to its next destination,\\\" he told reporters outside his Downing Street office.  The vote for an exit - or Brexit - has sent shockwaves through global markets. The pound plunged to $1.35, its lowest level since 1985.  The EU now finds itself in uncharted waters: No nation state has ever left the bloc. The leaders of the EU institutions urged Britain to act quickly to formalize its exit \\\"however painful that process may be.\\\"  \\\"Any delay would unnecessarily prolong uncertainty,\\\" they said in a joint statement.

A Brexit forces it to reconcile losing its second-largest economy and a military powerhouse.  \\\"Remain\\\" campaigners had argued a Brexit would be disastrous for the British and even global economy - but the result showed voters were unswayed.  Instead, the \\\"Leave\\\" side - which railed against European regulations and increased migration in a heated campaign battle - was celebrating their triumph.  \\\"We have our country back,\\\" tweeted U.K. Independence Party leader Nigel Farage, a key figure in the \\\"Leave\\\" campaign.  He later told reporters the referendum was \\\"a victory for ordinary people, against the big banks, big business and big politics.\\\"  June 23rd must now be made a national holiday. #IndependenceDay pic.twitter.com/Aj7mEjPTnR - Nigel Farage (@Nigel_Farage) June 24, 2016  Britons who'd voted to remain were stunned by the result and nervous about what comes next.  \\\"I am really disappointed,\\\" said Charlotte English, 40. \\\"I did not want us to go out on a kind of anti-immigration, negative agenda.\\\"  The stay-at-home mom told NBC News that she used to live in France and now wonders what will happen with regards to visa-free travel in the EU.  \\\"There is a lot of uncertainty. I think that's what I am most stressed about,\\\" she explained.  That uncertainty hit markets particularly hard amid, given that the U.K. is the world's fifth-largest economy.  Officials attempted to reassure anxious investors, with the Bank of England saying it had made extensive contingency plans while London's mayor said there was \\\"no need to panic.\\\"  Some analysts have warned Britain's exit could trigger a domino effect, prompting other EU members to mull their own departures from the bloc.
