"{\"uid\": \"www.artsjournal.com.-worth-2016-06-brexit-and-culture-its-complicated-\", \"text\": \"Midsomer Murders is a long-running English detective series produced by ITV, based upon the characters created by Caroline Graham. Chief Inspector Barnaby and his team solve crimes in this (fictional) county of small villages and lovely rural landscapes. In Midsomer people ride their bicycles past thatched-roofed houses to attend fetes, go to Church of England Sunday services, and relax in the evenings at the local pub - it's all very peaceful, except of course for all the murders, difficult though not impossible to solve. In 2011 the show's producer, Brian True-May, was suspended by ITV for comments he made in an interview, in which he was asked why we never saw any ethnic minorities in Midsomer. The Telegraph reported:  \\\"We are a cosmopolitan society in this country, but if you watch Midsomer you would not think so. I have never been picked up on that, but quite honestly I would not want to change it,\\\" [True-May] said.  Asked what he meant by \\\"cosmopolitan\\\", Mr True-May, 65, replied: \\\"Well, we just do not have ethnic minorities involved. Because it would not be the English village with them. It just would not work. Suddenly we might be in Slough. Ironically, Causton [the town in Midsomer Murders ] is supposed to be Slough. And if you went to Slough you would not see a white face there.  \\\"We are the last bastion of Englishness and I want to keep it that way.\\\" \\u2026 Mr True-May gave the interview to promote the 14th series of the show, which has been sold to 231 territories around the world and continues despite the recent departure of central character DCI Tom Barnaby, played by John Nettles. Explaining the secret of its popularity, he said: \\\"When I talk to people and other nations they love John Nettles, but they also love the premise of the show. They love the perceived English genteel eccentricity. It's not British. It's very English.\\\"  Writing about the Brexit vote, Tyler Cowen (an American in favor of Remain) also notes the distinction between British and English:  As I interpret what happened, ultimately the vote was about preserving the English nation, and yes I use those last two italicized words deliberately; reread Fintan O'Toole. Go back and read English history. For centuries, England has been filled with English people, plus some others from nearby regions. Go visit Norfolk and also stop in Great Yarmouth, once described by Charles Dickens as \\\"\\u2026the finest place in the universe,\\\" and which, for whatever decline it may have experienced, still looks and feels like England. London does not.  There is a tension, for which there is no easy resolution, between wanting to have a society that is open and welcoming and inclusive to people and their traditions from around the world, and the preservation of what is seen to be special, exceptional, about the extant native culture. When Cowen wrote a book praising globalization in the cultural sphere, for all the ways it makes our lives more interesting, anthropologist Clifford Geertz excoriated him for his shallowness, his willingness to see unique cultures around the world swamped by global cosmopolitanism. I marvel at cosmopolitan cities - Toronto, New York, London. But not everybody does, and some folks are more happy with their town staying much the same as it always was.  Can protection of national culture, and desires to keep limits on immigration, veer into racism and xenophobia? Of course, and we see it all the time. American voters who want to 'take our country back'. In Canada, when a Quebec 'Leave' referendum failed to pass (barely) in 1995, the leader of\"}"
