"{\"uid\": \"ualrpublicradio.org.-post-two-way-congressman-french-hill-brexit-benghazi-gun-control\", \"text\": \"years, a House committee came out with its Benghazi report. Based on the information presented do you think then Secretary of State Clinton could have done things differently.  HILL: I think the Benghazi report when it came out, and I have read a summary of it I have not read the entire document, but what it confirmed to us is that it was a tragedy in which Americans including our Ambassador were killed. The real question for me was, where was the National Security Council, where was the President during these now famous 13 hours?  What it confirmed to me about Secretary Clinton is two things, one she participated in covering up the true story. It was a planned terrorist attack on the compound. Secondly it opened up the whole scrutiny over her email server in her home. But the real question I took away from the Benghazi report was, where was our national leadership, the Pentagon, the National Security Council, and the Central Intelligence Agency during those 13 hours? I look forward to studying the whole report but that remains to be the real question for me, that critical time.  KAUFFMAN: As early as next week, Speaker Paul Ryan says the House could vote on a counter terrorism package that includes some gun control ideas. The most popularly discussed one, would have new limitations for people that are on the no-fly list from buying firearms. Have you thought about that type of idea or how you'd vote?  HILL: I have, I have started looking at that. Senator Cornyn of Texas (R) proposed a similar provision in the Senate a few days ago. Effectively, it would fine tune any name that's been added to the no-fly list or the much, much bigger terror watch list which has over 500,000 people. By the way, most are not Americans. It would allow them to have some due process, so people would know why their name's on the list.  My gut is that's something I can support. I think it fine tunes the list. There are no Democrats or Republicans I know of that want terrorists to be able to acquire firearms of any kind. To me it is a good idea, I want to see the legislation when I get back to Washington and we will see what we can do.  KAUFFMAN: It sounds like you'd be opposed to any automatic, outright ban just because somoene is on one of these lists. But you are open to, it seems, that if you are on this list there needs to be some sort of further investigation if the government wants to then ban firearm [sales to those individuals].  HILL: I think that can be structured. Because these terror watch lists and no fly lists are not lists that are known or overseen by Congress.  KAUFFMAN: And it does not mean you are guilty of anything to be on the list.  HILL: That's correct and there have been a lot of mistakes including John Lewis, who led the sit in, was on the list at one time as was former Senator Ted Kennedy. This should give Americans pause that there is a list that has so many potential problems. I think the Cornyn idea gives due process, gives oversight to that list to make sure that it's more accurate and therefore can be used if someone's on it for a terrorist related reason they can not purchase a firearm.  KAUFFMAN: Are you worried when you vote on gun control issues, that if you vote for any kind of gun control - no matter how invasive or not invasive - that you will get pressure from groups like the NRA or constituents seeing any type of gun control as a cave in?  HILL: I do not think the NRA wants terrorists or dangerous people, people who are mentally ill to have firearms. I really think there is consensus on this if we protect the 2nd amendment and the 4th\"}"
