Innovative financing linked to energy, beneficial to individuals and communities, is breaking out even in the large corporate sector. In June, Marks and Spencer unveiled a scheme to crowdfund customer-owned solar for its stores, offering a 5% rate of return for customers who invest in it. This is not a good time to be a traditional utility, or a bank for that matter.  Withdrawal of investment from fossil fuels, another megatrend, continued in high places in June. Washington D.C. announced divestment of its $6.4 billion pension fund from oil, gas, and coal companies. A Swedish state pension fund divested holdings in an additional 19 fossil-fuel production companies, bringing its total to 38 companies eschewed (23 in coal, 15 in oil and gas).  Withdrawal of investment is not the only closing door for the fossil fuel incumbency. Pursuit of shale for fracked oil and gas is now laden with political risk. In June, Scotland and Germany voted in favour of bans on fracking.  As for the UN's Paris agreement on climate change, and the totally decarbonised energy world it aims at, the USA and India vowed to push early ratification of the treaty in June. Presidents Obama and Modi also agreed a $1 billion US - India pact on renewable energy. France became the first major nation to ratify. The EU smashed its 2020 emissions target (20%) six years early. The US, Canada and Mexico pledged to source 50% of their electricity from clean energy by 2025 en route to their Paris commitments. Norway set a new national emissions goal of 2030, bringing its target forward by 20 years. The parliamentarians of this oil and gas producing nation came close to banning fuel cars by 2025. Only the conservative element in its governing alliance voted against. Oslo voted to slash its emissions 95% by 2030, and to ban cars in the city centre by 2019 en route to that target.  As for the main setbacks in June, the list is much shorter. Shell chose to ignore the developments at Dong and Total, and put a revamped shale arm at heart of its growth strategy. Evidence emerged of Americans regaining their appetite for gas guzzlers: some 75% of EV and hybrid trade-ins are for gasoline cars. In Saudi Arabia, recent encouraging developments were devalued by an announcement to scale back plans for renewables in favour of gas.  Then there was Brexit. In the UK, populist rightist politicians, mostly climate-change deniers and people clearly willing to tell lies to get their way, won a referendum to leave the EU. Yet within a week, UK ministers approved a world-leading national carbon emissions target: a 57% cut by 2032 on 1990 levels. The EU target is 40% by 2030. Clearly, Brexit does not necessarily mean that a Conservative government will back off Paris commitments. It will not be able to hit them if fracked shale and nuclear remain the favoured options, and clean energy continues to be suppressed to make space for them, of course. But given the direction of travel so clear in the rest of the world, what chance would any government have of maintaining course with that?  Or indeed with Brexit itself, given the clear evidence of broken promises already emerging, and the long two years of exit negotiations required?\"}"
