Contact: Mike Krings, [email protected]  Paul Ryan's Obamacare Replacement Announcement  Kosali Simon, Ph.D.  Professor, Health Economist  Indiana University, School of Public and Environmental Affairs  \\\"Most would agree special interests had influence over shaping of the ACA, and that lobbying continues; however, it's likely that any replacement plan would face similar political realities. What makes me wonder is what political experts would think of the chance that a replacement plan would be immune to such criticism.\\\"  Bio: https://spea.indiana.edu/faculty-research/directory/profiles/faculty/full-time/simon-kosali.html  Website: https://www.iu.edu  Contact: Agata Porter, [email protected]  Turkish-Israeli Reconciliation Deal  Howard Eissenstat  Associate Professor of History  St. Lawrence University  \\\"Regarding the Turkish-Israeli reconciliation deal on June 27: Both Turkey and Israel benefit from the deal. Both have desire to limit regional isolation. For Turkey, this has been particularly acute. The agreement was a bitter pill for Erdogan, who feels strong personal sympathy for Palestinians. The failure to lift Gaza blockade significant. The deal points to fact that Erdogan, who is often framed as an ideologue, is capable of realism. It also points to his absolute control over local press, which is framing the deal as a Turkish victory.\\\"  Eissenstat is an expert in Turkish affairs. He speaks regularly to government officials, the press, and community groups regarding issues related to Turkey and the Middle East. He has also served as a country specialist on Turkey for Amnesty International-USA since 2006. He earned a Ph.D. in Near Eastern History from UCLA in 2007 and has been quoted in The New York Times, Los Angeles Times,\"}"
