The real number to fixate on: nearly 9 million people aged 16-64 were economically inactive-basically able to work but unable to find work. In the U.S., that bellwether number is even higher, with a record 94 million Americans out of the labor force in May (14 percent of the population in the UK, vs. 30 pervcent in the U.S.).  No one would argue that the job displacement is the result of \\\"radical Islamic terrorists\\\" or Syrian refugees. The culprit, broadly speaking, is globalization. Corporations can sell things more easily, in many new places, and can elect to manufacture goods wherever its most cost-advantageous. Where one economist will call this \\\"liberalization,\\\" political candidates, like Trump and Sanders, are calling this a rapacious hollowing out of the American manufacturing base.  The United States and Great Britain are among the wealthiest countries on the planet. That prosperity should underpin stability. Why then the tempestuous tectonic political shifts within each country? The Brexit and its origins will be studied for decades; Trump's rise, if it is still being taken seriously after a horrendous few weeks of campaigning, will only be viewed as a rebuke of the system if he manages to translate his iconoclasm into a viable political bloc beyond November. Nietzsche argued that mankind needed \\\"fixed horizons\\\" to live comfortably. Why then the willingness in Britain to upend their fixed horizon: a reliably sclerotic political experiment; and, in America, a reliably \\\"low energy\\\" Republican political party that has been struggling with shifting demographics for years and a good, solid answer to what happens when free trade takes American jobs offshore.  Trump has been willing to play liberal and progressive notes while running as a Republican. Leading into the spring, polls showed him and Clinton in a statistical tie, although that changed dramatically after he publicly castigated the federal judge presiding over his Trump University lawsuit, who was born in Indiana, for being \\\"Mexican.\\\" If he could cease the self-inflicted wounds, he might gain ground again.  Days after ousting Lewandowski, Trump delivered the biggest speech of his campaign at his hotel in New York. Full of the usual bluster, Trump's speech was chock full of the red meat that Hillary opponents had been waiting for. Trump's use of the teleprompter was notable, as was his restrained cadence. It gave the speech an entirely different look and feel as a result. One passage, toward the end, stood out for me:  They will have a chance to vote for a new agenda with big dreams, bold ideas and enormous possibilities for the American people. Hillary Clinton's message is old and tired. Her message is that things can not change. My message is that things have to change - and this is our one chance do it. This is our last chance to do it. Americans are the people that tamed the West, that dug out the Panama Canal, that sent satellites across the solar system, that built the great dams, and so much more. Then we started thinking small. We stopped believing in what America could do, and became reliant on other countries, other people, and other institutions. We lost our sense of purpose, and daring.  After declaring the American spirit moribund, Trump provides a litany of projects he would undertake to revive the American economy-the \\\"roads and airports of tomorrow\\\"-so that his speech starts to sound like the opening\"}"
