Originally published by the Birmingham Perspective:  See EA's full Britain and Europe coverage  Jenny Phillimore: Anti-Immigration Sentiment v. Immigration Realities  A devastating result and a dark day for Britain. It seems that a small majority of the British (or should I say English and Welsh) electorate were convinced by the hateful and, frankly, dishonest Leave campaign. The economic, political, social, and cultural consequences will be with us for decades impacting on our children and grandchildren.  Anti-immigration sentiment appears to have driven this result. Yet even the Leave campaign refused to promise that Brexit will deliver in terms of reducing net immigration, and one of the few points they conceded was that Britain's economy depends on migrants.  With a minimum of two years until we formally break with Europe, the inevitable turbulence in our economy may well be coupled with a spike in immigration as those contemplating coming to Britain take their last chance to do so. Meanwhile the three million EU citizens who reside amongst us - many doing the dirty, dangerous and difficult jobs that we do not want, others contributing their skills and knowledge - will feel increasingly disenfranchised with this result perceived as a rejection of them and all they have offered us.  Tim Haughton: The Effective Myth of \\\"Take Back Control\\\"  The reason why the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union can be expressed in three words: \\\"Take Back Control\\\". The Leave side used the alluring slogan repeatedly and relentlessly, whereas the Remain side never coined a simple and effective slogan.  Leave's slogan was vague and often masked an inaccurate description of decision-making in the EU. But in political campaigns what matters is not what is accurate, but what works.  \\\"Take back control\\\" combined a sense of a positive future ,albeit never defined or elaborated, with a sense of rightful ownership. Moreover, it helped to mobilize the anti-establishment support of voters who felt let down by their politicians.  The Brexit referendum, as referenda are so often, was only driven in part by the question on the ballot paper. Frustrated by the sense that the political class had failed them, many ordinary citizens took the opportunity to vent their fury.  Fiona de Londras: The Challenge of Forthcoming Negotiations  Once triggered, Article 50 will usher in up to two years of negotiation resulting in Brexit and a treaty on the UK's future relationship with the European Union  These negotiations are complex. The UK will have to determine what it wants; this will require domestic political leadership and clarity that is not currently in evidence. Furthermore, every member state will have to determine its priorities and bring these together in a common EU vision. In this, weighted votes will be used so that more powerful states have a louder voice than smaller states, although in practice consensus is preferred.  If the Treaty goes beyond matters of trade (which it likely will), it will have to be ratified by every other member state before finalisation. The European Parliament also has a veto option. That's 28 potential vetoes on this new, post-Brexit arrangement, and all held by parties with less at stake than the UK, with the possible exception of Ireland.  Thus,\"}"
