In that event, the UK's departure could spur the EU to develop in a way that might, paradoxically, have persuaded the UK to stay.  It is not at all apparent, however, that Germany, in particular, is ready to give up on the idea of \\\"ever closer union\\\", if not in those exact words. Merkel's first move after the UK referendum was to convene the six original members of the EU (then the Common Market), which offered a reminder of the early idealism. A revival of the political project, as envisaged at Maastricht in 1989, could speed evolution towards a two-speed Europe, with non-euro and non-Schengen countries, relegated to associate membership or similar, and others - such as Greece - leaving the euro to join them.  Such a pattern might make further expansion possible - even to the contested east, to include countries such as Ukraine. But there would be ambivalence in the countries of \\\"new\\\" Europe. On the one hand, they regarded EU membership as proof of their European credentials and would oppose any change that smacked of second-class status. On the other, they are loath to give up any of their sovereignty as newly restored nation states, as seen in their resistance to quotas for non-European refugees. So they might have no choice but to accept a two-tier Union, especially as the UK would no longer be there to champion their cause.  Which leads to a further conclusion. Whatever course the EU now takes, it is bound to look and feel rather different. Without the UK, it will be less Atlanticist and more Continental, in allegiances as in character. The US may maintain its presence and influence, but it will be as an outside power; the UK will not be there as bridge or proxy, and no amount of talking between Berlin and Washington will alter that.  The distinction between the EU and Nato, which had been lessening, could also sharpen again, as the UK leaves the former but remains a force in the latter, and Germany - with its queasiness about military engagements - becomes the ultimate arbiter in the EU.\"}"
