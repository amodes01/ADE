One opened to the world we knew, with all its qualities, faults, problems and promise; the other led to the complete unknown. We had no way of knowing what was behind it or what the consequences of choosing the second door would be (although many, many people - so called \\\"experts\\\" - said they thought they would be really, really bad). But, hey, we did it anyway. The only thing we had to lose was our dignity, stability, reputation, jobs, and international partners. Britain is now committed to a flight towards the side of a mountain, on a whim of recklessness that appears more fantastically dumb with each passing day.  But while we are racked by fears about the economy, social cohesion and the threat of political paralysis, there is another intangible we have foregone. We have lost any moral authority in the world. Our economy may recover and we may avoid the worst of societal breakdown (may being the key word) but as tragedy descends into a farce that could run for longer than Run For Your Wife, that most elusive of qualities will be the hardest thing of all to recapture. We are a laughing stock.  Firstly, we are an international joke because of who the Leavers chose to believe. There seems little to add to the commentary unleashed on Boris Johnson and Michael Gove over the past few days. We knew Johnson did not believe in Leave. We knew he was a chancer.

We knew recruitment would grind to a halt. We knew firms would make plans to relocate outside the UK. And yet enough people voted for Leave to prevail. We knew it because Leave called these suggestions \\\"scaremongering\\\", since revealed as \\\"fact\\\", that most lonely of nouns.  There were a lot of awkward conversations between children and their parents last weekend. Some even spilled into blind fury. The question the younger generation asked was \\\"Why?\\\" I do not know anyone who received a satisfactory answer. It has been, in part, an act of generational vandalism.\"}"
