US Ambassador Matthew Barzun, today's guest, also discussed the reality of trade post-Brexit.  He said that President Obama had been right to warn in April that Britain would go 'to the back of the queue' when it comes to negotiating trade deals.  Before voting for Brexit, the UK was at the front as it was part of the EU which is currently hammering out a major deal with the USA known as the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, or TTIP.

The interview was recorded after the referendum results and broadcast today.  However, others have claimed trade prospects with the US are looking hopeful, citing a bill calling for a new trade deal proposed by Republican politicians.
