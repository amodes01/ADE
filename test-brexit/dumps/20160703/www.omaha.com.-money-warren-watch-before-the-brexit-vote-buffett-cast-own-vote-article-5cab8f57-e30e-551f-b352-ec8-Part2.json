The project at the University of Texas at Austin studied the impact of reproductive health laws passed in Texas, gathering data from abortion providers, public records and interviews with women.  Their findings supported the argument that the Texas law in question, which required abortion clinics to be affiliated with hospitals, among other rules, created outsized burdens for women seeking a medical procedure that is legal.  Bloomberg said the court referenced TxPEP's findings in its decision, and the group's principal investigator, Dan Grossman, was an expert witness in the case.  The group was formed in 2011 after Texas legislators cut the state's family-planning budget, and then studied the effects of the 2013 law that was the subject of the latest ruling.  \\\"TxPEP was able to collect and analyze Texas-specific data about the impact of this law in real time,\\\" said Stephanie Toti, the Center for Reproductive Rights attorney who argued before the Supreme Court.  The research group has received $4.6 million in private funding and is applying for grants through 2019, the story said.  Bloomberg said the group's research showed that the law, although only parts were in effect because of a court order, required women to pay more, travel farther and wait longer for abortions, pushing some to obtain later abortions or to try self-induced abortions.  The Buffett Foundation has a long history of support for women's reproductive rights, including contributions that helped make the morning-after birth-control pill widely available.  Celebrating Kraft Heinz  There was plenty of criticism in Pittsburgh of Berkshire and its investment partner 3G Capital of Brazil when they began cutting costs after buying H.J. Heinz Co. in 2013.  Food processing plants closed, jobs went away, top management was replaced and the company became privately owned.  Then 3G and Berkshire bought Kraft Foods, merged it with Heinz and sold shares to the public, with the headquarters of Kraft Heinz Co. in Pittsburgh, not far from where Heinz was formed as a horseradish maker 147 years ago.  Now the Pittsburgh Business Times is celebrating Kraft Heinz as the city's largest publicly traded corporation, with $18.3 billion in annual revenue.  Heinz jumped to the top of the list over U.S. Steel and PPG Industries, the glass and coatings manufacturer, thanks to the Kraft merger, which nearly doubled its revenue, the Times said.  Dispute in Texas  Berkshire's ownership of McLane Co. and stock holdings in Walmart Inc. are in conflict in Texas.  McLane, which delivers a wide range of consumer goods to retailers nationally, is suing the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission for barring it from distributing alcoholic beverages in the state.  According to the beverage industry website Shanken News Daily, McLane argues that the commission was wrong in denying a distribution license based on its rule against overlapping ownerships among alcohol producers, distributors and retailers.  Berkshire owns McLane outright and holds a 2 percent stake in Walmart Stores.  McLane argues that other states prohibit such arrangements only if one tier in the alcohol business controls or influences the business activities of another. And other companies with similar ownership arrangements have been granted distribution licenses, McLane argues.  McLane has $48 billion in annual sales and distributes alcohol products in Colorado, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and Tennessee. A commission official declined to comment.
