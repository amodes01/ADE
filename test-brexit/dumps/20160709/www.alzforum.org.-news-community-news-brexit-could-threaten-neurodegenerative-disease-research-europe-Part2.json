In science, the U.K. reaps rich rewards from EU membership. U.K. scientists won 16 percent of all grants from the previous EU funding program, FP7, which ran from 2007 to 2013. During these years, the U.K. pulled in nearly \\u20ac6 billion in research funding alone, second only to Germany, according to a report by the tech firm Digital Science, which develops software tools for research. Universities, industry, and non-profits benefited from these awards and overall, nearly one-quarter of the funding for U.K. health and bioscience research comes from the EU, Digital Science reported.  This influx of funds has boosted U.K. science, according to a blog post by Mike Galsworthy, research policy consultant at the London School of Hygiene &Tropical Medicine, and Rob Davidson, data scientist at the online journal GigaScience. Galsworthy and Davidson lead the organization Scientists for EU, which campaigned for Britain to remain. They note that since joining the EU, both the output and the impact of U.K. research has grown steadily. The U.K. recently eclipsed the United States in the number of times its research was cited, largely thanks to its international collaborations, according to a separate Digital Science report.  Awards from the EU's current funding program, Horizon 2020, which runs from 2014-2020, also reflect this upward trend. For the first time, the U.K. overtook Germany in number of grants won. The U.K. and Germany each received nearly \\u20ac1 billion in funding in 2015, more than double the roughly \\u20ac400 million awarded to France, the next most populous country, Digital Science reported. Importantly, most Horizon 2020 grants are given out for international collaborations. \\\"The U.K. is currently in the driving seat of a global hub of research excellence that is larger than the U.S. in output size, growing faster than the U.S., and with a far higher rate of international collaborations,\\\" Galsworthy and Davidson wrote in their blog.  Post-Brexit, this progress is at risk. The U.K. lags behind other EU countries in domestic and industry contributions to research, leaving it particularly dependent on EU money, Digital Science notes. EU awards are likely to drop, regardless of how the U.K.'s relationship with the union will unfold, according to Galsworthy and Davidson's analysis. The Digital Science report supports this assessment, noting that only 7 percent of EU funding currently goes to non-member states, mostly to Switzerland and Norway. Norway receives about 10 percent of what the U.K. does, and grants to Switzerland dropped 40 percent from FP7 to Horizon 2020, Galsworthy and Davidson calculated based on the initial report from the latter program.  Could savings from EU contributions make up the shortfall, as Leave promoters promised? Galsworthy and Davidson consider this unlikely, noting that a probable economic slump in the U.K. following Brexit will more than wipe out those savings. In addition, there is no mechanism, or guarantee, that U.K. politicians will direct those funds to research. The Digital Science report agreed. \\\"The U.K.'s ability to collaborate on a global scale will inevitably be significantly impacted by reduced funding from the EU,\\\" it concluded.  Researchers interviewed by Alzforum wondered if even their current grants are safe. Tara Spires-Jones at the University of Edinburgh has a \\u20ac2 million EU grant due to start this year, but now does not know if she will receive it. \\\"These kinds of grants start the careers of neuroscientists in Europe,\\\" she noted.
