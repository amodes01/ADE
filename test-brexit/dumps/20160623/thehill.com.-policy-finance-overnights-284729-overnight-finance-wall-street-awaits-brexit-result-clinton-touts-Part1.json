A group of 20 current and former lawmakers, all Democrats, filed an amicus brief Thursday arguing a judge missed the mark ruling against regulators in a critical test of the law's powers.  {mosads}Among those signing on to the effort are former Sen. Chris Dodd (D-Conn.) and former Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.).  In the brief, the lawmakers argued that if a district judge's ruling stands, it would \\\"fundamentally undermine\\\" Congress's vision for Dodd-Frank as drafted. Both have since retired from office.  \\\"By substituting its own judgment for that of [regulators], the district court undermined not only the statutory scheme that Congress put in place in Dodd-Frank, but also the nation's ability to prevent another financial crisis,\\\" they wrote.

Ryan joined several Republican lawmakers by refusing to state a preference as British voters head to polls, while Obama has urged the nation to stay in the EU.  \\\"I am going to do exactly what the president did not do and not weigh in on this, and send the signal to our great friends and allies in Britain that we stand with them regardless of what decision they make,\\\" Ryan told reporters.

Alejandro Garc\\u00eda Padilla (D) said during a Thursday panel hosted by the progressive Center for American Progress Action Fund. \\\"We need the bill yesterday.\\\" I will tell you here about their concerns: http://bit.ly/28TzEhe.
