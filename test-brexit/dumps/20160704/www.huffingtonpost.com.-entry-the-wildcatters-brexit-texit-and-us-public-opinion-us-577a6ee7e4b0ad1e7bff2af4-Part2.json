When asked about the type of people who might want their state to secede from the union, more than 1 in 3 (34 percent) described these respondents as \\\"mostly patriots\\\" while slightly less than 1 in 3 (31 percent) described them as \\\"mostly traitors.\\\" Roughly equal percentages (17%) described them as neither patriot nor traitor or said they did not know what type of people they were.  In 2014, as Scotland debated independence from Great Britain, Reuters asked respondents \\\"Do you support or oppose the idea of your state peacefully withdrawing from the United States of America and the federal government?\\\" Narrowed down to \\\"your state\\\" only 24 percent supported withdrawing from the United States. As you might expect, there were differences across regions: 19 percent of Northeastern residents supported peacefully withdrawing from the United compared to 34 percent in the Southwest (including Texas) and 25 percent in the Southeast.  In follow-up interviews, respondents who indicated wanting to withdraw were less ideological than an expression of protest. In a 2009 story on the Sooner Poll, one of us (Keith Gaddie) similarly described the desire to secede as a \\\"take your ball and go home\\\" attitude. Support for secession reflects less of a desire to leave than a sense of aggrievement with the federal government.  Advertisement  Most recently, in wake of the #Brexit vote, Democratic polling firm Public Policy Polling asked voters about the possibility of Texas exiting the United States. Twenty-three percent of respondents in a national survey were supportive. Curiously though those most supportive (43%) were not Tea Party conservatives but respondents who self-identified as \\\"very liberal.\\\" Placed in this context, the results may reflect the polarization of American politics where increasingly we dislike those we disagree with.\"}"
