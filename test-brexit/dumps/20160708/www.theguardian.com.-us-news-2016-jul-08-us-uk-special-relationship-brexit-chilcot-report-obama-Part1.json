Subsequent British attempts to influence the conduct of the war, and crucially its disastrous aftermath, were nonetheless ignored, according to the report by Sir John Chilcot.  Faced with a slew of such embarrassing disclosures, US reporters wanted to know if their government had a response to a report that took seven years to produce.  No American official had read it yet, replied spokesman Josh Earnest. Instead he reacted with a phrase that is obligatory on the rare occasions when the subject of the UK comes up in the White House briefing room.  \\\"The United States and the United Kingdom have a special relationship,\\\" he said. \\\"I would expect that that relationship will remain special and strong.\\\"  For British diplomats - worried more than ever about their access to power after Barack Obama's dire warnings over Brexit - such platitudes might sound reassuring.  Obama had threatened that Britain would go the \\\"back of the queue\\\" in trade negotiations with the US if it left the European Union.  At an embassy drinks reception held at the UK ambassador's grand Lutyens-designed residence in Washington a week after the referendum, the feared loss of influence was on everybody's lips.  While Britain may have chosen to cut loose from Europe in search of a new identity in the Anglosphere, the phrase \\\"special relationship\\\" has rarely sounded more hackneyed on the other side of the Atlantic.  In part, Obama's polite froideur reflects competing demands for his affection. He calls France the \\\"oldest ally\\\" - a pointed reminder that Britain and America have not always been on the same side of the battlefield. Germany's Angela Merkel is the \\\"trusted partner\\\" and Canada the \\\"closest of friends\\\".  Among the dozens of world leaders he speaks to every month, it is the Chinese and Russians who tend to attract most media interest; the awkward Israelis the most political attention.    On Friday in Poland, during a Nato summit in which Britain remains a key player, Obama met the presidents of the European council and the European commission to discuss how Europe can maintain political cohesion after the UK exit.    Before arriving at the summit in Warsaw, Obama described the combined challenges facing Europe as \\\"the most important moment for our transatlantic alliance since the end of the cold war\\\".  \\\"The special relationship between the US and the UK will endure,\\\" he wrote in the Financial Times.\\\" [And] ... given the current threats facing Europe, I fully expect that Britain will continue to be a major contributor to European security.\\\"  \\\"The days ahead will continue to be difficult,\\\" he added. \\\"But, if the past seven decades teach us anything, it is that we will prevail if we stay united, strong and true to our democratic values. I am confident we will.\\\"  Though outgoing UK prime minister David Cameron was there too, to announce the deployment of extra troops to Nato's eastern flank, the White House had scheduled no private meeting with his beleaguered counterpart - spending time instead with Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg and Polish president Andrzej Duda, before flying on to Spain.  The Nato summit is, of course, a timely reminder of the enduring\"}"
