Lew will hold talks with counterparts in Paris, London, Brussels and Berlin during the July 11-14 trip.    The main subject will be \\\"continued economic stability and shared economic growth in the United Kingdom, Europe, and globally following the United Kingdom's referendum on membership in the European Union,\\\" the Treasury Department said in a statement.Lew also plans to meet business leaders and market participants to discuss the global economy.US President Barack Obama said last week that the Brexit vote raises \\\"longer-term concerns\\\" about global growth at a time of already weak economic output.And speaking at the NATO summit in Warsaw on Friday, Obama insisted that Brexit would not harm transatlantic unity, while also warning against a bitter divorce that would undermine security in the face of a resurgent Russia.\"}"
