In 2015, Germany, an EU nation, received over 400,000 asylum applications. The decision to allow in refugees only grew resentment, especially in light of the November 2015 Paris attacks, for which the Islamic State (IS) claimed responsibility, and the 2015-16 New Year's Eve sexual assaults in Germany, where the perpetrators were thought to have come into Europe among the flow of migrants and refugees. The sentiments only grew following the March 2016 bombings in Brussels-the location of the European Parliament.  Ballot Box or the Street  While our international norms of tolerance and human rights have evolved quickly since the 1945 establishment of the United Nations, the all too human mix of fear and tribalism remain unmitigated by the secular, liberal democratic world order that Western elites created in the 20th century. To this point, George Orwell's \\\"England Your England\\\" has been invoked in the Brexit debate, as the writer in 1941 wrote of \\\"the famous 'insularity' and 'xenophobia' of the English,\\\" particularly of the \\\"working class.\\\"  The occurrence of Brexit and the success of the Trump campaign-both deemed unprecedented and surprising-are born of greater social and economic narratives. The Western assumption that the world is destined to reach a more tolerant, equal and stable condition has been questioned by the success of those narratives among baby boomers. The insular proclivities of Western elders will lead to increased conflict along demographic lines, thus ensuring the self-fulfilling prophesy of tension between the West and the rest.  Democratic ideals are either preserved at the ballot box or lost in the street. In the face of growing economic inequality and fear of the \\\"other,\\\" insularity and fear have proved intoxicating for elders longing for an idealized past.  The onus then falls on the young to maintain faith in equality and toleration to ensure that liberal democracy remains a political reality. That reality of what the decisions to potentially choose a renegade presidential candidate, or to Brexit, will soon be revealed.
