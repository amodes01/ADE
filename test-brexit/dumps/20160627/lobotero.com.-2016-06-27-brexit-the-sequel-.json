"{\"uid\": \"lobotero.com.-2016-06-27-brexit-the-sequel-\", \"text\": \"Last week the world went batcrap crazy\\u2026..you see Britain voted to leave the EU and that set off days of speculation by the media\\u2026.especially who would be the next nation to choose the path of exit\\u2026\\u2026will it be Greece (my choice) or maybe Holland or Italy or Denmark\\u2026even France because they were never completely on board with the whole EU thingy\\u2026\\u2026  I could write about these wannabes but instead I would like to write about the \\\"exit\\\" thing here in the US.  I know what could I possibly be talking about, right?  Texas fools!  How many times has the subject come up in the news with Texas attached to it?  After the \\\"Brexit\\\" vote and all the news coverage and all the worthless speculation\\u2026.the whole secession thing has once again come up and Texas center\\u2026\\u2026.  Not content with celebrating liberty on July 4, a group of Texans has gleaned inspiration from Brexit-the UK's decision to leave the EU-with its own push for independence. The similar-sounding \\\"Texit\\\" movement, which gained significant support online Friday, is mainly being pushed by the Texas Nationalist Movement, which is basically the US soulmate of the UK secession initiative, according to its leader, David Miller, right down to the \\\"Leave\\\" campaign slogan that TNM says it's been using for years. With a motto of \\\"Texas First, Texas Forever,\\\" the group, like those behind Brexit, advocates for \\\"self-government,\\\" Miller tells News.com.au. \\\"At this moment, we do not enjoy that right,\\\" he says. \\\"The vast majority of the laws, rules, and regulations that affect the people of Texas are created by the political class or unelected bureaucrats in Washington.\\\" Vocativ decided to see how often the phrase \\\"Texit\\\" has been used in 2016 and found that online references spiked after the Brexit tally came in. Nearly 1,800 people tweeted something Texit-related in the hour of the announcement, with thousands more tweets following. Some of the posts are frighteningly serious, others are somewhat clever (cue the \\\"most likely to secede\\\" memes), and still others can not do anything but virtually shake their heads. It's not the first time some of the state's residents have vied for a breakaway: Right after President Obama's reelection, the White House turned down a petition signed by 125,000 people calling for Texas' freedom, Fox News reported. One Texit supporter tells the Guardian that a secession would bring back \\\"Texas solutions\\\" on issues such as gay marriage, gun rights, and immigration. (Here, a fewlegaltakes on secession rules.)  I am sick of hearing this crap from Texas\\u2026I say if they like then by God let us let them go\\u2026\\u2026but first build that Trump wall around the state and only put in a couple of in and out gates\\u2026.and then we will see just how serious these fools are about leaving the union\\u2026\\u2026  If they do not want to be part of the US then let the f*ckers go! I am sick of listening to these whiney twats\\u2026\\u2026let them GO!\"}"
