This means following the social-democratic ethos of pursuing ample social spending for health, education, training, apprenticeships, and family support, financed by taxing the rich and closing tax havens, which are gutting public revenues and exacerbating economic injustice. It also means finally giving Greece debt relief, thereby ending the long-running eurozone crisis.  Fifth, focus resources, including additional aid, on economic development, rather than war, in low-income countries.  All of this underscores the need to shift from a strategy of war to one of sustainable development, especially by the US and Europe.
