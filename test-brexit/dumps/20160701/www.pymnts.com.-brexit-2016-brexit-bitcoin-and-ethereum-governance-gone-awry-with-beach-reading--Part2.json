Hard to see why elected officials should not take that into account.  Suppose, for example, that a reliable poll did showed that the majority of people, including many of those who voted for Brexit, would not now. Would David Cameron, and others, really say that in face of proof positive that it was all a horrible mistake and misunderstanding that they must follow the will of the people because \\\"it's the democratic thing to do?\\\" Maybe Brexit should go forward based on the majority, but surely if it became clear that it was a mistake, and people recognized that it was a mistake. It would just as surely be nuts to codify a mistake - well, just because.  Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Other Virtual Currencies  So that brings me platforms, where I have studied governance extensively, and to virtual currencies that I look on in horror almost as much as I do the U.K. at the moment.  The lack of sound governance mechanisms has been one of the major obstacles to virtual currencies achieving their earlier promise.  Part of the problem is that there has been a tension between those interested in developing financial services innovation and those interested in political innovation. For some, virtual currency schemes, like bitcoin and Ethereum, are ways to pursue a libertarian agenda that eliminates central authorities. One way to do that is to make everything based on code and rules that humans can not interfere with. Others just want the damn thing to work so they can make alt-finance innovations on top of it.  This tension was highlighted with the Ethereum \\\"diversion\\\" of around $60 million from the DAO which broke the intent of DAO it not what was allowed by the code. Some, including the founder and leader, the brilliant Vitalik Buterin, wanted to reverse the diversion and had a way to do it. Others insisted that it was more important to avoid human intervention in the code.  I do not have a dog in this hunt. If people want to try to come up with political and social innovations that put the power in the code, so be it. I mean, after all, \\\"Person of Interest\\\" was a lot of fun to binge watch. And if people think that blockchain technologies can solve financial services problems they should go at it.  They can not do both though. If you are interested in financial services innovation, you probably do not want to bet the farm on a code-based system of governance. The notion that code could run a platform without human intervention is an unproven hypothesis whose truth is far from self-evident. And if you are interested in political innovation, I do not think you'd want to tie your future to people that are really interested in making money.  The other part of the problem, though, is that the founders to some of the leading virtual currency platforms do not seem to have thought through governance and have ended up with systems they probably did not intend.  The bitcoin virtual currency platform, for example, has to decide whether or not to expand the capacity of the network. That has resulted in a fierce battle between those for and against making the necessary changes to the code. The decision as a practical matter is up to a majority vote of transactions of one constituency within the community: the bitcoin miners. As the mining industry has evolved it has consolidated into a handful of players. As it turns out they are located in China, as described by Nathaniel Popper recently in The New York Times. In fact, four companies in China account\"}"
