Let us finally face the reality: a great majority of Europeans would never want to change the global world order! Western imperialism feeds them, makes them live much richer lives than anyone else on the Planet, while allowing them to work pathetically little. Sub-consciously, even those 'deprived' (what a joke!) European workers are deeply grateful to both Washington and to its gladiators. Their main demand is 'only' that 'ordinary Europeans should be getting an even better deal' than the one they are getting now. The commonly voiced grievance is that 'the deal was much better and more satisfying some 20 years ago than it is now'.  A better deal at the expense of 'the others', of course! But that is never mentioned.  'Less shillings for those at Goldman Sachs or HSBC, and a bit more for the \\\"common folks\\\" of Europe please!\\\"  All the rest is fine, really! \\\"Those Americans are actually really nice people. Like us, Europeans\\u2026 Hey, we went there last year, on vacation\\u2026\\\"  \\\"Oh, and remember: we do not want those bloody niggers and dirty Arabs in our cities and villages. They belong where they are, working for us, plundering their own lands so we can retire early, have access to free top medical care and fly to Southeast Asia to shag their young girls after we retire! You give all this to us, and more, or else: screw you, we will leave the European Union which does not care for its people, anymore!\\\"  Of course it is almost never articulated like that. But one has to read between the lines.  Or do my readers really think that those countries 'ready to follow the British example' actually care much about anything else other than their own selfish, petty interests?  I have talked to Greeks! I have talked to Spaniards. Most of them really hate 'foreigners'. Most of them know nothing, absolutely nothing; about what the West is doing all over the world. And frankly, they do not want to know anything.  And what do the East Europeans want? What about those \\\"poor\\\" and \\\"disappointed\\\" Czechs, Poles and Hungarians? Well, they also want more and more and more, as they always have done. Does anyone really believe that in the 1980s they were dreaming about 'freedom and democracy'? They were dreaming only about one thing: how to get rid of that Russian romantic idea of internationalism, and how to \\\"return to Europe\\\", read; how to stop helping the deprived and robbed parts of the world, and instead join the West - the real masters of the world - how to become part of the imperialist and neo-colonialist clique. Those nations, (let us be honest) are racist to the core, while almost all now members of the EU, are simply loving and admiring the United States! And they are showing open spite for the victims of Western imperialism.  How sorry can one really feel for all of them - for those European 'victims of the system'?  Forgive me, but I feel absolutely no sympathy for them! Perhaps it is because I have spent too much time in Congo, Kenya, Uganda, Southeast Asia, the Middle East, sub-Continent, Oceania, in Brazilian Amazonia and Peru; with those people that I consider are the 'real victims' of the system, of the globally enforced Western regime.  Therefore, I only feel growing outrage over the cynicism that covers like a thick blanket, those discussions about the British referendum (and all\"}"
