Armies of political commentators based on all continents are now feverishly trying to define to what extent the Brits got fooled, or how severely they will soon get punished for their 'bold move'.  All over Europe, the neo-Nazis and other right-wingers are celebrating, while most of 'liberals' are panic-stricken, running around like a herd of headless chickens, or howling at the moon at night in despair. The Euro-left (as pathetic and bogus as \\\"Euro business class\\\" on domestic European flights) is trying to put the recent referendum into some sort of philosophical perspective, blabbering something about a working class rebellion against the ruling elites.  Some Europeans are even blaming Mr. Putin for the outcome of the referendum, while others see behind the outcome of the vote the specter of an \\\"American conspiracy\\\" or even a \\\"Zionist lobby\\\".  Things are much more simple. A few million bigoted British voters, many of them old retirees and traditionally conservative, even racist bunch, got scared that their country was soon about to be invaded by unkempt hordes of refugees, or more precisely - by 'un-people' (to borrow from George Orwell's lexicon). While for others, the referendum became a way to express their frustration with the fact that the British working class has lately been getting an increasingly awful deal (read: an increasingly smaller cut from that enormous global loot plundered by both Europe and North America).  Do not search for any flickers of internationalism or traditional Left-wing ideals in the hearts of those who voted for \\\"Exit\\\". A great majority of the anti-EU warriors was simply demanding better benefits for itself (the \\\"British people\\\"), as well as \\\"Britain for the Brits\\\" (whatever that really means in this increasingly multi-racial nation).  Of course, the same can be said about the opposite camp! Those who were voting for remaining in the Union were doing so for strictly practical reasons.  Almost no commentator bothered to notice what was truly shocking about the entire referendum process: an absolute lack of progressive ideology, of internationalism and concern for the world as a whole. Both sides (and were there really two sides there) presented a fireworks of shallow selfishness and of pettiness. The profound moral corruption of the West was clearly exposed.  ***  Everybody in Europe now wants more, more and more. Screw austerity! \\\"Give us more benefits!\\\" Provide us with better wages, job security, and shorter working hours!  What is shocking is that (oh so innocently!) those demands are only made for the chosen bunch - for the Europeans and North Americans - not for the rest of the globe that is actually paying the bill\\u2026 And has been paying it for hundreds of damned years, suffering horribly from everything, from slavery, colonialist plunder, genocides triggered by Europe, terrorism against its liberation struggle, to the multi-national corporate looting.  It is high time to re-visit Fanon and Sartre, but in that comfortable, lazy and sclerotic Europe, no one seems to be in the mood for old, solid left-wing internationalist, anti-colonialist ideologies.  Yes, the global decolonizing process was never completed, but that is not on the agenda of those referendums-seeking Europeans. All they want is to have a better life, live longer, and to grow richer! They find it thoroughly unfair, that in the UK, France, Spain or Greece, those big corporations and banks are keeping most of the loot. They want their share. They want a much bigger share. They\"}"
