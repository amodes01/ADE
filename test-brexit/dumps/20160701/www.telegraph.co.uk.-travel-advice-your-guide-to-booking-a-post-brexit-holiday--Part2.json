And do not forget that even with the weaker pound, hotel prices, the cost of renting holiday cottages, and of eating out are still significantly cheaper in most European countries than they are here. A holiday in northern France, for example, can still be better value than the equivalent in Cornwall or Devon.  Consider all-inclusive holidays priced in sterling. That is the easiest way to protect the bulk of your holiday costs.  Do not gamble on currency. You stand as much chance of losing as of winning. Buy it when you need it. Using your credit card as much as possible is probably the most cost-efficient way of paying - as long as you pay off the balance each month.  Looking further ahead  In terms of passports, border controls, citizenship and freedom of movement, nothing will change until we are formally detached from the EU - which is unlikely to happen until at least autumn 2018. The biggest risks to travellers after that are the potential erosion of consumer rights which have emerged from EU directives, regulations and other arrangements. These protections may be particularly vulnerable because they are unlikely to be at the top of the agenda given the many pressing concerns which will have to be dealt with.  Perhaps the most crucial benefit of EU membership is our right to a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) which entitles UK citizens to free or reduced-cost treatment in other EU countries. It may survive, or we may find that countries like Spain, which has to fund a very high number of British residents there, oppose its continuation.  Read more: how the UK tourism industry intends to weather the Brexit storm  EU rules on compensation for airline delays and cancellations are very generous towards passengers. Too generous I have argued in the past - you can get hundreds of pounds in compensation for three hours' delay to a flight, even if the fare only cost you \\u00a320 in the first place. All flights in and out of the EU and on EU airlines, such as Ryanair, will still be covered automatically by the regulations, but there is a high chance this is one area of protection which will be watered down. What is most important is that passengers suffering overnight delays retain their rights to be properly looked after in a hotel.  Mobile roaming charges within the EU are due to be abolished entirely in 2017. We will still be members then, so presumably it will still happen and we should benefit for at least a year. But will it survive post 2018? I am not confident.  Lastly, but perhaps most importantly, the package travel regulations which protect your money in case your travel company goes out of business before you travel or if it happens while you are away ensure that you get home safely, stem from an EU directive. There is a lot of opposition in the travel industry because they add significantly to costs. A government keen to help may well be tempted to water them down.\"}"
