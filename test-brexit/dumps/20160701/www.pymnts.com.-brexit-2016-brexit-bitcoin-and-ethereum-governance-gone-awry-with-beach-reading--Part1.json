Committed anarchists read no further.  For everyone else, human communities have always needed rules to get the best out of each other - because we can make each other better off in so many different ways - and to prevent the worst of each other - because, face it, even good humans do bad things.  One of the rules is how to make the rules and change the rules. Should we have a dictator, let a simple majority of everyone in the community decide, representative democracy where the community delegates the decisions, or many other possible variants. I am not a political scientist, so I probably should not go too far out on a limb, but most communities, when given the choice of how they want to adopt rules, do not actually choose to go with majority voting - 50% plus 1 vote wins - as a routine matter.  The United States is a representative democracy for example. At least at the national level nothing gets decided by majority voting. And really consequential things, like amending the constitution, require a whole lot more. Neither is the United Kingdom. People vote for members of parliament and then they decide. Many other \\\"democratic societies\\\" function the same way. By and large, with representative democracy, the representatives do not cast their votes based on what a simple majority of the voters happen to want at any particular point in time.  Why is not simple majority voting adopted more? Especially now that we are all online it would seem to save a lot of money and we would not have to listen to windbag politicians anymore. There could even be an app for that so people could vote anywhere, anytime.  I suspect the answer is that sensible people over the years have recognized that it would make communities worse off over time, including whatever majority that happens to vote for something today. For one, majorities can change. Letting simple majorities decide things can lead to uncertainty and instability. For another, majorities can impose bad things on minorities. Since most people are in minorities on many issues, majority voting can make most people worse off.  Brexit provides a very good example of why simple majority voting should be used with care. Exiting the European Union is a very complex and costly process with uncertain outcomes. It poses a risk that the members of the United Kingdom will split off. Now, this is not an omelet. If the \\\"majority\\\" changed its mind it is possible that one could put all this back together again. But it would be difficult indeed. Since the present is known and future is not, there is a good reason not to change things unless one is very sure. Letting elected officials decide is one way to do it. Requiring supermajorities of people, or elected officials, is another.  Now, the thing about Brexit is that it seems like someone spiked the tea of the elected officials with something that made them really stupid, with perhaps Prime Minister Cameron getting the heaviest dose. Forget about suggesting that such a momentous decision was going to be left to a simple majority vote in the first place. Here's the situation now. The fact of the matter is that the referendum is not binding on Parliament. These elected officials, in a representative democracy, have to actually make the call. Yet Cameron and others are saying that they can not or should not and what's done is done. Like a teenager screwing up their face and saying \\\"fine.\\\"  Then there is the fact that the electorate now has evidence of the horrible consequences that are likely to result from\"}"
