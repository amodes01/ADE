    "text": "MANSFIELD \u2014 Despite volatility in the U.S. economy\u2019s near term due to the U.K.\u2019s decision to back out of the European Union, local financial advisors are preaching prudence.\n\nOn Thursday, June 23 the United Kingdom held a referendum vote to let voters decide whether they want to leave the EU or remain. Leave won by 4 percentage points with the final result showing 52 percent to 48 percent.\n\nSince current EU members represent around 7 percent of the world\u2019s population, the decision will likely cause a ripple effect, warranting close monitoring by financial advisors and personal financiers.\n\nAlso, according to a Merrill Lynch newsletter, the historic decision produced a historic reaction in markets. \u201cUpon the announcement of the result the British pound fell as much as 11 percent to its weakest level since 1985.\u201d\n\nLincoln Financial Certified Financial Planner Charles Hahn recently issued a letter to his clients that urged them not to panic, relating the Brexit situation to 2008\u2019s repression.\n\n\u201cAs the fall and recovery from the sub-prime crisis and other crises have shown, panic is not a strategy,\u201d Hahn wrote.\n\nHahn acknowledged the Brexit situation as one that will cause \u201cconsiderable volatility\u201d but estimates the U.K.\u2019s separation from the EU could take months or years before permanent changes are seen.\n\nBoth organizations predict high volatility in the short term.\n\n\u201cThe U.K. exit negotiations are likely to be messy and lead to a contraction in the country\u2019s economy, creating headwinds for the eurozone and the U.S.,\u201d reads a Merrill Lynch newsletter.\n\nHowever, the company advocates for a risk-neutral investment portfolio.\n\n\u201c(We) continue to emphasize diversification, high-quality and cash flow as major themes,\u201d it reads.\n\nModern Woodmen of America agree with the prudence message. Compliance Analyst Karen Mital said investors should stay the course.\n\n\u201cAlthough the \u2018Brexit\u2019 situation affects markets, don\u2019t make quick changes. My suggestion in this case is the same as it would be following other national or international events \u2013 stay the course and ride it out for the longer term. And when you have concerns, contact a financial professional to discuss your specific situation before making any decisions.\u201d",
