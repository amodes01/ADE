    "text": "The Scottish parliament will try to stop Britain from dragging it out of the European Union, first minister Nicola Sturgeon said on Sunday, as the five-million-strong country inched closer to breaking away from the United Kingdom. A man takes a copy of the Daily Record newspaper reporting on the pro-Brexit result of the UK's EU referendum vote and with an image of Scotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon.(AFP Photo)\n\nScotland and Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU while England and Wales voted to leave the 28-nation bloc in a historic referendum last week, rattling global financial markets and forcing prime minister David Cameron to resign.\n\nExperts are unclear if an agreement between all four UK nations --- Scotland, Northern Ireland, England and Wales \u2013 was mandatory before London sends a letter to Brussels under Article 50 of the Treaty of Lisbon, which stipulates a two-year period for any member-state to leave the EU.\n\nRead: Brexit: UK\u2019s Labour party in turmoil as key member sacked, others to quit\n\nBut Sturgeon said she will \u201cof course\u201d ask Scottish Parliament members to refuse to give their \u201clegislative consent\u201d to Britain leaving the EU.\n\nScotland's first minister Nicola Sturgeon speaks during an emergency cabinet meeting in Edinburgh, Scotland. (Reuters)\n\n\u201cIf the Scottish Parliament was judging this on the basis of what\u2019s right for Scotland then the option of saying look we\u2019re not to vote for something that\u2019s against Scotland\u2019s interest, of course that\u2019s got to be on the table,\u201d she said.\n\nScotland voted to remain in the UK two years ago but hours after the Brexit results, Sturgeon indicated a new referendum was likely. Experts said the 2014 referendum had hinged on the benefits Scotland\u2019s young economy would gain from Britain\u2019s EU membership.\n\n\u201cThe context and the circumstances have changed dramatically. The UK that Scotland voted to remain within in 2014 doesn\u2019t exist anymore,\u201d she told television channels.\n\nRead: British bracing for world economy to punish UK for \u2018Brexit\u2019\n\nSturgeon is keen that Scotland \u2013 that voted 62% in favour of EU -- remain in the international bloc and is seeking talks with Brussels to protect its interests that include unfettered access to European markets and investment from the continent.\n\nThe 45-year-old leads the pro-independence Scottish National Party, which has 63 out of 129 seats in the Scottish parliament, as well as 54 out of 650 seats in House of Commons.\n\nThe prospect of re-drawing UK\u2019s borders comes amid mounting desperation and regret among British residents after Friday\u2019s referendum voted 52%-48% to leave the EU after a bitter campaign that saw bitter campaigning over immigration, jobs and a sentiment of \u201ctaking Britain back\u201d.\n\nRead: Brexit: More than 2 million sign UK petition for new EU referendum\n\nBut hours after Brexit results delivered the most telling blow to European consolidation since World War II, regret appeared to grip the island as markets dived and the British currency was pounded to a three-decade low.\n\nMany \u201cleave\u201d supporters indicated they hadn\u2019t taken into account the seismic economic and political fallout of ending the UK\u2019s 40-year membership in the EU. Discontent also grew in Northern Ireland and Scotland with two polls showing a majority of Scots supporting independence.",
