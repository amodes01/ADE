    "text": "Some of the endless Brexit-result bashing from the New York Times on Saturday got personal. In her \"reporter\u2019s notebook,\" European culture correspondent Rachel Donadio didn\u2019t hide her contempt for the \u201copen xenophobia\u201d of the Leave side. Also, White House reporters Julie Hirschfeld Davis and Mark Landler sadly revealed just how much the voters of Britain have disappointed President Obama.\n\nDonadio wrote from Paris:\n\n.... the news stung. For me and others of my generation, this vote was about more than Britain\u2019s relationship with Europe. It signaled the definitive end of the era of transnational optimism in which I came of age: the \u201990s. Back then, we believed that interconnectedness was a strength. People wanted to study human rights law. Nationalism was out of fashion -- at least in Western Europe -- and weaponized Twitter didn\u2019t yet exist to galvanize political change. (Or rather, to take down institutions, not build them.)\n\nFor Donadio, it wasn\u2019t national sovereignty, distrust of unelected bureaucrats, or any abstract idea of freedom that had spurred British citizens to vote Leave, but \"open xenophobia.\" When she does acknowledge some of the EU's flaws, it seems the European Union\u2019s real woe boils down to a PR problem: It hadn't explained itself simply enough to the local dopes. Keep in mind this \"xenophobia\" charges is wnot contained in an Opinion-section piece, but in an article from a Times reporter in the news section of the paper:\n\nThis week, it wasn\u2019t Greece that was kicked out. It was Britain that voted to leave, after a campaign of open xenophobia. Leaving the euro isn\u2019t the same as leaving the European Union, but the differences are too technical for many people to parse. That\u2019s the problem. The European Union hasn\u2019t done a good job of explaining its purpose -- it\u2019s too opaque, too bureaucratic, too confusing -- and its slow handling of the debt crisis, especially in Greece, where it acted fast so French and German banks could cut their losses, but left Greece asphyxiated, had devastating consequences for all. Decisions made for short-term financial stability have led to long-term political instability. I\u2019m struck by how the critiques of Europe from the right and left wind up converging. The Democracy in Europe movement, begun this year by the leftist Yanis Varoufakis, a polarizing former Greek finance minister, hits some of the same notes as Nigel Farage\u2019s right-wing U.K. Independence Party, criticizing Europe as antidemocratic and less than transparent. Still, the right appeals to nationalism and the left does not. The right sells a nostalgic version of national identity that resonates viscerally but doesn\u2019t reflect reality, especially not for young people born into a Europe of Erasmus scholarships that let them study across borders, and EasyJet, which lets them travel around on the cheap.\n\nAlso on Saturday, White House reporters Julie Hirschfeld Davis and Mark Landler sadly revealed just how much the voters of Britain have disappointed President Obama, who previously pettily threatened Britain with trade consequences if it didn\u2019t fall in line and stay in the EU (it didn't work). The Times painted Leave voters as insular and narrow-minded, in contrast to Obama\u2019s sunny cosmopolitanism, in \u201cObama Acknowledges Loss but Says \u2018Special Relationship\u2019 Will Continue.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cBrexit\u201d vote runs counter to Mr. Obama\u2019s vision of open, interconnected societies, and it illustrates the frustrating cycle of his engagement with the world: \u201cAmerica\u2019s first Pacific president,\u201d as Mr. Obama has called himself, who tried to pull the United States out of the Middle East, now finds himself, near the end of his presidency, confronting a crisis in Europe fueled in part by the refugees attempting to flee the Middle East.\n\nThe Times liked Obama's smug summary so much that it repeated it in the text box: \u201cA vote that jars with the president\u2019s vision of open societies.\u201d\n\nMr. Obama acknowledged that much of the upheaval gripping American voters -- an angst that is propelling the campaign of Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee -- is driven by fear of technology-driven globalization and anger at job losses prompted by automation. Mr. Trump has exploited such fears, Mr. Obama told National Public Radio in December, calling them \u201cjustified, but just misdirected.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, even as he held a Google-sponsored virtual conference with entrepreneurs in Britain, Iraq, South Korea and Mexico, the president conceded that interconnectivity still makes many people uncomfortable. \u201cWe are better off in a world in which we are trading, and networking, and communicating and sharing ideas,\u201d Mr. Obama said before a panel discussion with Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook founder, on Friday.\n\nBesides the unelected, unaccountable bureaucracy in Brussels, it was the reams of regulations, the flood of refugees and the accompanying threat of social and sexual unrest that were making the British people uncomfortable, not some troglodyte technophobe fear of the modern world's \u201cinterconnectivity.\u201d",
