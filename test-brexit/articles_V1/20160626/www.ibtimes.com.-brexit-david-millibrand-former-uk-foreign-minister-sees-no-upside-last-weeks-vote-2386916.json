    "text": "Former British Foreign Secretary David Millibrand said Sunday the vote by Britain to leave the European Union will have an impact on efforts to maintain stability in the world.\n\nIn an interview on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Millibrand, president and CEO of humanitarian organization the International Rescue Committee, said he doubts, however, that efforts to schedule a second vote will succeed.\n\nBritain voted 52 percent to 48 percent for the Brexit from the EU, but then buyer\u2019s remorse sentiments set in. By Sunday afternoon, nearly 3.3 million people had signed a petition for a do-over.\n\n\u201cThis referendum was really an up-or-down vote for the European institution, which is undervalued,\u201d said Millibrand, indicating there's no upside to the decision. \u201cThe trouble is you have to live with the consequences. Populism is popular until it gets elected.\u201d\n\nMillibrand said Americans should realize the Brexit decision will have an impact on them as well, citing the strong economic links between the United State and Britain as well as the partnership for \u201cbuilding international stability.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe great danger now is that while the friendship will stay between the U.K. and U.S., the partnership doesn\u2019t have the same kind of influence or drive. And that\u2019s what worries many of us,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cWhen [Russian President] Vladimir Putin is cheering, you know you\u2019ve got a problem in the international system.\u201d\n\nMillibrand said it\u2019s too early to say whether a second referendum will be scheduled, and he was appalled people voted first and then researched exactly what they had voted against after the results were revealed. (Google reported Friday a 250 percent increase in queries such as \u201cWhat is the EU?\u201d)\u201cIt is terrifying that people voted to leave an institution and are then suffering buyer\u2019s remorse. \u2026 The challenge now is for Britain to show the common sense, the practicality, the sense of purpose that has traditionally been associated with us will continue to carry through,\u201d he said, adding he doesn\u2019t think the government can ignore the result.\n\nMillibrand acknowledged the whole campaign was colored by controversy over immigration. Concerns in Britain center mostly around immigrants from Eastern Europe. He said Britons must realize they can\u2019t have it both ways \u2014 access to the EU and a block on immigration.\n\nSen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d he is upbeat about Brexit, adding it\u2019s exciting to see Western civilization \u201crealize that the direction we\u2019re going is not a good direction.\u201d Corker, who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said he thinks the vote will draw America and Britain closer.\n\n\u201cThere is massive resentment throughout Europe and the U.K. and into the United States about a global economy that works very, very well for large multinational corporations who are able to shut down in this country to go to China or Mexico and hire people for very low wages,\u201d Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont said on \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a global economy that is not working in many ways for the middle class or working families. \u2026\n\n\u201cWhat ordinary people are saying is give us an economy that works for all of us and not just the people on top, and I think to a significant degree that\u2019s what this Brexit vote was all about.\u201d",
