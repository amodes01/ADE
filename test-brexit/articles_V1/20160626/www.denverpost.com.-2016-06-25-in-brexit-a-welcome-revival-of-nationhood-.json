    "text": "The Leave campaign won the referendum on withdrawing Britain from the European Union because the arguments on which the Remain side relied made Leave\u2019s case. The Remain campaign began with a sham, was monomaniacal with its Project Fear, and ended in governmental thuggishness.\n\nThe sham was Prime Minister David Cameron\u2019s attempt to justify Remain by negotiating EU concessions regarding Britain\u2019s subservience to the EU. This dickering for scraps of lost sovereignty underscored Britain\u2019s servitude and achieved so little that Remainers rarely mentioned it during their campaign.\n\nProject Fear was the relentless and ultimately ludicrous parade of Cassandras, \u201cexperts\u201d all, warning that Britain, after more than a millennium of sovereign existence, and now with the world\u2019s fifth-largest economy, would endure myriad calamities were it to end its 23-year membership in the EU. Remain advocates rarely even feigned enthusiasm for the ramshackle, sclerotic EU. Instead, they implausibly promised that if Brexit were rejected, Britain \u2014 although it would then be without the leverage of the threat to leave \u2014 would nevertheless somehow negotiate substantially better membership terms than Cameron managed when Brexit was an option.\n\nVoters were not amused by the Cameron government\u2019s threat of what critics called a Punishment Budget to inflict pain on pensioners (e.g., no more free bus passes) and others because Brexit might cause GDP to contract 9.5 percent and home prices might plummet 18 percent. Voters did not like being told that they really had no choice. And that it was too late to escape from entanglement in the EU\u2019s ever-multiplying tentacles. And that the very viscosity of the EU\u2019s statism guarantees its immortality.\n\nVoters chose the optimism of Brexit. Sixty years after Britain\u2019s humiliation in the Suez debacle, Britain has a spring in its step, confident that it will flourish when Brussels no longer controls 60 to 70 percent of the British government\u2019s actions. Britain was last conquered by an invading army in 1066. In 2016, it repelled an attempted conquest by the EU\u2019s nomenklatura.\n\nBy breaking the leftward-clicking ratchet that moves steadily, and only, toward more \u201cpooled\u201d sovereignty and centralization of power, Brexit refutes the progressive narrative that history has an inexorable trajectory that \u201cexperts\u201d discern and before which all must bow. The EU\u2019s contribution to this fable is its vow to pursue \u201cever-closer union.\u201d Yes, ever.\n\nTo understand why Brexit could and should be the beginning of an existential crisis for the EU, look across the English Channel, to France. There, King Clovis recently was invoked 1505 years after his death in 511.\n\nBefore a particular battle, Clovis promised that if the God to whom his Christian wife prayed would grant him victory, he would become a Christian. He won the battle and converted. Recently, Nicolas Sarkozy, France\u2019s once and perhaps future president, said France was \u201cborn of the baptism of Clovis,\u201d it has a Christian tradition and remains \u201ca country of churches, cathedrals, abbeys and shrines.\u201d\n\nActually, 71 percent of the French say religion is unimportant to them and fewer than 4.5 percent attend weekly church services. But Sarkozy was aligning himself with the palpable desire in France and elsewhere in Europe to resist the cultural homogenization that is an intended consequence of EU\u2019s pressure for the \u201charmonization\u201d of the laws and policies of its 28 disparate member nations.\n\nIn Paris these days there are marches by a group called Generation Identitaire, described as the \u201chipster right.\u201d It aims to rally \u201cyoung French and Europeans who are proud of their heritage.\u201d A recent statement on its website declared that \u201cIslamist attacks\u201d and \u201cthe migrant invasion\u201d made 2015 \u201ca turning point in the history of our country.\u201d The statement continued: \u201cThe French have been silent for too long. \u2026 It is time to show our determination to live on our land, under our laws, our values and with respect to our own identity.\u201d Sarkozy, the son of Greek and Hungarian immigrants, sympathizes.\n\nEuroskepticism is rising dramatically in many EU nations. There might be other referendums. Or the EU might seek to extinguish this escape mechanism. A poll in Sweden indicated that it might follow Britain out. In France, there could be a campaign for Frexit.\n\nSuch was the Remain side\u2019s intellectual sloth, it wielded the threadbare aspersion that advocating withdrawal amounted to embracing \u201cisolationism.\u201d Actually, Brexit was the choice for Britain\u2019s international engagement as a nation. The revival of nationhood is a prerequisite for the reinvigoration of self-government through reclaimed national sovereignty. Hence June 23, 2016, is now among the most important dates in post-war European history.\n\nE-mail Washington Post Writers Group columnist George F.
