He can just say it,\u201d another said.\n\n5 things we learned from a night that shook Europe\n\nIn his resignation statement following the vote to leave the EU, Mr Cameron said: \u201cA negotiation with the European Union will need to begin under a new Prime Minister, and I think it is right that this new Prime Minister takes the decision about when to trigger Article 50 and start the formal and legal process of leaving the EU.\u201d\n\nMr Cameron will attend the European Council in Brussels on Tuesday to inform the other 27 national leaders of the outcome of the referendum.\n\nHowever, a council spokesman said Mr Cameron must be explicit that he is triggering Britain\u2019s exit, if he wishes to formally begin proceedings.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe notification of Article 50 is a formal act and has to be done by the British government to the European Council.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt has to be done in an unequivocal manner with the explicit intent to trigger Article 50.\"\n\nHe added: \u201cNegotiations of leaving and the future relationship can only begin after such a formal notification. If it is indeed the intention of the British government to leave the EU, it is therefore in its interest to notify as soon as possible.\u201d",
