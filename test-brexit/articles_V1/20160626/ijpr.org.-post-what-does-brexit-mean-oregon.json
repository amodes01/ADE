    "text": "As the U.K. decides to leave the European Union, the question in Oregon is: What does it mean for the state?\n\nOregon State University assistant professor Alison Johnston said the main issue is stock market volatility.\n\n\u201cI think your big Oregon companies that I know of, companies like Nike, and Intel and Columbia, I don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to be impacted too much,\u201d Johnston said.\n\nAdidas released a statement to OPB, saying it regrets the U.K.\u2019s decision, but expects the demand for sporting goods to continue.\n\nThe U.K. ranks 12th among the top countries for Oregon exports: About 2 percent of the state\u2019s exports go there. For comparison, 24 percent of exports go to China.\n\nJohnston said there's also a plus side for Oregonians.\n\n\"The good news I guess for anybody doing any traveling in the U.K. anytime soon, they\u2019re going to get a big bang for their buck, because the pound is going to be very down in value,\" she said.\n\nMatt Dunham / Just 2 percent of Oregon exports go to the United Kingdom, as compared to 24 percent to China.\n\nCopyright 2016 Oregon Public Broadcasting",
