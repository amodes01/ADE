    "text": "US officials travelling to Rome with the secretary of state told reporters on the flight that two stops had been added to his European itinerary at the last moment.\n\n\u201cTomorrow we\u2019ll go to Brussels and then on to London,\u201d one official said.\n\nWashington was dismayed last week when British voters chose to leave the European Union, a decision that triggered global economic uncertainty and fears other EU members will follow suit.\n\nPresident Barack Obama had made clear his concern about the Brexit referendum, and now US officials are scrambling to try to stop the political crisis harming Western unity.\n\nI will travel to Brussels & London on Monday to reaffirm our unwavering partnership w/ the EU & UK. Will meet w/ @FedericaMog & @PHammondMP \u2014 John Kerry (@JohnKerry) June 26, 2016\n\nKerry arrived in Rome on Sunday on a planned visit to have lunch with Foreign Minister Paolo Gentiloni and a working dinner with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nBut officials on his flight said that on Monday he would fly on to the EU headquarters in Brussels for crisis talks with EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini.\n\nMogherini had been expected to meet Kerry in Rome on Sunday, but she was busy dealing with the fallout of the dramatic vote, which stunned European and world leaders.\n\nFrom Brussels Kerry will continue to London to see Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond and other officials from outgoing British Prime Minister David Cameron\u2019s government.\n\nThe two senior diplomats are expected to hold a joint news conference before Kerry leaves to return to Washington.\n\nObama and Kerry have been at pains to insist the vaunted \u201cspecial relationship\u201d between Washington and London will survive what US officials view as the Brexit debacle.\n\nDramatic referendum\n\nBut Washington foreign policy experts are all but unanimous in assessing that the White House will increasingly turn to core EU allies to defend its interests on the continent.\n\nObama himself, on a visit to London last month, warned British voters that their nation would go \u201cto the back of the queue\u201d for a US trade deal if they voted \u201cout.\u201d\n\nUS officials are also keen to help London\u2019s divorce from Brussels go through smoothly without further inflicting further damage on skittish world financial markets.\n\nBut they, like many EU capitals, are also concerned not to allow Brexit to serve as an inspiration for eurosceptic forces in other members such as Italy or The Netherlands.\n\nThe London visit will be the first by a senior US official since Thursday\u2019s dramatic referendum, when voters demanded Britain leave the world\u2019s richest trading bloc.\n\nKerry\u2019s trip had originally been planned as an opportunity to meet Netanyahu and discuss regional security and the stalled Israel-Palestinian peace process.\n\nBut US officials played down the chance of any concrete progress, insisting that the pair meet regularly and that no new initiative would be on the table.",
