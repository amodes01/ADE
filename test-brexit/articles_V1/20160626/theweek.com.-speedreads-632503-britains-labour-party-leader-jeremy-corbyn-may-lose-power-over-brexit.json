    "text": "Britain's Tory prime minister, David Cameron, announced his resignation following the Brexit vote \u2014 but now it looks like Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, who supported remaining in the EU, may lose his position of power as well.\n\nCorbyn fired Hilary Benn, his shadow foreign secretary, Saturday evening, and another one of Corbyn's senior advisers on the shadow cabinet soon resigned. \"I do not believe you have the capacity to shape the answers our country is demanding,\" former shadow health secretary Heidi Alexander wrote in her public resignation letter to Corbyn, \"and I believe that if we are to form the next government, a change of leadership is essential.\"\n\nAdditional resignations are expected amid rumors of a open party coup to oust Corbyn in the near future. With Alexander, Corbyn's opponents argue his failure to prevent Brexit bodes poorly for attempts to reclaim power in Parliament.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.
