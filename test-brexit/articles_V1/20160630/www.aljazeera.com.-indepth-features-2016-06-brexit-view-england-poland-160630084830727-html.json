    "text": "In last week\u2019s referendum, Boston recorded the highest percentage of votes in the UK to leave the EU.\n\nBoston, United Kingdom \u2013 At first glance the town of Boston, on the east coast of England, looks like any other old English market town. A large parish church dominates the skyline and locals wander through the rain across cobbled streets and narrow passageways.\n\nBut, away from the main square, across a bridge over the River Witham and towards nearby West Street, the town starts to look and feel decidedly different.\n\nOn a 350-metre stretch of road one can find a Baltic food supplier with an EU flag on its shopfront, a Polish mini-mart beneath a flat festooned with St George\u2019s cross flags and an information centre offering currency transfers and benefits advice to new arrivals.\n\nAccording to the 2011 census, Boston, dubbed \u201cLittle Poland\u201d by some locals, had a higher proportion of Eastern Europeans than anywhere in England and Wales.\n\nSince the European Union expanded to include 10 new countries in 2004, thousands have flocked to the small, sleepy, East Midlands town, drawn to jobs in fields and factories and comparatively higher wages. Between 2001 and 2011, Boston\u2019s foreign-born population rose by 467 percent, the highest increase in England and Wales.\n\nRising immigration\n\nWhile some local farmers have benefited from the supply of cheap migrant labour, many locals are unhappy. In last week\u2019s EU referendum their feelings were clear, with 75.6 percent voting to leave \u2013 the highest percentage in the UK.\n\nLike in many places across the country, the decisive issue here was immigration.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t sustain the amount of people we\u2019ve got here,\u201d says Nick, a 61-year-old night porter at the New England Hotel who voted to leave and gives only his first name.\n\n\u201cEverywhere you go, public services are being cut and yet the number of migrants is increasing. The amount of alcohol consumed in the town is probably five times what it was 10 years ago. They drink on the streets, they urinate up the walls, up the trees, in corners, they defecate in the bushes in the park. It might be good for their country but we\u2019re a civilised country and it doesn\u2019t go down well,\u201d he said.\n\nJonathan Noble, a 62-year-old local councillor with the far-right, anti-immigration UK Independence Party (UKIP), says his group had an \u201coverwhelming degree of public support\u201d during months of campaigning in the town.\n\n\u201cThere is competition for jobs which has had the effect of depressing wages in a low-wage area,\u201d he says, sitting in a tweed jacket, shirt and tie outside Boston\u2019s White Hart Hotel.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s too much pressure on local schools, tremendous pressure on GP surgeries, pressure on housing. People that want to get on the council housing list are competing with foreign nationals,\u201d Noble says. \u201cAll these things combine.\u201d\n\nImmigration or exploitation?\n\nNot everyone thinks that immigration is to blame for the town\u2019s problems, however. In a richly decorated council chamber at Boston Town Hall, local Labour councillor Paul Gleeson says migration has massively benefited the area despite the large vote to leave.\n\n\u201cWe now have many more people working here, our shops aren\u2019t empty and our schools are achieving well,\u201d he says. \u201cThe only problem we have is that these people are foreign, and locals don\u2019t like that.\u201d\n\nI hope the government doesn't start treating us like second-class citizens. That was my first feeling after the referendum. It was a loud signal that we are not welcome any more. by Karol Sokolowski\n\nWhile Gleeson admits there are problems, he says population change has been badly managed by the local authority and businesses have been free to exploit migrant workers and depress wages.\n\nGleeson thinks that \u201cthe failure of authorities to react quickly enough to the change in population meant that local communities were hurt.\n\n\u201cBut that was nothing to do with the EU and nothing to do with where the workers came from.\n\n\u201cThey were needed because we had the work for them. It isn\u2019t immigration, it\u2019s exploitation of new workers that has affected people in this town.\u201d\n\nAt Swojskie Jadlo, a family-owned Polish restaurant near West Street, 30-year-old Karol Sokolowski says he doesn\u2019t understand why Leave voters have such a problem with the Polish community.\n\nBefore opening the restaurant, Sokolowski says he toiled in local factories where many of his friends are still employed.\n\n\u201cMe and my family and most of my friends are working really hard,\u201d he says from behind the counter.\n\n\u201cMost don\u2019t take benefits. If somebody says we as Polish people are stealing jobs or taking benefits they should look around and see that we are working.\u201d\n\nIncrease in racist attacks\n\nLithuanian community leader Jurate Matulioniene says that the media is partly to blame for Boston\u2019s large percentage of Leave voters. Matulioniene arrived in the UK with her daughter six years ago and set up the Boston Lithuanian Community, which puts on events and meets with other local groups. But she says their work receives little attention.\n\n\u201cIt was about newspapers and the media,\u201d she says, sitting under the shadow of St Botolph\u2019s Church, one the largest parish churches in the UK, and pulling nervously on the drawstring of a sweatshirt.\n\n\u201cWe have been working hard for integration. We try to organise events together. We always ask the English community. We\u2019ve done lots of good things but not so many articles have been published,\u201d Matulioniene says.\n\nSince last week\u2019s result, a surge in street harassment has been reported across the UK.\n\nIn Hammersmith, west London, racist graffiti was daubed on a Polish community centre and in Huntington, near Cambridge, leaflets saying \u201cLeave the EU/No More Polish Vermin\u201d were posted to the houses of Polish residents.\n\nREAD MORE: Tears, joy and a resignation as UK votes for Brexit\n\nFinding similar stories in Boston isn\u2019t hard.\n\nAccording to a despairing Gleeson, Boston post-Brexit is now more fragmented than ever.\n\n\u201cWe have let the genie out of the bottle,\u201d Gleeson says. \u201cThey right now feel that they have this sort of carte blanche to be foul and obnoxious to people.\u201d\n\nAt Swojskie Jadlo, Sokolowski says a number of his friends working in the town\u2019s food-processing factories have faced hostility since the referendum.\n\n\u201cNobody has been racist to me personally but I\u2019ve heard things from a few of my customers who work in the factories like \u2018After the referendum you can pack up and go home\u2019.\u201d\n\nStanding by the bar, one of Sokolowski\u2019s customers, a 34-year-old Polish factory worker who gives his name as Patrick, says his wife was accosted on the street on the day of the referendum.\n\n\u201cA man told her to stop using a foreign language,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m afraid about the English people attacking. People are becoming aggressive for no reason. I am worried about my future and my family\u2019s future.\u201d\n\nWhat happens to the legal status of EU migrants already living and working in the UK is now unclear. UKIP councillor Jonathan Noble says fear of repatriation is \u201cnonsense\u201d but like others across the country, Boston\u2019s diverse migrant community is now deeply uncertain.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure what is going to happen,\u201d says Sokolowski.\n\n\u201cI hope the government doesn\u2019t start treating us like second-class citizens. That was my first feeling after the referendum. It was a loud signal that we are not welcome any more.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very hard to say right now how things are going to change,\u201d adds Jurate Matulioniene\u2019s 19-year-old daughter, Egle Matulionyte.\n\n\u201cThere was no post-Brexit plan set up. As an individual you want to know about your future, especially if you have lived here for five years and have paid taxes. But there is no stability and at the moment you don\u2019t know what tomorrow will bring.\u201d\n\nAt evening mass on Wednesday at St Mary\u2019s Roman Catholic Church, John Wakefield, a 60-year-old caretaker, prepares for a service led by Polish priest Stanislaw Kowalski.\n\nOne of Boston\u2019s few residents who voted to remain in the EU, Wakefield says the Polish community, who helped to revive this once empty church, has been badly affected.\n\n\u201cWe had a mass in Polish on Friday night, the day after the referendum,\u201d he says. \u201cThey were all very emotional and just bewildered, not because anything legal had changed but they were feeling that England was saying you are not welcome. You could see that was hurting them badly. Some of the women were in tears.\n\n\u201cTo be an immigrant is not an easy situation,\u201d adds Kowalski, sitting on a church pew as the first of the congregation begins to arrive.\n\nHe hopes that the wider Boston community finds \u201cpeace, cooperation and respecting differences\u201d, he says before walking towards the altar, kneeling down on both knees and folding his hands in prayer.",
