    "text": "The safe havens are not so safe after all.\n\n\"It is time to ditch the fiction of risk-free developed markets,\" says Jan Dehn, head of research for the Ashmore Group in London. A couple weeks ago, Dehn told me in an informal conversation that the U.K. referendum would result in it staying with the European Union. Instead, it resulted in a \"Brexit\" and the resulting market turmoil has shown once again that despite being the world's safe haven, the core economies have rattled the world since the Great Recession of 2008. \"Investors should accept the facts and reduce their remaining exposure to developed markets,\" Dehn said.\n\nAs if to underline the point, the International Monetary Fund cut its forecast for U.S. growth recently to\n\n2.2% this year, down from 2.4% in its April 2016 World Economic Outlook. The IMF cited headwinds including the strong dollar and weak corporate investment. As for the U.K., it seems clear the economy will at least stall, despite newly resigned Prime Minister David Cameron's comments last week that the fundamentals of the economy were still strong.\n\nIn a worst case scenario, corporate investment in the E.U. will be postponed, possibly for years until the U.K.\u2019s new relationship with the Union is clarified. Also, given the chaos unleashed within the main political parties in the U.K. all investment which depends on government spending is likely to be postponed. Investments that are sensitive to the economic cycle are likely to be postponed as well as foreign sources of capital from outside the E.U., mainly China.\n\nAs usual, the only backstop left is the central banks. Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen issued a dovish\n\nmessage in her testimony to Congress pre-Brexit, highlighting \u201cconsiderable uncertainty\u201d in the outlook. Imagine her thoughts today. Some in the market suggest the U.S. might even see a rate cut. For sure, the 10 year is going under 1 1% if chaos overtakes the E.U.\n\n\"The big winners from the Brexit vote are likely to be nationalists across the rest of the developed world,\" Dehn says.\n\nOver $2 trillion in global market capitalization has been wiped out since Brexit, along with the dramatic decline in U.S. and European financials, and the surge in credit default swaps pricing for European sovereign debt. To say that the risk environment has worsened is an understatement. To point out that all that risk is stemming from the heart of Western capitalism is blasphemy. The risk is global markets is not China consuming less iron ore, though that is indeed part of it. Nor is it Russian \"totalitarianism\" or Latin America's imploding, corrupt governments ransacking entire nations like Mexico, Venezuela and Brazil. The problem is the U.S. and Europe. The crisis starts and ends there.\n\nThe pressure on central banks to maintain or even reopen the spigots of money creation will persist. Fed funds probabilities currently suggest a rate cut is nearly three times more likely than a rate hike by February 2017.\n\n\"Unfortunately, hopes that Brexit might shock Berlin & the E.U. into better policy making have been dealt a serious blow by recent pronouncements,\" says Vladimir Signorelli, founder of macro trade research firm Bretton Woods Research LLC in Long Valley, New Jersey. \"Nowhere do we find a strong call for the E.U. to rethink the policies of open immigration and economic austerity \u2013 the twin engines that arguably drove Brexit to victory. And because President Obama supported both modes, there are no helpful voices from the U.S. leadership to encourage a more productive response to last week\u2019s referendum.\"\n\nBloomberg\u2019s Leonid Bershidsky noted on Monday that French and German Foreign Ministers Jean-Marc Ayrault and Frank-Walter Steinmeier have emerged with a 9 page document proposing a new direction for the E.U., a United States of Europe so to speak. What took them so long? Or better yet, what on Earth are they thinking?\n\nThey outlined a new course of action on security, immigration and building a fiscal union for member states. The arrangement is likely a non-starter. Angela Merkel, the defacto Queen of Europe, is simply not on board with this kind of program.\n\nThere is money to be made in all this.\n\n\"There are obvious longer term risks, not the least of which is the implication for the success of similar popular movements in other countries in Europe,\" say Los Angeles based TCW Group's emerging market fund managers led by Penelope Foley in a note on Friday. \"Our take away from this event is that global growth will be slower and developed market central banks will increase their accommodative policies. We are in a lower for longer rate environment...and emerging markets will be a longer term beneficiary,\" she says.\n\nAs the core economies stagnate and crumble under the weight of one crisis to the next, the poorer nations of the world are still left picking up the pieces. Most of the world's wealth is in the developed world. Most of the world's major multi-nationals are from there. If they're in trouble, they are unlikely to invest in China, or Brazil. That's not a hard and fast rule, but it's a problem. Emerging markets are still tethered to the core. And the core is weighing them down.\n\nCheaper capital could mean a turning point in relative growth rates for emerging markets versus the U.S. and Europe, leading to a near term buying opportunity for securities -- both equity and debt. A lot of that will depend on China. And major emerging markets like Brazil and Russia coming out of a two and a half year slump. Either way, there's not much in the way of conviction for investors, other than value hunters and cowboy hedge funds that like to play markets undergoing \"regime change\".",
