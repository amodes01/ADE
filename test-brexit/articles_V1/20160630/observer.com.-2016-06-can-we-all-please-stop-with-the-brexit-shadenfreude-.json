    "text": "When Americans woke up Friday morning to Brexit, their first reaction was surprise. Not only was a clear win for Leave entirely unexpected, but this was, I suspect, the first most Americans had heard about this thing called \u201cBrexit.\u201d Case in point: News of the vote had largely been absent from the front pages of US papers until last week. And suddenly, it was as if the sky was falling because of something that sounded vaguely like breakfast cereal.\n\nSign Up For Our Daily Newsletter Sign Up Thank you for signing up!

America\u2019s political climate is so badly riven with conflict it took only a moment to draw the familiar partisan battle lines. Thus an ugly wave of exaggeration and ridicule swept across the Atlantic. CNN called it \u201cThe biggest step backwards since WWII\u201d; Vox said it was \u201cTrumpism, without Trump\u201d and all just \u201cfueled by irrational xenophobia.\u201d From the right, Breitbart cheered that it \u201cSignals the end of the New World Order\u201d and Trump himself held a press conference in Scotland claiming this was Britain \u201cTaking their country back\u201d (ignoring, it would seem, the awkward fact that Scotland voted Remain). Facebook and Twitter were flooded with posts from America either insulting Out voters as stupid or celebrating them as rebels. Here then was a vintage American export: the rhetoric America usually reserves only for domestic political enemies, packaged and shipped abroad.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear: Brexit is neither a romantic Independence Day from a rabidly socialist EU, nor a mass uprising of racist British nationalism. Pretending it\u2019s either one, in an effort to vent partisan anger ahead of November, is both counter-productive and petty. Brexit was a protest against several problems distilled into a single yes/no choice.\n\nFor one thing, Leave voters are not proxies for Trump supporters. Britain\u2019s politics contain more divisions than America\u2019s; it\u2019s far less orderly. Britain has six major political parties, arranged loosely from Right to Left as UKIP, Conservatives, Liberal Democrats and Labour, and the more single-issue Scottish National Party and Green Party. Sure, right-wing UKIP supporters voted overwhelmingly to leave, but they\u2019re a small party, with support from just over 10% of Brits; Left-wing Labour, Britain\u2019s biggest party alongside Conservatives, each supported by over 30% of Brits, contributed as many votes to Leave as UKIP, with over a third of Labour supporters voting \u2018out\u2019. Their leader, Jeremy Corbyn, is a well-known critic of the EU : he\u2019s said he\u2019s \u201cconcerned about the way the European Union is increasingly operating as a free market across Europe: tearing up the social chapter, damaging the working class and workers in Europe\u201d. Which is all to say that the vote wasn\u2019t neatly split along either philosophical or political lines.\n\nTo Corbyn, the EU prevents Britain from being socialist enough. He supported the Remain camp in the end, but he may as well have campaigned for Leave: his support was so tepid that fellow Labour party leaders are resigning their posts in protest and 172 voted against him in a no confidence vote Wednesday. Among conservatives, the leadership was split, with Boris Johnson officially leading the Leave campaign and Prime Minister David Cameron putting his job on the line for Remain. The conservative vote was split 42% Remain to 58% Leave. Even the Left-leaning Scottish National Party defies an easy label as it tilts anti-tax since coming into power; although conservatives are her political enemies, SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon stood alongside Cameron. This all makes for a very strange set of alliances, especially if you\u2019re accustomed to America\u2019s cleaner divisions. Imagine, though, Bernie Sanders campaigning with Chris Christie against 30% of Hillary supporters, who happen to side with Ted Cruz. In America, this would never happen, but that\u2019s a rough approximation of where loyalties stood in Britain.\n\nIt\u2019s further complicated because one of the core issues is immigration, which is about the most vexing one of all, with as wide a range of policy disagreements as you can find. Americans are familiar with how complex and contentious immigration debates can be\u2014so you\u2019d think they\u2019d cut the Brits some slack and be careful with charges of racism. Yes, some Leave voters were no doubt motivated by racism (although most EU migrants are not ethnic minorities) and there have been sad stories of xenophobic graffiti, even attacks following the vote. But another take on EU migration flips the racism argument on its head: some polls showed a third of ethnic minority voters supported Leave, among them South Asians most strongly.\n\nHere\u2019s why: Because EU rules set no limits on EU migration, and Britain has been forced to restrict non-European immigration, Brits of Indian or Bangladeshi origin who voted Leave often did so because they felt EU rules ultimately discriminate against people from non-European backgrounds, even those from Commonwealth countries. Some felt an EU thumb on the scales in favor of white Europeans with few or no ties to Britain.\n\nBut that\u2019s not a large swath of voters. Many Brits were simply eager for more of a say in who can live and work in their country. Under EU rules, anyone from another EU country can live, work and receive benefits in another EU country\u2014no work visas, no interviews\u2014and it\u2019s difficult to deport EU criminals. That\u2019s the bargain, and it\u2019s one that many feel is a raw deal.\n\nCameron\u2019s own plea to the EU before the referendum was to allow Britain to require EU workers to live in Britain for four years before claiming certain benefits. He didn\u2019t get these concessions, obviously, and now Britain will have to figure out its immigration policy from scratch. For Americans who are confused: Picture a situation in which America voted to force Congress to throw out all existing immigration laws and start from square one. Much as many might like such an outcome, it\u2019s going to cause some complex issues.\n\nThen there\u2019s the notion that pulling out of the EU is a brave feat of free market capitalism. Even if it\u2019s painful now, it\u2019s worth it in the long run, the argument goes. It\u2019s undeniably painful in the short run: yes, UK markets did bounce back somewhat from the initial shock, but the pound is still at its lowest levels since the 80\u2019s and $130Bn was wiped out of the FTSE (with many companies holding pensions and savings) in two days \u2013 that\u2019s almost five times as much as UKIP\u2019s leader Nigel Farage famously claimed Britain gives away to Europe every year. Yes, Europe can have onerous, sometimes silly regulation, but Britain\u2019s economy has done very well within the EU, and is now growing as fast as the US with unemployment diving to just above 5%. Some of Europe\u2019s pro-market regulation goes so far as to stop Britain from putting up tariffs, preventing it from propping up an uncompetitive industry like steel. One popular regulation British consumers could look forward to until now was the elimination of roaming charges across the EU. Ultimately, the EU is a massive common market of 500 million people (almost 200 million more than in the US), however Socialist individual countries might be, and Britain just cut off its unfettered access. That\u2019s not a vote for the free market: that\u2019s a vote against globalization with your nearest neighbors. American translation: Imagine if California pulled out of the United States, and now had to renegotiate all customs, tariffs and trade restrictions.\n\nBut the biggest issue with turning Brexit into a vicarious battle between America\u2019s Left and Right is this: it adds undue vitriol and anger at a time when Britain and Europe need unity and support. Britain faces an unprecedented leadership crisis ahead of its negotiations with Europe: Cameron has resigned, but it\u2019s unclear which conservative will replace him. Labour is in chaos. And there will be more than Brexit to negotiate: Northern Ireland is part of Britain, and borders the country of Ireland, which is part of the EU\u2014a split from the EU will require border controls on the Irish border that has been largely informal since the end of Northern Ireland\u2019s bloody conflict in the 1990s. Scotland might push for its own referendum to break away from Britain and re-join the EU, shattering a 300-year old union.\n\nAnd that\u2019s not all. European elites are poised to seek punishing terms for Britain, to set an example. They\u2019ve already rejected the idea of any \u201cinformal\u201d negotiations. In a masterful stroke of preterition, French President Francois Hollande had already threatened British voters ahead of the vote: \u201cI don\u2019t want to scare you but I just want to say the truth. There will be consequences in many areas.\u201d He was talking about France giving up its agreement on border protection in Calais, where refugees seeking access to Britain have set up camp at the French entrance to the Channel Tunnel. Angela Merkel is urging caution, saying negotiations cannot be rushed, but there are few signals this will be a friendly \u201cconscious uncoupling.\u201d\n\nAnd in the middle of that chaos, we have Americans yelling at each other and pretending that this is a simple proxy battle in their domestic ideological war. This, of course, at a time when America\u2019s support would go a long way to nudging Britain and Europe towards better cooperation. There\u2019s already a determined movement trying to establish a rapprochement between Leave and Remain, to help get a better outcome for Britain and for the EU. So please, Americans, the British do not need your partisanship right now. Wish the parties well, hope for the best, and please, don\u2019t drag them into a pre-November brawl instead. This is one American export we can all do without.\n\nChristine Nikol is a former management consultant with a background in politics and journalism.
