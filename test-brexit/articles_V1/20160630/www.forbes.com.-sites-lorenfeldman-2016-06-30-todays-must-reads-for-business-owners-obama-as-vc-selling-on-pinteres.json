    "text": "News and insights from around the Web:\n\nE-commerce\n\nHoping to compete with Amazon prime, Walmart is offering a free-shipping bonanza: \"Walmart\u2019s e-commerce business has floundered. In an effort to improve its lot, the big box giant announced the merger of its Arkansas and Silicon Valley tech teams earlier this year. The stats are dismal: Over the past two years, Walmart\u2019s digital growth has been on a steady downward trajectory, from 20 percent growth rates in 2014 down to 10 percent, 8 percent, and 7 percent in the past three quarters. That\u2019s way out of step with the rest of the retail sector. Target \u2019s digital sales rose 23 percent in the first quarter of 2016.\"\n\nSocial Media\n\nPinterest has introduced some new shopping features: \"At bottom, the site sees itself more as a competitor to Google \u2014 a way to search, discover and ultimately buy.'Shopping with Pinterest is meant to be that bridge between getting inspiration and actually making it a part of your life,' Ben Silbermann, the chief executive, said at an event at the company\u2019s San Francisco headquarters on Tuesday. Among the features are buyable pins,' or buttons, in browsers that users can click to purchase items on the site, as well as a digital shopping bag that follows users from their desktops to their smartphones or tablets.\n\nFacebook is changing its news feed to focus on friends and family -- not companies: \"The changes will affect all types of content posted by publishers, including links, videos, live videos and photos. Facebook said it expected a drop in reach and referral traffic for publishers whose audience comes primarily to content posted by the publisher\u2019s official Facebook page. Facebook plans to start making the changes as soon as this week. It will have less of an impact, however, if most of a publisher\u2019s traffic comes from individual users sharing and commenting on their stories and videos. As has long been the case, publisher content that your friends interact with will appear higher in the feed compared to posts shared directly by a publisher.\"\n\nSilicon Valley\n\nSal Kahn is educating the children of Silicon Valley's elite at a real school with actual walls: \"His laboratory school is not-for-profit, like the virtual academy upstairs. But it is an exclusive, selective private school not at all like the Khan Academy slogan -- 'A Free World-Class Education For Anyone, Anywhere.' Actually, Khan's lab school slogan could be 'a world class education for $25,000 a year for lucky Silicon Valley elites.' Khan disputes that. He says the point is to boldly experiment with research-based instruction. And then share everything the lab school learns with educators everywhere. 'Teachers are super over-worked; even to have the space to think about re-engineering is hard,' he explains 'Then, to actually do it, what is the curriculum? Everybody talks about project-based learning, but what are those projects?'\"\n\nHere's how the show \"Silicon Valley\" took a shot at Theranos: \"In the episode, main character and Pied Piper CEO Richard Hendricks is facing questions about his company and its user base, which, as it turns out, is partially fake. 'This is fraud,' Jared Dunn, head of business development at Pied Piper, tells Hendricks. Hendricks had a perfect response: \"Is it? Our platform does exactly what it says it does. It's not like we're f------ lying, like Theranos. And if our platform works, which we know it will, we will make them billions of dollars. Everyone wins.' The timely joke is referring to the blood-testing company's recent woes. In May, the company voided two years of test results from its proprietary Edison blood-testing machines.\"\n\nVenture Capital\n\nIn seven months, President Obama is going to need a job: \"Silicon Valley fetishizes failure, but it loves big wins even more. Obama has both. He notched two presidential election wins in the face of steep odds, and passed health-care reform and other signature policy achievements despite fierce political resistance. Of course, he\u2019s no stranger to big losses. Obama admitted the party was 'shellacked' during the 2010 mid-term elections, and policy missteps have cost him dearly with Congress and overseas. But that should serve him well in an industry where 95% of start-ups fail to deliver their projected return on investment, and just a few big wins are the difference between wild success and total failure.\"\n\nNo one is talking about why the first investment of a city-backed venture capital fund in Philadelphia has failed: \"Besides the short-lived statement, the company has remained quiet. Josh Kopelman, whose First Round Capital was tapped to manage the city-backed fund, rolled out the boilerplate: 'While we hope that all of the companies in the StartUpPHL portfolio will succeed, we recognize that as an early stage investor, many will not,' Kopelman said via email. 'As a policy, we don\u2019t comment on company specific matters, and instead defer to the founder/CEO of the company to comment.'\"\n\nGoing Global\n\nTrump and the Chamber of Commerce are fighting: \"The U.S. Chamber has been critical of Trump's trade and economic policies throughout the election and has offered pointed critiques of Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, as well. On Tuesday morning, before Trump took the stage at a raw aluminum producer outside of Pittsburgh, the Chamber published a post on its website that characterized the benefits of trade agreements as outweighing the drawbacks.\"\n\nCould Britain be headed for a Brexit boom? \"A new paper by Raja Patnaik, a PhD candidate in finance at the London Business School, looked at how U.S. companies reacted to unpredictable weather around El Nino cycles. Mr. Patnaik found that in highly competitive industries businesses, on average, increase spending in the face of higher uncertainty. This is true particularly when businesses have a high degree of operational flexibility\u2014that is, the ability to lay off workers in the event that demand collapses\u2014and for more labor intensive businesses. Imagine that weather forecasters are in conflict about what the future holds. Some say a blizzard will hit your town, others say the storm will pass to your north. If you run a shop that sells snow shovels, you have the choice to order more from the town\u2019s shovel factory now or wait until you get more certainty about the weather. If you are the only shop in town selling shovels, you can afford to wait. If there are several other shovel shops, however, by holding off you risk having to stock up during a potential run on shovels. So you have an incentive to buy now. That\u2019s expansionary uncertainty at work.\"\n\nHuman Resources\n\nA new state law in Ohio has blocked Cleveland from requiring contractors to hire local workers: \"In an interview, Mr. Jackson expressed dismay at a new state labor law, signed on May 30 by the Republican governor, John Kasich, that nullifies a 12-year city ordinance directing contractors working on most city projects to hire Cleveland residents for 20 percent of their labor force. The Ohio Contractors Association and the Republican-controlled legislature asserted that such local quotas, which also were in effect in Akron, made it harder for contractors to hire the best people. The provision, according to figures from Cleveland, generated 4,200 jobs from 2011 to 2015, almost all of them minority workers. 'That local labor provision helped people get jobs in this city,' said Mr. Jackson, who is also warily watching an initiative supported by unions that could make Cleveland the only city in Ohio that requires employers to pay a $15-an-hour minimum wage.\"\n\nMany states want to eliminate non-compete agreements: \"The issue hits Massachusetts with particular force because of its technology heritage and failure to keep up with Silicon Valley. In the early 1980s, the Route 128 corridor outside Boston, birthplace of the minicomputer industry and long-gone tech giants like the Digital Equipment Corporation, was seen as the Silicon Valley of the East. Noncompete pacts were only one ingredient in the recipe that worked against Massachusetts and to the advantage of Silicon Valley, where employees can depart and start their own companies mostly without fear of a lawsuit. But they mattered. In California, companies are generally prohibited from enforcing noncompete agreements because of a worker-friendly statute from the 19th century.\"",
