    "text": "Before Britain\u2019s historic vote to leave the European Union last Thursday, the Obama administration was eager to pressure the British people to stay in.\n\nThey lost, but they can\u2019t stop playing their games.\n\nOn Tuesday, Secretary of State John Kerry, speaking at the Aspen Ideas Festival, was asked if Britain\u2019s decision could be \u201cwalked back,\u201d and if so, how. Kerry responded:\n\nI think there are a number of ways. I don\u2019t, as secretary of state, want to throw them out today. I think that would be a mistake. But there are a number of ways.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear about this. The only mistake Kerry made was that, he, as an American official, announced in public that he\u2019s eagerly plotting ways to overturn the result of a democratic referendum held by a close ally of the United States.\n\nPerhaps the secretary should take a lesson from his boss\u2019s adventures in Brexit.\n\nIn April, President Barack Obama went to Britain to give a lecture on why Britain shouldn\u2019t leave the European Union. After he spoke, the Leave campaign surged in the polls. If bossy foreigners could sell Britain on the EU, it wouldn\u2019t have voted out.\n\nIt might seem like Kerry\u2019s not doing anything here except being foolish. But there\u2019s a strategy here.\n\nThe EU doesn\u2019t take losing lying down. Right now, it\u2019s busy claiming that Britain doesn\u2019t have a plan for life after Brexit. And Kerry\u2019s chiming in.\n\nTheir idea: frighten Britain from leaving, even after it\u2019s voted to leave. That\u2019s just like the EU, which can\u2019t help but believe that no one can figure anything out without guidance from on high\u2014or rather, from Brussels.\n\nSure, democracy is messy. So is pulling your nation out of the grasp of the EU octopus.\n\nBut that\u2019s the way freedom works: It means you make decisions democratically, and locally, and you figure out what works. The EU doesn\u2019t like that. Nor does Kerry. It\u2019s too bad for them that Britain\u2019s already voted. It\u2019s time for them to accept reality.\n\nAfter all, as Kerry\u2019s boss likes to say, elections have consequences. Yes, they do. And one consequence of last week\u2019s vote is that Kerry\u2019s side lost.",
