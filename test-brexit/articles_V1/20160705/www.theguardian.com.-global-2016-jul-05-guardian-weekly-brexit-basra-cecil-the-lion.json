    "text": "It\u2019s been another week of political upheaval here in London as the dust refuses to settle on the UK\u2019s vote to leave the European Union. An oft-heard expression is that \u201cWe are where we are\u201d, which of course would be fine if anyone actually knew where that was.\n\nTo summarise briefly: sterling continues to tank on the currency exchanges, the main political parties are convulsed with leadership struggles that make Game of Thrones look like polite society, and there\u2019s even talk of a legal challenge to the government over activating article 50, the clause that would set in train the UK\u2019s departure from the EU. In this week\u2019s paper we bring you the best coverage and opinion from the Guardian and Observer.\n\nFor our cover story Ghaith Abdul-Ahad returns to Basra, the southern oil city occupied by British troops during the Iraq war. Coinciding with the findings this week of a long-awaited inquiry into Britain\u2019s decision to go to war, Abdul-Ahad hears a story of lost ambition and abandonment that resonates with the wider post-war legacy in Iraq. The bitterness of that legacy is only too apparent in the light of major terrorist attacks claimed by Islamic State in Baghdad, Istanbul and Dhaka.\n\nAustralia went to the polls this week where a hung parliament looked the likeliest outcome, as voter indifference to the main parties and delays in collecting postal votes combined to obscure the final result.\n\nIn India, a tomato-growing crisis is playing havoc with the nation\u2019s eating habits. Long queues for food persist in Venezuela as citizens press for a recall of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. In Japan, the country\u2019s looming demographic crisis is illustrated by statistics that show more than 25% of the population is now aged over 65.\n\nIn the long-read Weekly Review, we consider why wrongheaded ideas such as the flat earth theory refuse to go away, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary. There\u2019s also a look at China\u2019s efforts to clean up its foul-smelling waterways, and how US farmers\u2019 markets are no longer so profitable for produce growers.\n\nThe shooting of Cecil the Lion in Zimbabwe a year ago by an American hunter sparked outrage, but on the Discovery pages we find out how the episode has created a positive legacy for wildlife conservation schemes.\n\nThere\u2019s an outdoorsy feel to the back of the paper. The Books pages consider the joys of mountain climbing, while the Culture section examines Australia\u2019s national obsession with swimming pools. If that\u2019s not enough fresh air for you, Nature watch goes frolicking with pine martens in the Scottish Highlands.\n\nWhy do we pay through the nose (as opposed to any other part of the body), asks Notes & Queries. In Good to meet you, a reluctant emigr\u00e9e to Los Angeles explains why her Guardian Weekly subscription keeps her sane.\n\nThese are busy times, but the Weekly has them covered. Enjoy the edition and do keep your views coming in on the state of things \u2013 we love to read them.\n\nWould you like to change your delivery address? Your email address? Suspend delivery?
