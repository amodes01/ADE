    "text": "Film director Abbas Kiarostami during his visit to the 54th Cartagena Film Festival in Colombia in 2014.\n\nAn influential Iranian filmmaker has died. How the art world gets \u201cBrexit\u201d all wrong. And helpful advice for George Lucas on how he might actually get his museum of narrative art built. Plus, President Obama\u2019s library architects, the Orange County Museum of Art moves forward with move plans and a series of urban hikes that take you past a San Fernando Valley neighborhood\u2019s splashy new murals. Here\u2019s the Roundup:\n\n\u2014 Abbas Kiarostami, the Palme d\u2019Or-winning Iranian director known for meditative pictures focused on the quests of everyday people and a figure whose entr\u00e9e into the arts began as a student of painting at the University of Tehran, has died at the age of 76.\n\nFor the record: A previous version of this post reported that the Beretta family helped fund artist Christo\u2019s installation in Italy. The installation was funded by the artist.\n\nAn EU balloon is attached to the Winston Churchill statue in Parliament Square in London as protesters took part in a March for Europe on Saturday. (Niklas Hallen / AFP Photo )\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2014 Ben Davis has a pretty terrific essay on the art world\u2019s lack of self-awareness in the wake of Brexit. \u201c\u2019The future,\u2019\u201d he writes, \u201ccan appear as an optimistic beacon only if you stand on its jet-setting winning side.\u201d (And in case you need a primer: John Oliver explains Brexit, complete with dirty song performed by an angelic-looking boy.)\n\n\u2014 Obama has picked Billie Tsien Tod William Architects to design his presidential library. Critics Christopher Hawthorne of The Times and Kriston Capps of Citylab say the selection is right in keeping with Obama\u2019s style.\n\n\u2014 Speaking of architectural projects in Chicago, critic Blair Kamin writes that it was George Lucas\u2019 own hubris that cost him his museum project in Chicago. The film director is now looking at a San Francisco site, where Chronicle critic John King offers him some friendly advice for getting the deal sealed: \u201cThe museum proposals had an air of preordained inevitability, as though we should be grateful for such blessings from above. Guess what. People don\u2019t like to be told what\u2019s good for them, especially in a city where change barrels toward us from all directions.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2014 Is movement finally afoot for the Orange County Museum of Art to relocate to a Thom Mayne-designed building in Costa Mesa? The museum\u2019s brass tells the O.C. Register that momentum is picking up. But the museum has yet to sell its property or launch a capital campaign.\n\n\u2014 A Facebook exchange that is totally worth reading: New York cultural affairs commissioner Tom Finkelpearl and Creative Time curator Nato Thompson have a wide-ranging discussion about art and politics and ambiguity. More of this please! (@TylerGreenDC)\n\nSee the most-read stories in Entertainment this hour >>\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn aerial view of the installation \u201cThe Floating Piers\u201d by Christo on Lake Iseo, northern Italy last month. (Filippo Venezia / Ansa via AP )\n\n\u2014 Christo has said that his \u201cFloating Piers\u201d installation at Lake Iseo in Italy was purely an aesthetic intervention. But the project, writes Mike Watson, received logistical support from the Beretta arms manufacturing family \u2014 raising questions about whether an installation of this nature can truly be free of politics. Want to see it for yourself? An Italian website has gathered a collection of 360-degree videos of the install.\n\n\u2014 Architectural critic Mark Lamster tells the story of a concrete-heavy Dallas tower designed by Paul Rudolph. Once a corporate HQ, it is now affordable housing for the elderly \u2014 an interesting look at how difficult architecture can be adapted for new uses rather than being destroyed.\n\n\u2014 Critic Hilton Als on the \u201clawless bohemianism\u201d of Nan Goldin\u2019s \u201cThe Ballad of Sexual Dependency\u201d \u2014 the photography project that famously captured love, life and heartbreak amid the artsy downtown Manhattan scene of the \u201880s.\n\n\u2014 A profile of abstract artist Carmen Herrera, who at the age of 101 is finally getting her due.\n\n\u2014 Shawn Taylor asks a very good question: Why haven\u2019t any of Octavia Butler\u2019s books been turned into a movie? I vote for a film version of \u201cKindred\u201d directed by Ava DuVernay.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2014 W.E.B. DuBois\u2019 Modernist data visualizations of black life. A wondrous intersection of history, data and design.\n\n\u2014 It\u2019s all about the ego: Comparing \u201880s era Donald Trump to \u201880s era Julian Schnabel.\n\n\u2014 Supply kits for the apocalypse, artist edition.\n\n\u2014 From the Department of Very Meta Exhibitions: The Hollywood Bowl Museum has an exhibition of posters asking pilots not to fly over the Hollywood Bowl.\n\n\u2014 Los Angeles magazine has posted a series of walks that can be done around the city \u2014 including a four-mile trek that features the murals of Pacoima. I can get behind any walking tour that includes a mural of Danny Trejo.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2014 In Boyle Heights, a historic Victorian house is moved \u2026 to a new location across the street.\n\n\u2014 Illustrator Kevin Kidney has uploaded scans of a 1960 Disneyland gift catalogue to his blog \u2014 featuring everything from Matterhorn playing cards to cowgirl suits.\n\n\u2014 Why business majors need a liberal arts education.\n\n\u2014 And last but not least: How to tell if you are in a Dostoevsky novel.\n\nFind me on Twitter @cmonstah.\n\nMORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRenowned Iranian film director Abbas Kiarostami dies at 76\n\nNoel Neill dies at 95; first actress to play Lois Lane\n\nJesse Williams and the academy just changed Hollywood\u2019s race conversation.
