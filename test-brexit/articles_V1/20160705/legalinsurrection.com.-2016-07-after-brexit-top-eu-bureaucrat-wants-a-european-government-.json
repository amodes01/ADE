    "text": "\u201cYou never want a serious crisis to go to waste,\u201d Chicago Mayor and long-time Obama confidant Rahm Emanuel once said. Despite being rejected by the UK voters in the last month\u2019s referendum, top bureaucrats running the European Union want to do precisely that. Since Brexit results, they have unveiled plans to build an EU Army, expand the entitlement programmes, and boldest of all \u2014 calls to create a unified EU Government, a pan-European Superstate.\n\nWhat was once confined to the realm of myth and conspiracy theory, is now being proposed from the helm of the EU. On the day of the Brexit result, President of EU Parliament Martin Schluz and German Vice-Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel published a detailed proposal calling for reconstituting the EU into a European Government. Both Gabriel and Schulz are leading members of Germany\u2019s Social Democratic Party (SPD) that is currently in a coalition with Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s Christian Democrats (CDU). Having tied its lot to Merkel\u2019s policy of open borders, SPD\u2019s poll numbers have hit a historic low. The proposal co-published by two of the Europe\u2019s most powerful politicians wants to wrest remaining economic powers away from the national governments, creating an \u2018Economic Schengen\u2019 zone.\n\nNational governments, especially in Eastern Europe, are regarded by Eurocrats as the biggest obstacle in enforcing their open migration and resettlement plan within Europe. The resistance by some member states against Brussels\u2019 migration policy of resettling migrants (mainly young men from Arab and Muslim countries) has been dubbed by Schulz as the \u201cpurest form of national egoism\u201d. On Monday, the German newspaper Die Tageszeitung reported the Schulz-Gabriel proposal:\n\nAfter the Brexit referendum Martin Schulz has been campaigning for a stronger EU. While top leaders of the Christian Democratic Party (CDU) have emphasised on the importance of the nation state, Schulz wants more Europe \u2014 and thereby turning into a key figure for the supporters of a stronger EU. [\u2026] It wouldn\u2019t be enough to turn a few screws around this time, Schulz wrote in a debate piece for the [newspaper] Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. \u201cNo, we want to raise the stakes that would make it clear that we have got the message (\u2026).\u201d The European Union needs to be reconstituted into a true European Government. [The European Government] must be controlled by the EU Parliament and be subordinate to a second chamber \u2014 made up of representatives of the member states. This suggestion was also listed in the 10 Point Programme Schulz had published together with Sigmar Gabriel, the head of the Germany\u2019s Social Democratic Party, shortly after the British vote. It is a power shift: Away from Markel and EU head of states, towards the EU Parliament and Commission. [Author\u2019s Translation]\n\nLast August when the Migrant Crisis began, Schulz\u2019s proposal for an EU-wide \u2018Refugee and Immigration Policy\u2019 was met with stiff resistance from several EU members. Schulz backed German Chancellor Merkel as she arbitrarily suspended the Dublin Protocol, a legal mechanism put in place to register and regulate immigration into the Schengen-Zone stretching across Europe.\n\nWhat began as the result of Merkel\u2019s unilateral move, could only be described as a full blown invasion of Europe. Over a million migrants, mostly Arab and Muslim men in their fighting age, entered Germany alone \u2014 within a span of a following months.\n\nParis and Brussels were hit by worst terrorist attacks, killing and maiming hundreds. Police investigations later revealed that many of the perpetrators of those attacks posed as refugees to enter Europe. Not just the city of Cologne on the New Year\u2019s Eve, several other German cities witnessed mass sexual assaults on local women by gangs of migrant men.\n\nAll these incidents have turn the mood of electorates throughout Europe against a EU-backed generous migration policy, forcing national governments to set up border fences and re-introduce immigration controls.\n\nIf EU bosses were displeased by these minor acts of \u2018insubordination\u2019 by individual member states, the Brexit-rebellion has rattled the EU top brass. Schulz\u2019s proposal now wants to strip the nation states of their powers to such a degree that would never be able to stand up to the dictates from Brussels ever again.\n\nThe question is, will the EU bosses use Brexit to consolidate their hold on European nation states or will the freedom-loving people of Europe rise up to them and won\u2019t let this \u201ccrisis go waste\u201d.\n\nVIDEO: After Brexit, bitter exchanges inside EU Parliament\n\n[Cover image courtesy Universit\u00e4t Magdeburg, YouTube] [Writer is an analyst reporting from Germany]\n\nDonations tax deductible\n\nto the full extent allowed by law.",
