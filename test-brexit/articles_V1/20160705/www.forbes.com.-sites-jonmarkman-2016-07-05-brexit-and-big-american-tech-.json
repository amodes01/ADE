    "text": "Technology firms have really been dreading Brexit. Now that it\u2019s here, the heavy lifting begins and many sore backs are likely.\n\nAlthough the idea of stitching together disparate European countries was always a long shot \u2013 after two thousand years of nonstop fighting \u2013 the hope among tech business leaders was centered on strength in numbers and single market access.\n\nGreat Britain has never been a good fit for this model. Britons have always had a healthy skepticism about Europe. Even as it joined the European Union in the 1990s, it refused to give up control of its borders and currency. Given the immigration and debt crisis that followed, that was prescient. Despite flaws in execution of the EU, international business bought in. Companies set up shops in business-friendly London and plotted growth strategies across the continent. Two weeks ago, that bridge to Europe\u2019s single market fell down.\n\nFor large technology companies this is especially troublesome. Amazon expanded aggressively into England, spending $6.3 billion to build out its logistics operations. From its London hub the plan was to easily ship products across all of Europe. Along with Facebook and Alphabet , Microsoft and eBay, it was working hard to do the same with digital goods and services. Big American tech companies were pushed into unlikely alliances as they fought inward-looking EU bureaucrats. Despite the name, their Digital Single Market erected new regulations for e-commerce, digital streaming and user privacy for non-European digital platforms. In this fight, pro-U.S. business forces in the UK were allies. With Brexit, that ally is dead.\n\nBrexit is going to make it much harder for big American tech companies to do business in Europe. EU mainstays Germany and France have always been more protective of European companies. In the wake of Brexit they\u2019re likely to flex their muscle, quickly making an example of the Brits and their allies. Companies like Google, which is currently under the watchful eye of European Commission regulators, may be in for a rude awakening.\n\nSome political scientists have made the case the only real loser is Great Britain. Already there is talk about big banks moving their headquarters from London to Frankfurt and some technology firms are understandably curtailing investment as the dust settles. Even the fear of losing these high paying jobs and investment should be enough to kill the red hot London housing market where speculators have pushed prices 10.1% higher since 2015.\n\nIt\u2019s unlikely the EU will be sympathetic. Brexit sets up possible exit votes in France and the Netherlands where far right political groups are pushing for closed borders and more strident Nationalism. It\u2019s a scary time for businesses, which prefer the status quo.\n\nThe idea of the EU was stitched together through necessity. The countries needed a single market to survive in the global marketplace. Governments wanted a good reason to stop bludgeoning each other after two world wars. Companies bought in. Even the UK bought in, for a while.\n\nAnd now? Hedge fund pioneer George Soros suggests the failure of the union will bring a worse outcome than if it had never happened. That's probably overstating the case, but who knows -- he's awfully smart and experienced.\n\nAlthough we are at the start of an amazing era of innovation, American technology companies that made large investments in Europe are likely to suffer setbacks. Yet the big trend is definitely up. Adaptive, ambitious companies will pick up the pieces and be stronger for it. As always, the strong will survive and the weak will be exposed.",
