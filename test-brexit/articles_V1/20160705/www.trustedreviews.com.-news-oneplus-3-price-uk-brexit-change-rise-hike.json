    "text": "OnePlus recently confirmed plans to increase the price of its flagship OnePlus 3 smartphone \u2013 and the \u00a320 price hike has just gone into effect.\n\nThe OnePlus 3 just rose from its previous price of \u00a3309 to \u00a3329 as of this morning. The decision is in response to the fluctuating value of Sterling following the UK\u2019s decision to leave the European Union.\n\nIn a statement posted online, a OnePlus spokesperson said: \u201c We\u2019ve seen a downward trend for the Pound against the USD over the past few months. While we\u2019ve held off action for as long as we can, the sharp drop witnessed in the currency markets following the Brexit decision has forced us to re-evaluate the OnePlus 3\u2019s pricing in the UK at a time of significant demand.\u201d\n\nThe spokesperson continued:\n\n\u201cGiven the effects of the unstable market son our extremely thin margins, we\u2019re reluctantly going to have to make some small changes to our pricing structure for the [OnePlus 3]. There\u2019s still time to pick up the device at the current price of \u00a3309. We said that we\u2019d give you as much notice as possible, and we\u2019re committed to taking the hit over the next few days and absorbing the resulting losses.\u201d\n\nOnePlus also confirmed that the price increase only applies to the price of the OnePlus 3, and that accessories won\u2019t be affected.\n\nThe OnePlus 3 is a smartphone made by Chinese manufacturer OnePlus, and was revealed on June 14, 2016. It\u2019s the fourth phone built by the two-year-old firm and, despite being a high-end handset, is significantly cheaper than many of its rivals at just \u00a3309. That\u2019s made possible by OnePlus selling its devices at close to manufacturing cost. These thin margins means that OnePlus is acutely affected by currency fluctuations.\n\nOnePlus co-founder Carl Pei apologised to customers on Twitter shortly after the company confirmed the price hike:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/statuses/750289837790408704\n\nPei also confirmed to one user that if the Pound rose significantly, OnePlus would consider reducing the price of the OnePlus 3 even beyond the launch price:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/statuses/750290968226570240\n\nDespite the bad news, customers seemed to support the decision to increase the price of the OnePlus 3 \u2013 on Twitter, anyway:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/statuses/750290239722323968\n\nhttps://twitter.com/statuses/750290328071135232\n\nhttps://twitter.com/statuses/750291944077660160\n\nOn the OnePlus forums, user \u2018SeanPlus\u2019 posted: \u201cAnyway, tis\u2019 a shame the price is going up, but understandable. Glad you have given UK customers/fans some notice.\u201d\n\nAnother user called \u2018Sinjan22\u2019 posted: \u201cWe need to appreciate that OnePlus are still a company \u2013 they experience profits and losses like any company does. I\u2019m glad that they\u2019re giving their fans the opportunity to still buy the phone at the ordinary price though.\u201d\n\nThe currency fluctuations are in response to the UK\u2019s decision to leave the European Union after a majority voted for exit in last week\u2019s referendum. Since then, the value of Sterling has sunk, with Sterling now at its lowest value against the American dollar in 31 years. Shaun Osborne, Chief Currency Strategist at Scotiabank, recently told Market Watch that the British pound could hit parity (equal value) with the US dollar by the end of the year.\n\nRelated: OnePlus 3 vs Nexus 6P\n\nWatch our OnePlus 3 review:\n\nWhat do you think of this story?
