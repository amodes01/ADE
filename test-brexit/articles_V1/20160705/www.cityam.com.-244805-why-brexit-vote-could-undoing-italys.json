The European Commission has recently agreed to a guarantee scheme for a precautionary liquidity support scheme for banks in need.\n\nIt has also been reported that the Italian government may be seeking out arrangements to inject \u20ac40bn worth of capital into the banking system.\n\nRead more: Big firms suffer as investment banking fees plunge 23 per cent\n\nMeanwhile, Monte Paschi confirmed in a statement on Monday that it had received a letter from the European Central Bank (ECB) asking the institution to meet certain requirements. The statement also noted that the bank has the opportunity to explain any mitigating circumstances by 8 July and has until 3 October to present a plan of management actions designed to reduce the ratio between total non-performing loans and total loans to 20 per cent by 2018.\n\nHowever, the situation is not entirely without hope. Although many banks have struggled to offload their bad loans, Banco Popolare revealed last Thursday \u2013 one week after the UK's EU membership vote took place \u2013 that it had agreed a sale on \u20ac53.8m worth of such debt.",
