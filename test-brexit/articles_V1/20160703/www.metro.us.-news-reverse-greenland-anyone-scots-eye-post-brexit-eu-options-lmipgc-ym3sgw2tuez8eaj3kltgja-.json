    "text": "By Alastair Macdonald and Elisabeth O\u2019Leary\n\nBRUSSELS/EDINBURGH (Reuters) \u2013 Could Scots get their wish to remain, effectively, in the European Union even while maintaining their union with England once the United Kingdom as whole leaves the EU?\n\nDubbed the \u201creverse Greenland\u201d option, that was among ideas kicked around by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon during a flying visit to Brussels after Scots voted heavily against Brexit while their southern neighbors opted to quit the EU.\n\nSturgeon, a pro-independence nationalist, stressed during her visit to the EU capital on Wednesday that she was keeping an open mind and simply wanted \u201call of the options for Scotland\u201d considered once a new British government starts negotiations on what, in principle, is supposed be a two-year divorce process.\n\nBut several people involved in the meetings she had with the EU executive and lawmakers told Reuters that ideas discussed included possible models based on the fact that several states have some parts in the EU and some outside \u2013 as in the case of EU member Denmark and its non-EU territory Greenland.\n\nAt its most extreme \u2013 and, in the view of officials and experts, deeply implausible \u2013 a \u201creverse Greenland\u201d solution might see the Scottish government in Edinburgh take on Britain\u2019s EU membership while remaining in the United Kingdom and the UK government in London would, like Greenland in the 1980s, pull England out of the EU while keeping the British state united.\n\nMore plausibly, Sturgeon\u2019s warm reception in Brussels amid the shock of Brexit, highlighted the possibility that British withdrawal from the EU could well be accompanied by special EU arrangements for some of the United Kingdom\u2019s constituent parts \u2013 not just Scotland but also Northern Ireland and Gibraltar.\n\n\u201cThey discussed possibly Scotland getting special status within the UK to let it still be a member of the EU somehow,\u201d an EU official who took part in one of Sturgeon\u2019s meetings said.\n\n\u201cOn the \u2018reverse Greenland\u2019 option, she wasn\u2019t trying to put it on the agenda. It was a genuine reflection.\u201d\n\nSenior EU officials say they are in no mood now to do more than brainstorm, even if they sympathize with the plight of the pro-EU Scots. Brussels faces existential and legal nightmares to cut loose the bloc\u2019s second biggest economy and expects to wait months for a new British government even to start the process.\n\n\u201cScotland is a part of the UK,\u201d a spokesman for the European Commission said. \u201cAll parts of the UK should sort out what they want to do,\u201d he added, calling the options \u201cspeculation\u201d.\n\nWITHOUT INDEPENDENCE, OPTIONS OPEN\n\nHowever, Sturgeon\u2019s trip to Brussels, on the very day the EU sat down without Britain to consider its options, showed leaders her determination to get a seat at the Brexit negotiating table.\n\nCrucially for her charm offensive in a city that rebuffed Scots\u2019 appeals for assurances of EU membership during their 2014 independence referendum \u2013 a reflection of fears of secession in other EU states such as Spain \u2013 Sturgeon kept the secession card firmly off the table, insisting that was not the priority.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t come at it from the starting point of independence,\u201d she told reporters in Brussels. \u201cWe come at it from the starting point of protecting Scotland\u2019s interests.\u201d\n\nAnother person familiar with one of her meetings said Sturgeon was told that Brussels did not want to be drawn into a battle inside Britain or offer a future independent Scotland any fast-track to EU membership \u2013 and she had not disputed that.\n\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t use the Brexit referendum as an excuse to leave the UK. She wasn\u2019t pushing independence at all,\u201d the person said. \u201cThat was smart \u2026 it\u2019s not what Brussels wants to hear.\u201d\n\nAlyn Smith, an EU lawmaker for Sturgeon\u2019s Scottish National Party (SNP) who won a standing ovation in the chamber on Tuesday with a plea to the EU not to \u201clet Scotland down\u201d, stressed: \u201cI am talking about status rather than membership \u2026 Everyone wants to talk about Scottish independence \u2013 except us.\u201d\n\nKeeping close EU ties, such as in education and research for which Edinburgh has its own powers and a big economic interest, might be achieved in a variety of ways, involving considerably less constitutional acrobatics than Greenland-inspired ideas. These would be much more likely to secure approval by the other 27 EU states.\n\n\u201cReverse Greenland\u201d is just \u201csilly\u201d in the opinion of David Edward, formerly Britain\u2019s justice on the EU\u2019s top court and, with Smith, a member of an advisory panel Sturgeon set up in the wake of the Brexit vote to explore Scotland\u2019s options.\n\nScotland has 100 times the population of Greenland and, in the reverse scenario, it would be England, 10 times bigger again, that was playing \u201cGreenland\u201d to Scotland\u2019s \u201cDenmark\u201d. In other states with differing internal relations with the EU, it is minority regions, not the main state, which is outside.\n\nBut, Edward said, the Scottish government could use devolved powers in some areas to rework partnerships with Brussels.\n\nAUTONOMOUS PARALLELS\n\nAlyn Smith said the advisory group had drawn up a list of all the different territorial arrangements in the EU, which also include for example exemptions from EU tax and economic rules for the likes of French departments in the Caribbean or the English Channel island of Jersey, ruled by the British crown.\n\nThe closest, though not very close, analogy, Smith thinks, is that of Finland\u2019s autonomous, Swedish-speaking Aland Islands.\n\nScotland should look into using devolved powers to take part in EU programs like the Erasmus student system or the Horizon 2020 research fund, in which several non-EU states \u2013 including Israel \u2013 participate, Edward said: \u201cIt\u2019s not much but it\u2019s something, given Scotland\u2019s commitment to academic research.\u201d\n\nSturgeon has not ruled out the possibility of a second independence referendum and Scottish anger at Brexit and chaos in London politics may have bolstered support for secession. But the fall in oil prices has put Scotland\u2019s potential finances in a poorer position than two years ago, while the depth of trade ties with England and the problems that a new customs border along the River Tweed would create still leave many unconvinced.\n\nThe EU also would be unlikely to grant Scotland concessions that Britain has secured during its 43 years of membership.\n\nEU officials also caution that Sturgeon should not under-estimate hostility among other member states. The Spanish prime minister, wary of Catalan separatists, was also in Brussels on Wednesday and threw cold water on Scottish EU membership.\n\nYet, the demonstrative pro-European clamor in Scotland has struck a chord with shellshocked EU politicians who, Edward said, are \u201cabsolutely fed up to the back teeth\u201d of the British.\n\n\u201cAt least Nicola Sturgeon maintained goodwill,\u201d he said.\n\nMEP Smith said that goodwill could be vital in promoting the kind of legal creativity EU lawyers are renowned for: \u201cBrussels is good at this,\u201d he told Reuters. \u201cSo if there is goodwill \u2013 and there is goodwill as we saw \u2013 a solution is possible.\u201d\n\n(editing by Janet McBride)",
