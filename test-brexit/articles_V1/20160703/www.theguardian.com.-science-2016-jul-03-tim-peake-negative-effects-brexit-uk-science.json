    "text": "Britain must ensure that its world class scientific research is not harmed as a result of the UK\u2019s decision to leave the EU, the astronaut Tim Peake has said.\n\nThe former helicopter test pilot, who returned from a six-month mission to the International Space Station in June, called the referendum result \u201ca surprising decision for everybody\u201d but said it was important to reunite and get on with securing the best future for Britain.\n\nPeake said: \u201cI missed a lot of the campaigning, but I\u2019m aware now that it caused divisiveness and some of it was not done in the most positive fashion. We have to put that behind us now and work on unity and moving forwards.\u201d\n\nPeake said the protection of UK scientific research was a priority in the negotiations that lie ahead.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have to make sure we don\u2019t harm ourselves in areas where the EU was particularly good for us. I don\u2019t want to see scientists being punished, and this having negative effects on our science. These are important areas for us to focus on now.\u201d\n\nScientific research is a major contributor to the UK economy, but it stands to be the greatest loser from Brexit. UK universities receive 10% of their research funds from the EU, and across the country, science is propped up by grants from Brussels. There are signs that UK organisations are already being passed over for EU science collaborations because their future involvement cannot be guaranteed.\n\nPeake is involved in several experiments into the effects of weightlessness on the human body. He had barely been back on Earth a week when Britain voted to leave the EU in a marginal referendum that threw the future unity of the UK into doubt and sent the major political parties into crises from which they have yet to recover.\n\n\u201cI have seen some comments on Twitter saying everything was fine until Tim Peake came back to Earth,\u201d he told the Guardian in his first newspaper interview since landing. \u201cThat did make me feel rather bad.\u201d\n\nPeake blasted off to space in December 2015 on what started out as a textbook launch to the International Space Station. But as the Soyuz capsule carrying Peake, the Nasa astronaut Tim Kopra, and the Russian commander, Yuri Malenchenko, prepared to dock with the orbiting station, there was a glitch.\n\nThroughout the whole rendezvous manoeuvre, an alarm warned of high humidity levels in the Soyuz capsule. Though fairly trivial on its own, it masked a second, more serious warning triggered by a sensor that registered a thruster failure. The capsule automatically aborted its approach and retreated to a safe position 90 metres away.\n\nPeake said: \u201cIt happened only 17 metres from the station, which is pretty close. At that stage you\u2019d have thought everything was going fine, all the systems have been checked, and we\u2019re coming in on the final approach, so it really took us by surprise.\u201d It is thought to be the nearest the Soyuz has ever aborted an automatic docking manoeuvre with the International Space Station.\n\nMalenchenko took over manual control, but the space station was in Earth\u2019s shadow at the time and the docking port was hardly visible in the darkness. He steered the capsule in by hand, but was off target, and had to pull back again for a second attempt. On the next approach, he berthed the Soyuz without incident.\n\nPeake returned to Earth on 18 June, having circled the planet nearly 3,000 times during his 186 days in space. He arrived back at the European Space Agency\u2019s base in Cologne at 3am on the Sunday morning and spent the night there with his wife, Rebecca, and their two young sons.\n\n\u201cThe first time I saw them there was this patter of feet outside the door and they both just burst in. They had obviously woken up together and decided to rush in. It was really lovely, a very special moment,\u201d he said. Since then, the couple have taken the boys to the local park near the Rhine and explained over ice-cream that Major Peake had not been aboard Han Solo\u2019s Millennium Falcon.\n\nThe first few months back on Earth are intense with rehabilitation and science experiments. In daily exercise sessions, Peake works out to rebuild the muscles he has lost in space. It takes a few days to regain a sense of balance, and until it returns, Peake said it feels like the worst hangover ever: move your head and you immediately feel sick and dizzy.\n\nOnce the sickness abates, the body needs more time to fine tune its senses. Peake said: \u201cI\u2019d be walking down the street and turn my head to talk to someone next to me and just wander off the pavement into the road.\u201d He feels 100% now, but still has to take care not to pull any muscles. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing how heavy the head is. Your neck muscles do work hard to support it again,\u201d he said.\n\nExperiments take up the lion\u2019s share of Peake\u2019s daily routine. On Friday, he spent more than an hour in an MRI scanner. He has given blood samples and muscle biopsies, had tests on his eyes, cardiovascular system, and skin, to investigate how they age in space. He spent two nights hooked up to equipment that monitored his circadian rhythms to see how they differ before and after six months in space. He will soon head to Nasa\u2019s astronaut centre in Houston for more tests there.\n\nBefore he left the space station, he took time to cement his memories, a strategy other astronauts have used to say goodbye to the station. He misses the view of Earth from space, but also the constant daily challenges of the job and the team assembled around him.\n\nLater this year, Peake will visit schools and tour the country to share his experiences of life in orbit. In the days before he landed, the bookies opened bets on Peake appearing on TV, with Strictly Come Dancing and Top Gear among the favourites.\n\nPeake said: \u201cOn Strictly, I\u2019d say there\u2019s zero to no chance. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m ready to put myself through the embarrassment of sharing my dancing skills with the public. As for Top Gear, anything with an engine that goes fast I absolutely love, so I certainly wouldn\u2019t turn down the opportunity.\u201d",
