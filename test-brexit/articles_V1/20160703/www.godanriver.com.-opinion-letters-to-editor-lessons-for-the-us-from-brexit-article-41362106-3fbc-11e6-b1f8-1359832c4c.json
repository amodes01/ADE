    "text": "To the editor:\n\nThere are a number of lessons to be learned from the recent Brexit vote, which we in the United States would be wise to heed. This issue may well be revisited in the United Kingdom, partly for reasons which will be addressed here.\n\nFirst, this initial vote to leave the EU was largely driven, statistically, by white, high-school educated males who are feeling disenfranchised in their own country. Sound familiar? Read: Donald Trump supporters.\n\nYounger voters of both genders and more highly educated voters \u2014 as well as the majority of Scots \u2014 voted for remaining in the EU. But the problem was this: huge numbers of younger voters \u2014 polled as being highly supportive of remaining in the union \u2014 didn\u2019t show up to vote. They thought that it was impossible\n\nthat the people of the UK would vote for leaving the EU.\n\nThe lesson is that people who are rightly afraid of having Donald Trump as the head of this nation must get out and vote in November.\n\nAccording to recent polls, he now has a 70 percent unfavorable rating, but this will mean nothing if people don\u2019t vote against him. I have heard so many people say they just aren\u2019t going to vote this year, because they cannot stand Trump, but they don\u2019t like Secretary Hillary Clinton either. The result of that kind of thinking could very well be exactly what just happened in the UK.\n\nSecond, when is the populace of the United States going to grow up and understand that we live in a global economy, a global politic, a global society?\n\nThese are not the days of Woodrow Wilson \u2014 or even of Dwight Eisenhower \u2014 although either of them would most likely be welcomed back with open arms with the current dearth of statesmen and women. In this highly technologic age \u2014 with instant communication \u2014 it is simply not possible to maintain a position of isolationism. It did not work after either great war, and it will not work now. \u201cTake our country back!\u201d is one of Trump\u2019s jingoistic slogans, and it was also effective in the UK\u2019s recent vote.\n\nFeel as you may about President Barack Obama, but this country truly is much better off than it was when President George W. Bush left office, economically and as a member of the world community. He has strengthened ties throughout the world through diplomacy, which in the long run is a far better policy than the bullying, threatening, disgustingly rude stance of Donald Trump.\n\nThe United States will be the laughing stock of the world community if we elect a chief executive who cruelly ridicules disabled people, women, people of color and people of other nations. Have I left out other of his targets? But more frightening than having the world laugh at us, we will be distrusted, which will threaten our own security and that of our allies.\n\nThe British may indeed hold a second vote on the Brexit, if enough signatures are gathered to force it.\n\nHere in the United States, if we make a disastrous choice in November, we don\u2019t get a do-over. It is incumbent on those of us who value peace, stability, respect and security to ensure a huge turnout so that our voices are not drowned out by fear and hatred.\n\nJENNIFER A. WHITE\n\nYanceyville, North Carolina",
