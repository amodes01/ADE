    "text": "Warren Buffett sounded like many investors when he was asked this spring whether the United Kingdom should leave the European Union.\n\n\u201cI hope they stay in, but they have to make their decision, obviously, based on what they think is best for the U.K.,\u201d Buffett told Becky Quick on CNBC during an interview in Omaha.\n\nWhy should Britain stay in the EU?\n\nStability, said the chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. \u201cI\u2019m hoping the European Union works out well,\u201d and the more Europe \u201clearns to work together,\u201d the better.\n\n\u201cYou know, we started out in our own arrangement with 13 states and we had a lot of problems to work through,\u201d Buffett said. \u201c... It\u2019s up to the citizens of the U.K. to figure out what\u2019s the best for themselves. My hope is they stay in.\u201d\n\nIf Britain does leave the EU, he said, \u201cit won\u2019t make any difference to anything Berkshire does. I mean, if I was assured by (British Prime Minister David) Cameron that they were going to stay or leave, it wouldn\u2019t change one iota what I\u2019m doing in businesses or in stocks.\u201d\n\nIsraeli university benefits from shareholders\u2019 gift\n\nTwo longtime Berkshire shareholders are donating, posthumously, $400 million to Israel\u2019s Ben-Gurion University of the Negev.\n\nThe desert university said the money is from the estate of Dr. Howard and Lottie Marcus of San Diego. She died in Decem\n\nber at age 99, and he died in 2014 at age 104.\n\n\u201cI met Howard and Lottie more than 50 years ago through a mutual friend, my lifetime hero Ben Graham,\u201d Buffett told the university. \u201cWe hit it off, and they joined my investment partnership. Knowing them, it comes as no surprise that they elected to use their financial success to enhance the lives of thousands of Israeli young people.\u201d\n\nThe Marcuses had fled separately from Nazi Germany in the 1930s, but most members of their families died in the Holocaust. They met and married in New York City, Howard becoming a dentist and Lottie working in the secretarial pool at a Wall Street firm where she met Graham.\n\nAccording to the university, Graham told the Marcuses that one of his students at Columbia University was a prodigy and introduced them to Buffett. They put most of their nest egg into the partnership and later shifted it to Berkshire, leaving it there to accumulate.\n\nTheir donation will more than double the university\u2019s permanent endowment, the university said, calling it the largest bequest to an Israeli university and possibly the largest donation ever made to any institution in Israel.\n\nThe Marcuses had supported the university\u2019s research into water, desalination and desert studies since 1997, including a laboratory and scholarships. They believed that solving problems with water is the key to peace in the Middle East.\n\nThe university gave the couple honorary doctorates in 2004 and named its campus in Beer-Sheva after them in 2005. Said university President Rivka Carmi:\n\n\u201cHoward and Lottie Marcus were rare and special people, Holocaust survivors who lived a simple and humble life and joined their fate and their legacy to that of the State of Israel. Just as they viewed their fortune as merely a way to fulfill a greater mission, so, too, were they themselves larger than life.\u201d\n\nInfluential research\n\nA five-member research group funded by the Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation was instrumental in last month\u2019s U.S. Supreme Court ruling that struck down a Texas law on abortion clinics, Bloomberg News reported.\n\nThe foundation, named after Buffett\u2019s late wife and funded by him, supported the Texas Policy Evaluation Project, known as TxPEP, Bloomberg\u2019s Esm\u00e9 E. Deprez reported.\n\nThe project at the University of Texas at Austin studied the impact of reproductive health laws passed in Texas, gathering data from abortion providers, public records and interviews with women.\n\nTheir findings supported the argument that the Texas law in question, which required abortion clinics to be affiliated with hospitals, among other rules, created outsized burdens for women seeking a medical procedure that is legal.\n\nBloomberg said the court referenced TxPEP\u2019s findings in its decision, and the group\u2019s principal investigator, Dan Grossman, was an expert witness in the case.\n\nThe group was formed in 2011 after Texas legislators cut the state\u2019s family-planning budget, and then studied the effects of the 2013 law that was the subject of the latest ruling.\n\n\u201cTxPEP was able to collect and analyze Texas-specific data about the impact of this law in real time,\u201d said Stephanie Toti, the Center for Reproductive Rights attorney who argued before the Supreme Court.\n\nThe research group has received $4.6 million in private funding and is applying for grants through 2019, the story said.\n\nBloomberg said the group\u2019s research showed that the law, although only parts were in effect because of a court order, required women to pay more, travel farther and wait longer for abortions, pushing some to obtain later abortions or to try self-induced abortions.\n\nThe Buffett Foundation has a long history of support for women\u2019s reproductive rights, including contributions that helped make the morning-after birth-control pill widely available.\n\nCelebrating Kraft Heinz\n\nThere was plenty of criticism in Pittsburgh of Berkshire and its investment partner 3G Capital of Brazil when they began cutting costs after buying H.J. Heinz Co. in 2013.\n\nFood processing plants closed, jobs went away, top management was replaced and the company became privately owned.\n\nThen 3G and Berkshire bought Kraft Foods, merged it with Heinz and sold shares to the public, with the headquarters of Kraft Heinz Co. in Pittsburgh, not far from where Heinz was formed as a horseradish maker 147 years ago.\n\nNow the Pittsburgh Business Times is celebrating Kraft Heinz as the city\u2019s largest publicly traded corporation, with $18.3 billion in annual revenue.\n\nHeinz jumped to the top of the list over U.S. Steel and PPG Industries, the glass and coatings manufacturer, thanks to the Kraft merger, which nearly doubled its revenue, the Times said.\n\nDispute in Texas\n\nBerkshire\u2019s ownership of McLane Co. and stock holdings in Walmart Inc. are in conflict in Texas.\n\nMcLane, which delivers a wide range of consumer goods to retailers nationally, is suing the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission for barring it from distributing alcoholic beverages in the state.\n\nAccording to the beverage industry website Shanken News Daily, McLane argues that the commission was wrong in denying a distribution license based on its rule against overlapping ownerships among alcohol producers, distributors and retailers.\n\nBerkshire owns McLane outright and holds a 2 percent stake in Walmart Stores.\n\nMcLane argues that other states prohibit such arrangements only if one tier in the alcohol business controls or influences the business activities of another. And other companies with similar ownership arrangements have been granted distribution licenses, McLane argues.\n\nMcLane has $48 billion in annual sales and distributes alcohol products in Colorado, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and Tennessee. A commission official declined to comment.\n\nThe Omaha World-Herald is owned by Berkshire Hathaway Inc.\n\nCan't see the chat, app users? Click here.",
