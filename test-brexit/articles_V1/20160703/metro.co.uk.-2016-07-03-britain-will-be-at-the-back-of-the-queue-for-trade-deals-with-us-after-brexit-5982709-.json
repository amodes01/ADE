    "text": "Matthew Barzun, US ambassador to the United Kingdom (Picture: Rex)\n\nAnyone listening to Desert Island Discs today will have heard more than just how great Prince\u2019s song Delirious is.\n\nUS Ambassador Matthew Barzun, today\u2019s guest, also discussed the reality of trade post-Brexit.\n\nHe said that President Obama had been right to warn in April that Britain would go \u2018to the back of the queue\u2019 when it comes to negotiating trade deals.\n\nBefore voting for Brexit, the UK was at the front as it was part of the EU which is currently hammering out a major deal with the USA known as the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, or TTIP.\n\nBut now we have effectively given up our place in the line, he said.\n\nObama warned Brexit could hurt trade (Picture: Saul Loeb/Pool via Bloomberg)\n\nMORE : Boris Johnson lookalike forced to wear \u2018I\u2019m not Boris\u2019 t-shirt\n\n\u2018If you step out of the front of the queue, by definition you are no longer at the front and some notion that you can jump further ahead; you just want to say that is not the trend for the types of big deals we are doing these days,\u2019 he said.\n\nHouse of Cards creator doesn\u2019t think UK politics is worthy of comparison to show But the \u2018special relationship\u2019 between the two countries would remain, he said.\n\n\u2018I think we did what best friends do. So before the referendum when we were asked \u2013 and President Obama said it probably most forcibly \u2013 of course, it\u2019s up to you but if you ask us, we will tell you what we think which was we value a strong UK in a strong EU.\u2019\n\nThe interview was recorded after the referendum results and broadcast today.\n\nHowever, others have claimed trade prospects with the US are looking hopeful, citing a bill calling for a new trade deal proposed by Republican politicians.\n\nUS-UK Free Trade Agreement gathering momentum.
