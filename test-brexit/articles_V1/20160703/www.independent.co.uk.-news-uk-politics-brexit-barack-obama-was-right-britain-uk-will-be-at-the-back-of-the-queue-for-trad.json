The UK is going to be in the back of the queue.\u201d\n\nMr Obama also advised the British electorate against voting to leave the EU, saying: \u201cIf, right now, I have got access to a massive market where I sell 44 per cent of my exports and now I'm thinking about leaving the organisation that gives me access to that market and that is responsible for millions of jobs in my country and responsible for an enormous amount of commerce and upon which a lot of businesses depend \u2013 that's not something I would probably do.\u201d\n\nBrexit campaigners dismissed the warning, however, with Nigel Farage accusing Mr Cameron of putting words in the US President\u2019s mouth and Leave.Eu co-founder Richard Tice insisting: \u201cObama doesn\u2019t have the authority to deny us a deal, as he will be long gone before any such proposals are on the table.\"\n\nMr Barzun, who helped orchestrate the grassroots campaign that was a key part of Mr Obama\u2019s first presidential election victory in 2008, told Desert Island Discs that the President had felt compelled to warn about Brexit because of the special relationship between the UK and the US.\n\n\u201cWe did what best friends do,\u201d said Mr Barzun, 45. \u201cSo before the referendum when we were asked \u2013 and President Obama said it probably most forcibly \u2013 [we said] of course, it\u2019s up to you but if you ask us, we will tell you what we think, which was: \u2018We value a strong UK in a strong EU.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat friends should do to each other,\u201d he added, \u201cis to be honest.\u201d\n\nBut in the interview, which was broadcast today, Mr Barzun did also insist that the special relationship would survive Brexit.\n\n\u201cIt sure is still special,\u201d he told presenter Kirsty Young. \u201cI think we are best friends, as it were, as countries.\n\n\u201cYou think about the cultural, the commercial, the emotional and the intellectual connections between our countries. Those are unbreakable. Not unbreakable because they are some rigid thing. The opposite. They are unbreakable because they are flexible.\u201d",
