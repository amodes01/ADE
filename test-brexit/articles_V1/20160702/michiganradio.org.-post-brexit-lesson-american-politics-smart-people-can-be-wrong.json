    "text": "Don\u2019t believe the smart folks who say Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union, and the wild show that passes for American presidential politics today, are just evidence of one big, transatlantic hissy fit. They\u2019re wrong.\n\nRepublican and Democratic leaders here, political classes on both sides of the pond and financial markets around the globe are demonstrating, once again, a remarkable disconnect from the concerns of everyday people from Liverpool to Lansing.\n\nImagine that. Nearly 52 percent of Britons voted to leave the EU, a move the smart set did not fully anticipate. That\u2019s because they figured a majority wouldn\u2019t summon the gumption to make it. The so-called \u201cBrexit\u201d vote promises to shake the post-war global order, to reshape financial markets and to shift security alliances amid an unnerving geopolitical vacuum.\n\nThe Brits are not alone. Their decision presages the fraught choice implicit in the cage match between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump: how populism and false promises, offered by equally flawed candidates, can be packaged into a political balm both sides can sell to folks suspicious of elites.\n\nDelivering the promises is another thing entirely. Britons are learning that bitter lesson quickly as asset values swoon, markets gyrate and politicians on the left and the right show they really don\u2019t have a plan to deliver Great Britain 2.0. We could be next.\n\nElections have consequences. Multinational corporations like Detroit\u2019s Big Two automakers and Wall Street investment houses are rethinking their presence in the United Kingdom. Standard & Poor\u2019s stripped the U.K. of its triple-A credit rating. Political parties there are in chaos. And what passes for British government is mulling methods to leave the EU, if any.\n\nAll of it promises uncertainty for business and for economic growth. It means reappraisal for global companies deeply planted in an EU that for too long denied the possibility that a Britain divided over immigration and badgering from Brussels actually would bolt.\n\nA majority of Britons proved the smart people wrong. The vote is non-binding, legally speaking. But the message to the political class is undeniable: what about us?\n\nThat\u2019s the same question Trump supporters are asking. It\u2019s the same question Bernie Sanders asked again and again during the Democratic primaries\u2014and clearly intends to take to the party\u2019s convention in Philadelphia.\n\nWhat about the people who heard the rationales for trade deals, but paid for them with lost jobs and communities? What about the people who lost retirement savings and property values to a global financial meltdown they did not cause?\n\nThe vote is non-binding, legally speaking. But the message to the political class is undeniable: what about us?\n\nWhat about the people increasingly fearful the disorder in Syria and Iraq will visit their shores in the form of terrorism\u2014chiefly because of the maddeningly mixed signals their leaders send on immigration and security?\n\nIt\u2019s too soon to answer those questions, or know how they\u2019ll play before American voters. But it\u2019s not too soon to acknowledge that history and a reassertion of sovereignty can trump transnationalism and confound elites\u2014because in Britain they just did.\n\nDaniel Howes is a columnist at The Detroit News.
