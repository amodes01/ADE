    "text": "President Barack Obama is backtracking on his warning that Britain would go to the \u201cback of the queue\u201d for a US trade deal, as he tries to contain the fallout of the UK\u2019s decision to leave the European Union\n\nWashington: President Barack Obama is backtracking on his warning that Britain would go to the \u201cback of the queue\u201d for a US trade deal, as he tries to contain the fallout of the UK\u2019s decision to leave the European Union.\n\nThe shift in tone illustrates how Britain\u2019s vote has abruptly scrambled Obama\u2019s reality. Where the president had tried to encourage the UK not to rashly abandon the European bloc, he now must reassure Britain that its decision to do so won\u2019t mean its demise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHis priority of locking in trade deals before leaving office now becomes a distant second, behind the more urgent task of restoring confidence in the financial markets and in Europe\u2019s future.\n\n\u201cThe Obama administration and a number of leaders in Europe as well is trying to calm the waters. At this point, there are more questions than answers,\u201d said Miriam Sapiro, Obama\u2019s former acting trade representative and now an adviser at the strategy firm Finsbury.\n\nObama\u2019s attempt to show support for a struggling ally casts him in the role of forceful free-trade advocate at a time when all of the major presidential candidates running to replace him are vocally opposed.\n\nYet current and former Obama administration officials are operating under the assumption that Democrat Hillary Clinton, if elected, would come around to supporting Obama\u2019s trade deals after finding ways to reconcile specific concerns she\u2019s raised about jobs, wages and national security.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBefore Britain\u2019s exit vote, or Brexit, Obama\u2019s administration was deep in negotiations toward a sweeping free trade deal with the 28-nation EU. Supporters of the Brexit had argued the UK wouldn\u2019t lose out on US commerce because it could easily broker a one-on-one deal with the US. So during a visit to London in April, Obama sought to correct the record, arguing that wouldn\u2019t \u201chappen any time soon.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nObama\u2019s warning reflected his broader belief that separate trade deals with individual countries are too laborious, given the countless regulations, laws and standards that must be aligned to create a free trade zone.\n\nInstead, Obama has sought to broker broad deals with universal requirements, so that any country that agrees to the conditions can join. His 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership with Asia, awaiting ratification in Congress, is a prime example of that multi-member approach.",
