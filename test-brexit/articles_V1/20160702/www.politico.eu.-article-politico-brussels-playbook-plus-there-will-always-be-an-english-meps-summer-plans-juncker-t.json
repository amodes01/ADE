    "text": "ENGLISH HERE TO STAY, AY: Lots of rumors (or rumours, if you insist) have been circulating about the status of the English language in the EU, mostly initiated by French wishful thinkers. On Monday Danuta H\u00fcbner, a Polish MEP who chairs the European Parliament\u2019s constitutional affairs committee, said English would cease to be an official language because each member country gets to choose one and Ireland had specified Gaelic. But the European Commission representation in Ireland quickly shot that down, saying a change to official EU languages requires unanimity from all members. That means the only way to have English dropped from the list would be for the remaining 27 countries to agree. Given that English is one of the official languages in both Ireland and Malta, and much beloved by countries and peoples to the north, east and south of France, we don\u2019t see this happening any time soon. The United Kingdom may be about to crumble, but the sun never sets on the English language empire!\n\nEURO-POLS HEADING TO CLINTON AND TRUMP CONVENTIONS: Thirty members of the European Parliament are heading to the U.S. to take part in the Republican and Democratic National Conventions next month, according an internal Parliament memo. Fourteen MEPs from the European Conservatives and Reformists Group \u2014 including leader Syed Kamall and outspoken Brexiteer Daniel Hannan \u2014 are heading to Cleveland to be part of the Donald Trump bonanza. The only other EU political faction making the trip to the GOP convention will be the center-right European People\u2019s Party, represented by Secretary-General Antonio L\u00f3pez-Ist\u00fariz White. Five MEPs from the EPP group, including possible Parliament presidential candidate Mairead McGuinness and veteran MEP Elmar Brok, will go to the Hillary Clinton confab in Philadelphia. Also planning a trip to Philly are four Socialist members, including group leader Gianni Pittella, two MEPs from the Liberals, one Green and two members of the European Parliament secretariat.\n\nJUNCKER\u2019S KANYE MOMENT: Jean-Claude Juncker had a lot to say Tuesday, at Parliament, mingling with journalists, around the summit table, at the podium. Some of it sounded like this Kanye West rant: \u201cI have ideas that can make the human race existence within our 100 years better. Period.\u201d Here are some gems from the Commission president, defending his job:",
