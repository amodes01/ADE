    "text": "Washington, DC \u2013 The National Black Church Initiative (NBCI), a faith-based coalition of 34,000 churches comprised of 15 denominations and 15.7 million African Americans, is shocked to know that white Europeans are willing to destroy their own country to underscore their racist nature against immigrants and against the inevitably changing waves of societies into a more pluralistic one. It is foolish to think that the Brits believe that a vote to leave the European Union will not have catastrophic implications and sends a raw and negative\n\nmessage to the world that they are willing to undermine the 28 member states just to say to the world that only white Europeans should control Britain. The vote will undermine 23 years of hard work between member states to build an economic unit that will compete on a global basis with the likes of the United States, Canada, China, Brazil, Russia, Japan and other nations around the world.\n\nThe whites of Britain are reflecting a sentiment that the 1% and the politicians that serve them are stealing their country from right under their noses. BREXIT is a radical reaction to this sense of cultural theft by the politicians and the 1%. The Arab Spring and the revoked around the world gives credence to this feeling that the general population is being ignored for those who have wealth and privilege. Many historians and clergy say that history repeats itself. Could we be witnessing a new form of the French Revolution?\n\nThis sort of knee-jerk racist attitude clearly underlines and calls into question the stability of the world when we are facing global warming, terrorism, and disease and poverty and war at unbelievable levels. The answer is not to close yourself off but to come together to face these problems as a unified unit, but the BREXIT vote has called into question once again, man\u2019s inhumanity to man and also calls into question the frequently liberal European view of themselves who at their core are racist and anti-immigrant.\n\nRev. Anthony Evans, President of the National Black Church Initiative says, \u201cUpon the election of Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, Tony Blair and David Cameron the world truly believed they were ushering in a new era of leadership that stood for equality, inclusiveness and a post-racial and colonial world. After the demise of Tony Blair and the embarrassment of Bill Clinton and the sunset on the Presidency of Barack Obama and the Prime Minister-ship of David Cameron the only thing one can conclude that these new styles of leadership brought forth was moral chaos, economic uproar and a culture of terror unmatched in human history as the world sought to separate the good Muslims from the bad ones. BREXIT underscores, in a deep and abiding way, the depth of the divisions between religions, cultures and societies that threatens the very existence of us all as peace loving people around the world. It seems as though these leaders have brought no more stability and global vision to the world than the dictators who have reigned for years. What\u2019s the difference if you\u2019re suffering under a democracy rather than a dictator?\u201d\n\nThis is an experiment that is going to cause upheaval for the poor of Europe and have unintended consequences economically for the British people themselves. The Church can only view this as selfish to a degree unmatched in human history, as someone willing to blow everybody up with themselves to make a point of independence. As Charles Adams would say, the pastor of Hartford Memorial in Detroit, \u201cHow foolish one can be.\u201d\n\nABOUT NBCI\n\nThe National Black Church Initiative (NBCI) is a coalition of 34,000 African American and Latino churches working to eradicate racial disparities in healthcare, technology, education, housing, and the environment.
