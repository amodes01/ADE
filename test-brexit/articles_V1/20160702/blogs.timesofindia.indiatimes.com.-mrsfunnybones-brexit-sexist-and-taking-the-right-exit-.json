    "text": "Twinkle Khanna aka Mrs Funnybones crafts satirical stories and funny fables when she is not running a design business, selling candles or running in circles around her small but rather odd family. She narrowly escaped a gruesome tragedy when Bollywood tried to bludgeon her brain to the size of a pea, but she ducked at the right moment and escaped miraculously unharmed; she is now a popular columnist as well and is currently in the process of creating lame jokes like ' Why do all Hindu boys worship their mother? Because their religion tells them to worship the cow.' She firmly believes that nothing in life is sacred except laughter. (Not even her name, which she is secretly trying to change to Chetali Bhagat so that her columns get made into movies.) LESS ... MORE\n\nThursday: The man of the house does not like driving, especially along these alien Italian roads, and when I say, \u2018Take that left exit!\u2019 he ignores me.\n\nAfter driving around in five circles, we realize that as usual I was right and the left exit was indeed the right one. This revelation leads to a massive argument till the prodigal son chirps up, \u2018Dad! Mom is just cranky, she must be getting her period. You know how she gets!\u2019\n\nTo which I roar, \u2018That is sexist! Every time a woman is upset it\u2019s not because of her hormones! And if it were not for my periods, you would not be sitting in this car with that chocolate bar in your hand, mister!\u2019\n\nThe prodigal son splutters, \u2018Mom, that\u2019s really unfair! I told you that I totally believe in gender equality when we had classes on that topic last semester. I just made a calculated deduction. See, your stomach is poking out a bit, you have a pimple on your chin, and you have been very irritable!\u2019\n\n\u2018What are you, ACP Pradyuman from that CID show?\u2019 I holler, \u2018Mind your own business!\u2019\n\nUnfortunately, the prodigal son has the last laugh because just by sheer coincidence, an hour later, my body decides to give me its very own communist greeting with a cheery \u2018Lal Salaam!\u2019 And we have to make an emergency stop at the nearest pharmacy.\n\nFriday: Sipping a cup of peppermint tea as tiny brown birds try to get at bits of jam and bread on our table, I get the news that like my teabag, Britain is also up to its neck in hot water.\n\n\u2018Brexit is a reality!\u2019 scream headlines and as people at the tables around us begin diluting their fresh orange juice with tears, watching their shares in Barclays and Lloyds drop down the rabbit hole, my friend\u2019s maasi, Daljeet Aunty, who has just joined us after a week in England, says, \u2018Sanu ki! I was just telling your uncle, as it is we had to get solo visa for England, this Europe wala Schengen visa doesn\u2019t work there, so we Indians are in same position like before only, of standing with folded hands at UK embassy, na? I toh wish this break-up shake-up would have happened a week earlier, then with the pound dropping, I would have got all my Marks things at half the rate. One thing is there, today you people are saying British are fools, but no one makes brassieres better than their Marks and Spencer, it is still world best in underclothes only!\u2019\n\nWe then leave the consequences of Brexit along with our breakfast table to drive from Italy to Switzerland with just a nonchalant wave to the lone guard standing at the border gate. Long live the European Union!\n\nSaturday: It\u2019s been a month of exits in India as Raghuram Rajan steps down as RBI governor and finance minister Arun Jaitley makes a hasty departure from China.\n\nThe person partly responsible for both seems to be BJP MP Subramanian Swamy who first declared that Mr Rajan was \u2018mentally not Indian enough\u2019 and then launched another missile at Mr Jaitley\u2019s sartorial style by stating that ministers should wear Indian clothes while abroad as they look like waiters in a coat and tie.\n\nMr Swamy then, according to unreliable sources, closely watched Ruby Rai, the 12th standard humanities topper from Bihar who got arrested after a TV interview where she said political science, a subject she aced, teaches cooking! In the re-exam where she was asked to write an essay on Tulsidas, she decided to respectfully write down the only thing she knew, \u2018Tulsidasji, Pranam.\u2019 Ruby Rai later confessed that it was all her father\u2019s fault; she had merely asked him to bribe and make her pass the exams but Daddyji had made her a topper instead.\n\nMr Swamy quickly added up 4+2 and came up with Char Sau Bees and declared that in Mr Arvind Kejriwal\u2019s case also it was his Daddyji who was responsible for his admission into IIT, a ploy to harass Mr Kejriwal on different issues till he too makes a hasty exit from his post.\n\nMr Swamy is a relentless warrior, who randomly slings disconnected weapons around in a wide arc, hoping that at least one of his rocks will land on someone, anyone\u2019s head.\n\nI would not be surprised if Mr Swamy now blames Brexit on Vijay Mallya\u2019s settling down in England a few months ago, by tweeting to his 2.8 million followers, \u2018Midas touched anything and it turned to gold, Mallya touches anything and it folds #Brexit\u2019.\n\nSunday: We have now reached New York and I decide to spend my time perfecting the art of window shopping. Walking down Fifth Avenue, I pass Trump Tower and see a crowd holding up signs, \u2018Vote for Trump, He is the savior and Hillary is a cheat!\u2019\n\nWhen I get home and tell the man of the house, he shows me a WhatsApp forward: \u2018US and UK are in a competition as to who is Dumb and who is Dumber, UK is in the lead but fear not the US has a Trump card.\u2019\n\nI begin giggling and like most Indians who deep down have always felt a bit intimidated by the Brits and the Yanks, as we grapple with their language trying to make it our own, I am secretly relieved.\n\nIt is finally apparent that those with the impeccable clipped accents or suave drawls are not so sagacious after all, and perhaps this clear display is enough for us Indians to make a hasty exit from our age-old inferiority complex as well.\n\nFacebook Twitter Linkedin Email Disclaimer Views expressed above are the author's own.",
