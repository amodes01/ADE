    "text": "Washington DC\n\nJuly 1. 2016\n\nBoris Johnson\u2013The BREXIT Buffoon\n\nby D. D. Guttenplan*\n\nTHE problem with spending your whole life pretending to be a buffoon is that eventually people start to believe you.\n\nThe British are spared of this Brexit Buffoon\n\nBack in April, when the possibility of Britain actually voting to leave the European Union seemed remote, two newspapers commissioned a poll asking which political figure readers would most like to dine with. Boris Johnson, who had recently announced his support for Brexit, was the winner by a wide margin: 38 percent of respondents said they\u2019d prefer his company, compared with 18 percent for the Labour Party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, and just 12 percent for the Conservative Prime Minister, David Cameron.\n\nThis morning, I found myself wondering how many had changed their minds, for Mr. Johnson \u2014 or Boris, as he\u2019s universally known here \u2014 now seems more like the sort of date who\u2019d order a lavish meal and the best wine on the menu and then walk out, leaving his companions with the check.\n\nA week ago Britain had the fifth largest economy in the world. By the weekend, after Britons had voted by a margin of 52 percent to 48 percent to leave the European Union, it had slipped to sixth place, behind France. Mr. Cameron, who had staked his political future on the vote, resigned.His successor, it was widely assumed, would be Boris Johnson.\n\nThe tousled blond figurehead of the Leave campaign had been seen as prime minister in waiting since his return to Parliament last year. He and Michael Gove \u2014 like Mr. Johnson, a journalist turned Tory politician \u2014 were the intellectual heavyweights of the campaign, widely expected to become next-door neighbors in government, with Mr. Johnson as Prime Minister at No. 10 Downing Street and the Goves in No. 11, the residence of the Chancellor of the Exchequer.\n\nMichael and Sarah G0ve\n\nThe Goves had other ideas. On Wednesday, Mr. Gove\u2019s wife, Sarah Vine, a columnist for The Daily Mail, inadvertently leaked an email indicating her distrust of Mr. Johnson. \u201cYou MUST have SPECIFIC assurances from Boris OTHERWISE you cannot guarantee your support,\u201d she admonished her husband. She also reminded him that both Paul Dacre, The Mail\u2019s powerful editor, and Rupert Murdoch \u201cinstinctively dislike Boris but trust your ability enough to support a Boris Gove ticket.\u201d (Before he became a member of Parliament, Mr. Gove was an editorial writer for Mr. Murdoch\u2019s Times).\n\nYet in her own column that day, Ms. Vine gave no hint that Mr. Gove had any plan to supplant Mr. Johnson as favorite to be the next Conservative leader and Prime Minister. The same could hardly be said of Boris, whose ambition was as broad as his indiscretions.\n\nPlaying the clown served Mr. Johnson well, though. It created a cushion of public indulgence around his persona, even as the Old Etonian plotted his next career move. The young reporter who was fired by The Times in 1988 for fabricating a quotation became the editor of The Spectator in 1999. The newspaper columnist who in 2002 wrote scornfully of \u201cflag-waving piccaninnies\u201d with \u201cwatermelon smiles\u201d was elected mayor of one of the most diverse and cosmopolitan cities in the world in 2008.\n\nAlong the way, he fathered two children out of wedlock. In 2013, an Appeal Court castigated him for the \u201creckless\u201d conduct of his \u201cphilandering.\u201d\n\nWe can\u2019t say we weren\u2019t warned. When Mr. Johnson took over at The Spectator, his friend and biographer, the political journalist Andrew Gimson, remarked that it was like \u201centrusting a Ming vase to an ape.\u201d Somehow, though, none of the buffoonery or scandal slowed him down. It was just Boris being Boris.\n\nHe even got away with an extraordinary degree of flip-flopping on Brexit: from \u201cfinely balanced\u201d in February to all-out in April to his latest, post-referendum column for The Daily Telegraph, in which he assured readers that \u201cBritain is part of Europe, and always will be.\u201d\n\nRecklessness doesn\u2019t get near it. On Thursday morning, after destroying the political career of his old school chum Mr. Cameron, wrecking the British economy and possibly breaking up Britain, Mr. Johnson announced that he wouldn\u2019t be sticking around to clean up the mess he\u2019d made. His erstwhile ally, Mr. Gove, delivered the coup de gr\u00e2ce as he announced his own candidacy for the Conservative leadership: \u201cBoris cannot provide the leadership or build the team for the task ahead.\u201d\n\nUntil yesterday, Mr. Johnson seemed to have an ability to outrun boring facts and bad publicity only surpassed, perhaps, by one Donald J. Trump. Boris will not be Britain\u2019s prime minister any time soon, and probably never, so what next?\n\nA break from British politics seems like a good idea. Although he gave up his American passport to avoid paying taxes, Mr. Johnson was actually born in New York City. Perhaps Mr. Trump would take him on as a warm-up act \u2014 or even a running mate.\n\n*D. D. Guttenplan is The Nation\u2019s editor at large.\n\nA version of this op-ed appears in print on July 1, 2016, on page A23 of the New York edition with the headline: Boris the Clown Bows Out.
