    "text": "GETTY FILE PICTURE More than five schoolchildren are reported every day under the Government legislation\n\nThe child was reported under Prevent legislation, which aims to target radicalisation in schools by giving teachers the power to blow the whistle on suspected radicalised behaviour. The boy\u2019s parents have expressed their outrage that their son was \u201csingled out\u201d by staff at Teesville primary school, Middlesborough. The father of the child, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said: \u201cWe have been informed that they will be reported to the relevant authorities for radicalisation and being racist. \u201cThe school in question was talking about how the exit from the EU would effect our country.\n\nGETTY Theresa May has pushed forward the campaign to get schools working under Prevent legislation\n\n\u201cMy child said 'It would stop refugees and immigrants coming in or leaving the country' which has been said numerous times in the news and social media since the referendum result. \u201cOne thing for certain is that my child, me or his mum are not racist in any way shape or form. \u201cWe are fuming that the school has taken this action against our child who is the most caring and great child a father could want. \u201cWe are not happy that they have been singled out in this way.\u201d\n\nMore than five schoolchildren are reported every day under the Government counter-terrorism legislation. Last year 1,041 youngsters were flagged up as at risk of being drawn into terrorism and were subsequently referred to authorities through the counter-extremism programme. The total \u2013 the equivalent of more than five per school day \u2013 represents a huge increase from the legislation\u2019s first year of nationwide operation in 2012, when just nine children were reported. The deputy head of Teesville Primary said the incident was \u201ca minor issue that was dealt with internally.\u201d\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.
