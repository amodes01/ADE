    "text": "Queen Elizabeth II avoided making any direct comments on last week\u2019s historic Brexit vote as she opened a new session of the Scottish Parliament, but stressed the importance of staying \u201ccalm and collected\u201d in a \u201ccomplex and demanding\u201d world.\n\nThis marked the fifth term of Scottish Parliament formally opened by Britain\u2019s head of state in Edinburgh. This session comes at a rather turbulent time, politically speaking.\n\nThe Queen remained true to the practice of royal neutrality and did not mention the Brexit referendum despite being given the opening to do so by Holyrood\u2019s presiding officer, Ken MacIntosh, who brought up Brexit in his introduction of the monarch, noting that the last few \u201cweeks of unprecedented political turbulence\u201d had \u201cborne witness to the politics of hate.\u201d\n\nHe also referred specifically to the murder of Labour MP Jo Cox and the mass shooting at a gay nightclub in the US city of Orlando before asking her majesty to address the parliament.\n\nThe Queen avoided mentioning any of these issues explicitly, but did call on political leaders to take time for \u201ccontemplation.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course we all live and work in an increasingly complex and demanding world, where events and developments can and do take place at remarkable speed. And retaining the ability to stay calm and collected can at times be hard.\n\n\u201cAs this parliament has successfully demonstrated over the years, one hallmark of leadership in such a fast moving world is allowing sufficient room for quiet thinking and contemplation, which can enable deeper, cooler consideration of how challenges and opportunities can be best addressed.\u201d\n\nDespite the challenges that lay ahead of the Scottish Parliament, MacIntosh\u2019s speech was one full of optimism. \u201cWe have five years to make a difference, five years to make Scotland a fairer, kinder and more prosperous country, five years to build a better place for us all to live, government or opposition, front or back bench, each one of us has something to contribute,\u201d he said.\n\nMacIntosh also echoed the words of the late Jo Cox, saying \u201cWe have far more in common than what divides us.\u201d\n\nScotland\u2019s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, looked to the future positively as well at a time when she is facing a fight to secure Scotland\u2019s relationship with the EU.\n\nThe majority of people in Scotland voted to remain in the EU, and Sturgeon has said that a new referendum on Scottish independence is \u201chighly likely\u201d to take place.\n\nREAD MORE: Scotland\u2019s Sturgeon hits dead end in talks on EU status\n\nShe told parliament that MSPs had been given the \u201cprecious opportunity to contribute to building a better country \u2013 and build it we will.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo do so we must be bold and ambitious. We must show courage and determination. Our collective commitment to the people of Scotland today is that we will not shy away from any challenge we face, no matter how difficult or deep-rooted,\u201d she added.\n\nSturgeon noted that Scots come from a wealth of nations and it is a \u201cprivilege\u201d to have them living here.\n\n\u201cWe are so much stronger for the diversity that shapes us, we are one Scotland and we are simply home to all those who have chosen to live here,\u201d she said.\n\nMeanwhile tens of thousands have taken part in the March for Europe in London on Saturday, calling for Britain to remain part of the EU.\n\nREAD MORE: Anti-Brexit protesters hit streets of UK capital London",
