    "text": "The Brexit vote has armed campaigners across the Atlantic with fresh belief that they too can throw off the yoke of an outdated union that is holding them back: the United States of America.\n\nFrom New England in the east to the Pacific coast in the west, American secessionist groups have reported a surge of interest in their cause after last Thursday\u2019s decision by the UK to break away from the European Union.\n\nThe biggest impact has been felt in Texas, where everything is supersized and brashly confident, including the separatist fringe. The hashtag \u201cTexit\u201d has been trending on social media although one Twitter user, who perhaps takes the campaign less seriously than its organisers, suggested the biblically resonant \u201cTexodus\u201d instead.\n\nAfter the Brexit results",
