    "text": "The Brexit vote was a triple protest: Against surging immigration, City of London bankers, and European Union institutions, in that order. It will have major consequences. Donald Trump\u2019s campaign for the US presidency will receive a huge boost, as will other anti-immigrant populist politicians. Moreover, leaving the EU will wound the British economy, and could well push Scotland to leave the United Kingdom \u2014 to say nothing of Brexit\u2019s ramifications for the future of European integration. A man closes his umbrella designed like the British flag as he enters a taxi with his companion during a downpour in Hong Kong(AFP)\n\nAt its core, Brexit reflects a pervasive phenomenon in the high-income world: Rising support for populist parties campaigning for a clampdown on immigration. Roughly half the population in Europe and the United States, generally working-class voters, believes that immigration is out of control, posing a threat to public order and cultural norms.\n\nRead: British PM hopeful Gove says no EU exit talks this year\n\nIn the middle of the Brexit campaign in May, it was reported that the UK had net immigration of 333,000 persons in 2015, more than triple the government\u2019s previously announced target of 100,000. Warnings that Brexit would lower income levels were either dismissed outright, wrongly, as mere fearmongering, or weighed against the Leavers\u2019 greater interest in border control. A major factor, however, was implicit class warfare. Working-class \u201cLeave\u201d voters reasoned that most or all of the income losses would in any event be borne by the rich, and especially the despised bankers of the City of London.\n\nAmericans disdain Wall Street and its greedy and often criminal behaviour at least as much as the British working class disdains the City of London. This, too, suggests a campaign advantage for Trump over his opponent in November, Hillary Clinton, whose candidacy is heavily financed by Wall Street. Clinton should take note and distance herself from Wall Street.\n\nRead: Seeking post-Brexit calm, Obama walks back UK trade warning\n\nIn the UK, these two powerful political currents \u2014 rejection of immigration and class warfare \u2014 were joined by the widespread sentiment that EU institutions are dysfunctional. They surely are. One need only cite the last six years of mismanagement of the Greek crisis by self-serving, shortsighted European politicians.\n\nThe short-run consequences of Brexit are already clear: the pound has plummeted to a 31-year low. In the near term, the City of London will face major uncertainties, job losses, and a collapse of bonuses. Property values in London will cool. The possible longer-run knock-on effects in Europe \u2014 including likely Scottish independence; possible Catalonian independence; a breakdown of free movement of people in the EU; a surge in anti-immigrant politics (including the possible election of Trump and France\u2019s Marine Le Pen) \u2014 are enormous.\n\nSo what should be done? I would suggest several measures, both to reduce the risks of catastrophic feedback loops in the short term and to maximise the benefits of reform in the long term.\n\nFirst, stop the refugee surge by ending the Syrian war immediately. This can be accomplished by ending the CIA-Saudi alliance to overthrow Bashar al-Assad, thereby enabling Assad (with Russian and Iranian backing) to defeat the Islamic State and stabilise Syria (with a similar approach in neighboring Iraq). America\u2019s addiction to regime change (in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, and Syria) is the deep cause of Europe\u2019s refugee crisis.\n\nSecond, stop NATO\u2019s expansion to Ukraine and Georgia. The new Cold War with Russia is another US-contrived blunder with plenty of European naivet\u00e9 attached. Closing the door on NATO expansion would make it possible to ease tensions and normalise relations with Russia, stabilise Ukraine, and restore focus on the European economy and the European project.\n\nThird, don\u2019t punish Britain. Instead, police national and EU borders to stop illegal migrants.\n\nRead: Britain at sea: Week after Brexit, political crisis grips country\n\nFourth, restore a sense of fairness and opportunity for the disaffected working class and those whose livelihoods have been undermined by financial crises and the outsourcing of jobs. This means following the social-democratic ethos of pursuing ample social spending for health, education, training, apprenticeships, and family support, financed by taxing the rich and closing tax havens, which are gutting public revenues and exacerbating economic injustice. It also means finally giving Greece debt relief, thereby ending the long-running eurozone crisis.\n\nFifth, focus resources, including additional aid, on economic development, rather than war, in low-income countries.\n\nAll of this underscores the need to shift from a strategy of war to one of sustainable development, especially by the US and Europe. Walls and fences won\u2019t stop millions of migrants fleeing violence, extreme poverty, hunger, disease, droughts, floods, and other ills. Only global cooperation can do that.\n\nCopyright: Project Syndicate, 2016.\n\nJeffrey D.
