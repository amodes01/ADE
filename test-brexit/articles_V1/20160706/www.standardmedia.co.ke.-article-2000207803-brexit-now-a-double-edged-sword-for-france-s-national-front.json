    "text": "Paris: Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union looks like a boost for France\u2019s eurosceptic National Front.\n\nBut that could turn to trouble for the party if voters see instability across the Channel when they elect a new president in 10 months\u2019 time.\n\nNational Front (FN) leader Marine Le Pen looked ecstatic as the Brexit result was announced, calling it a \u201cvictory for freedom\u201d that would soon be repeated in France, an EU-founding member whose voters are increasingly eurosceptic.\n\nAs the only major party in France that backed Brexit and is calling for a similar in-or-out referendum on EU membership, the FN has at first glance much to gain from a vote that thrust Europe to the center of France\u2019s 2017 election debate.\n\nThe party\u2019s vice-president Florian Philippot told Reuters. \u201cUp until now we were told that leaving the EU would be apocalyptic, that we\u2019d be isolated. Britain will show it\u2019s exactly the opposite.\u201d\n\nLike many of the Brexit campaigners, the FN banks on grassroot anger with elites, and is faring well in small towns and rural areas that feel forgotten by globalization, giving it hopes the Brexit vote will push even more working-class voters to vote for it next year. Opinion polls already show that the anti-immigration FN, whose ratings benefited from Europe\u2019s refugee crisis, is likely to top the first round of the presidential election.\n\n\u201cThe headlines are doing the FN\u2019s job for it, yet again,\u201d said sociologist Sylvain Crepon, an expert on the FN at the university of Tours.\n\nBut where the Brexit legacy stands as the French vote for a president on April 23 and May 7 next year will be key.\n\nThe Brexit vote has plunged Britain into political chaos. Prime Minister David Cameron announced he is standing down, opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn faces an open revolt by parliamentary colleagues and UKIP leader Nigel Farage, one of the most effective Brexit campaigners, said he is resigning.\n\nSharp drop\n\nThere has been a sharp drop in the pound and in British consumer confidence since the vote, while pro-EU Scotland is threatening to quit the United Kingdom.\n\n\u201cIf things go well (at the time of the French elections), the FN will benefit from it. If it\u2019s trench warfare, if banks are moving their headquarters away from Britain, if the British economy has taken a hit, the FN argument will be caught out,\u201d Ifop pollsters\u2019 analyst Jerome Fourquet said.\n\nThe FN\u2019s Philippot says much of the talk about negative consequences of Brexit \u201cis a refusal by the elite, especially in France, to accept reality.\u201d\n\nBut for Fourquet, \u201cif the political situation in Britain unravels, if Scotland wants to leave ... the FN\u2019s opponents will be able to say: \u2018See, we\u2019ve been telling you for years that the EU exit backed by Marine Le Pen, of which Brexit is a test case, is a failure.\u201d\n\nThere is early evidence in some other European countries that the Brexit vote and the political uncertainty it triggered in Britain may be denting parties that want to leave the bloc.\n\nSurveys conducted since the referendum have shown support for EU membership rising sharply in both Finland and Denmark.\n\n\u201cIf the chaos we are witnessing in the UK at the moment makes others think twice about leaving, that is not a bad thing,\u201d an aide to German Chancellor Angela Merkel told Reuters.\n\nIt is unsure at this stage how clear the consequences of Brexit will be in 10 months\u2019 time, or whether the divorce talks will have started.\n\nHow Donald Trump\u2019s populist, anti-Washington message fares in U.S. election in November and whether the far-right wins in the October re-run of Austria\u2019s presidential election - which could itself be influenced by the Brexit vote - could also affect the FN\u2019s appeal.\n\nLe Pen has said that, if elected, she would launch negotiations to leave the euro, restore borders, ensure the primacy of French law over EU law, and scrap EU checks on French public finances.\n\nAfter six months, voters would decide in a referendum whether to stay in the bloc or leave.\n\nEven within the FN, there has been criticism of this policy, which has put off the elderly - who tend to vote more than younger voters - for fear their pension could be affected.\n\nBut opinion polls since the Brexit vote show a change among FN voters, with a huge majority now backing an EU exit.",
