    "text": "High profile withdrawals and resignations among Brexiteers in the wake of the EU referendum vote show that Britain\u2019s \u201cretro-nationalists\u201d are running away from the situation they created, according to European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker.\n\nJuncker told the European Parliament in Strasbourg on Tuesday that \u201cthe Brexit heroes of yesterday are now the sad Brexit heroes of today.\u201d\n\nBranding leading Brexiteers \u201cretro-nationalists,\u201d Juncker said: \u201cPatriots don\u2019t resign when things get difficult, they stay.\u201d\n\n\u201cInstead of developing the plan, they are leaving the boat,\u201d he added.\n\nThe \u2018sinking ship\u2019 analogy has become a popular trope to describe the Brexit. Hollywood actor Christopher Waltz used it in a Sky News interview on Monday, describing UKIP\u2019s Nigel Farage as a rat.\n\nFormer Belgian PM turned MEP Guy Verhofstadt told the European Parliament on Monday: \u201cBrexiteers remind me of rats leaving the sinking ship.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you waiting for \u2013 the next referendum in France, in Italy maybe,\u201d he raged.\n\nThe criticism centers on Leave campaigner and Tory MP Boris Johnson, who caused a furor by pulling out of the Tory leadership race on Thursday.\n\nArch-Brexiteer Nigel Farage, who resigned as UKIP leader on Monday, said he had never been a career politician and that he now wanted to have time to himself.\n\nIt emerged on Tuesday afternoon that the MEP will now be filling Katie Hopkins\u2019 slot on Sunday mornings on LBC radio.",
