Morrisons shares dropped 6.6 per cent to 174p before falling even further by 6.94 to 172.70p by the end of the afternoon.\n\nSainsbury\u2019s was down 3.6 per cent at 215p at 2pm before recovering to 215.90p.\n\nThe sharp fall followed a note from David McCarthy, HSBC analyst, suggesting Asda will dramatically cut its prices this summer.\n\nHSBC noted that David Cheesewright, the chief executive of Walmart, the US owner of Asda, recently told shareholders that the UK supermarket chain will prioritise sales over margin.\n\n\u201cIf Asda does reposition fundamentally, then it could seriously damage sector profitability,\u201d McCarthy said.\n\n\u201cIf Asda decided to invest half its margin into price, a competitor reaction could wipe out almost all industry profitability and would force an industry restructure,\u201d he added.\n\nHSBC, reflecting the increased risk and uncertainty, downgraded Tesco to a \u201chold\u201d rating from \u201cbuy\u201d, and cut Morrisons to \u201creduce\u201d from \u201chold\u201d, but kept Sainsbury's at \u201creduce\u201d.",
