    "text": "BRITAIN will soon boast the lowest corporation tax rate of any major economy, after chancellor George Osborne revealed plans to slash the rate from 20% to less than 15%.\n\nIn an interview with the Financial Times, the chancellor said the cuts were part of a plan to galvanise the economy and woo businesses that may be unsure of their British allegiances following Brexit.\n\n\u2018Super competitive economy\u2019\n\nThe move would see Britain possess a corporation tax rate just 2.5% higher than Ireland\u2019s, where a number of multinational corporations, including Facebook and Google, base their European operations.\n\nIn his first interview since 52% of the referendum voted to leave the EU, Osborne stated that he wanted to create a \u201csuper competitive economy\u201d through low taxes and by attracting further global investment, particularly from China.\n\n\u201cWe must focus on the horizon and the journey ahead and make the most of the hand we\u2019ve been dealt,\u201d said Osborne, whose new five-point plan to stimulate the economy includes furthering Chinese investment; guaranteeing support for bank lending; an increase in efforts to invest in the Northern powerhouse; and maintaining the UK\u2019s fiscal credibility.\n\nOsborne also urged the Bank of England to use its powers to avoid \u201ca contraction of credit in the economy\u201d.\n\nIn the last Budget, Osborne announced that corporation tax would be reduced to 17% by 2020, but the plans to reduce the tax even further has prompted worrying calls from the OECD.\n\nUK a tax haven?\n\n\u201cThe negative impact of the Brexit on UK competitiveness may push the UK to be even more aggressive in its tax offer,\u201d said Pascal Saint-Amans, the OECD\u2019s head of tax in an internal memo that was brought to light by Reuters.\n\n\u201cA further step in that direction would really turn the UK into a tax haven type of economy,\u201d he added.\n\nIn January, French MEP Eva Joly told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that the UK is \u201cpreparing itself to become a tax haven\u201d for multinationals, in a reaction to Google\u2019s \u00a3130m agreement with HMRC over unpaid back taxes.\n\nShare",
