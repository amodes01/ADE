    "text": "(CBS) -- Britain's decision leave the EU may be leaving the Brits in a precarious position, but it is good news for Americans headed to the UK.\n\nCBS2's Dorothy Tucker takes a look at what a stronger dollar means to your pocket book.\n\nLarry Bachman is headed to France, but when the news broke that Britain voted to pull out of the EU he thought about changing his plans.\n\n\"The pound had fallen 30 percent at that point,\" he says.\n\nCalls to travel agencies across the city are up after news about Britain. But agents say the biggest benefactors are those who have already booked.\n\nLast week, a British pound would cost you a $1.46; today, it's 13 cents less -- $1.33.\n\nSo, if you already booked a hotel for 263 pounds a night, last week it would have cost you $384. Today, it's $350 -- saving you $34.\n\nYou'll also save if you book your flight today. According to airfarewatchdog.com, you can get round trip from Chicago to London in September on a few airlines for $570. That's about half the price of previous years.\n\nSince no one can predict the value of dollar the end of the summer, the advice is to book now.",
