    "text": "As America celebrates its 240th anniversary of independence from Britain, Texas\u2019 and California\u2019s campaigns to secede from the US have been given a kiss of life. But are they really ready to follow #Brexit and revive their bids to break away from Washington.\n\n#Texit #Texodus\n\nRight after the Brexit success, people in Texas began pushing for a \u2018Texit\u2019\u2013 a Texas split from the USA \u2013 on social media.\n\nTo explain why Texas should secede from the Union, Twitter users showed the map of EU and outlined the area of the Lone Star State. And it looks rather impressive.\n\nOthers even suggested a better hashtag for a Texas exit: #Texodus, a portmanteau of \u2018Texas\u2019 plus \u2018exodus\u2019, the migration of Jews from Egypt.\n\nTexas was the 28th state to join the Union in 1845, following nine years as an independent republic. According to speculation from the Texas Nationalist Movement, the state could exit the US as early as 2018.\n\n\u201cIn the Brexit vote, the people of UK felt that they were paying more into EU than were getting out of it. And it\u2019s exactly as it is here in Texas,\u201d Daniel Miller, President of the TNM, told RT.\n\nAccording to Miller, there is a sense locally that the best people to govern Texas are Texans.\n\nREAD MORE: From Brexit to Texit: Texas secession movement targets 2018 ballot\n\nBoasting 261,231 supporters on its website, TNM is calling for more Texans to join and bring pressure on Texas Governor Greg Abbott to allow a vote on independence from the US and its \u201csprawling Federal bureaucracy.\u201d\n\nAnd based on its present day $1.6 trillion economy, if it did become a separate nation, it would be among the 10 top economies in the world, Miller said.\n\nThe group has more likes on Facebook than the Texas Democratic Party, one of the two major political parties in Texas, with 211,000 \u2018likes\u2019 compared to 133,000.\n\n#Calexit #Caleavefornia\n\nAnd Texas is not alone when it comes to following the Brexit example \u2013 some in California, the most populous US state, are ready to split, too.\n\nMaybe a Calexit might not be a bad idea. 6th largest economy in world & an engine for economic growth. California as a sovereign republic. \u2014 Shervin Pishevar (@shervin) June 24, 2016\n\nThe \u2018Yes, California\u2019 Twitter community, which leads the campaign for the Golden State to secede from the United States, already compared the size of California to the EU.\n\n\u201cWe are here in California subsidizing the other states of this union,\u201d Louis J. Marinelli, president of the Yes, California independence campaign, told RT. \u201cAs a result we are losing tens, sometimes hundreds of billions of dollars every year\u201d to other states.\n\nThus, Californians don\u2019t have enough to improve healthcare or education, he added.\n\n\u201cWe did an informal poll. We asked 9,000 Californians: \u2018Should California become an independent country?\u2019 And our response at that time was 41 percent said \u2018Yes\u2019. That\u2019s why we take so much encouragement after what happened in the Brexit vote,\u201d he added.\n\nSome 7,000 users \u2018like\u2019 Yes California on Facebook. The group is organizing a California Independence Rally on the 166th Anniversary of Californian \u2018Statehood\u2019 September 9.\n\nCalifornia officially joined US back in 1850, becoming its 31st state.\n\nREAD MORE: Brexit changes nothing\n\nYet California and Texas are not the only US states eager to exit the union.\n\nREAD MORE: Washington fears Brexit will unravel its anti-Russia policy\n\nNative Americans, who have long struggled for independence status in the US, proposed their own Republic of Lakotah back in 2007. It is, in fact, a virtual state which covers some 200,000 sq km and includes territories of North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Wyoming and Montana.\n\nIn the meantime, the Alaskan Independence Party (AIP) has been calling to quit the US since 1980s. There is also the so-called Cascadian movement in the US and Canada, which calls to form a country consisting of Washington, Oregon and portions of other US states, as well as British Columbia, Canada.\n\nHawaii, the most recent state of the US, which received statehood back in 1959, has also had its own independence movements since the 1960s. One of them, the Hawaiian sovereignty movement, says that the archipelago\u2019s annexation was illegal.\n\nHowever, according to Eugene Volokh, a law professor at University of California, the exit of states from the US, and Texit in particular, won\u2019t happen.\n\n\u201cA state couldn\u2019t legally force the US to let it secede, if the US refused. But if the state and the US agreed, that would be doable. At worst, it would require a constitutional amendment, but most likely an act of Congress, coupled with a majority referendum that the state government views as binding, would suffice,\u201d Volokh told the Dallas Observer\n\nHe added that \u201cmost Texans \u2026.are proud to be Americans, whether or not they like what the federal government is doing, and they can see the benefits of remaining part of a powerful country that can defend their interests.\u201d",
