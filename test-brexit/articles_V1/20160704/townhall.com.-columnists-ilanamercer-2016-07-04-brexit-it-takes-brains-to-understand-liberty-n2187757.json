    "text": "During the Bretton Woods Conference, in 1944, Lord Halifax is said to have \u201cwhispered to Lord Keynes: \u2018It\u2019s true: they have the money bags but we have all the brains.\u2019\u201d By \u201cthey,\u201d Halifax meant the Americans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHis frustration with the American mind\u2014often prosaic and anti-intellectual\u2014during the critical Bretton-Woods negotiations seems as valid today. As odious as Britain\u2019s elites are; boy, are they cleverer than ours. Take the impromptu interview, on June 28, which Richard Quest, CNN\u2019s imported British broadcast journalist, conducted with Nigel Farage, leader of the UK Independence Party.\n\nFarage had emerged exhilarated from the coven that is the European Parliament, where he had shared some home truths with the ponces leeching off Britain.\n\nOther than to mouth formulaically about \u201csmall government, big military, balanced budgets and the penny plan\u201d\u2014America\u2019s chattering class and ruling elites seem incapable of expressing the principles undergirding freedom. And members of this political Idiocracy dissolve into a puddle if their cue cards disappear.\n\nFarage, however, spoke to some difficult ideas with ease, and without notes.\n\nThe act of secession, the quests for sovereignty, decentralization and regional autonomy from a second tier of tyrants\u2014the first being the national, British government\u2014involve comprehending complicated ideas.\n\nAbout this, Milton Friedman forewarned in the introduction to F.A. Hayek's \"The Road to Serfdom.\" Whereas \u201cthe argument for collectivism is simple if false; it is an immediate emotional argument.\u201d \u201cThe argument for individualism\u201d and freedom, on the other hand, \u201cis subtle and sophisticated; it is an indirect rational argument.\"\n\nPut differently: It\u2019s difficult for dummies to understand liberty, let alone defend it, a problem the scintillating, cerebral Mr. Farage doesn\u2019t have.\n\n\u201cYou as a political project are in denial,\u201d he told the grumbling laggards in the EU chamber. The EU had, \u201cby stealth by deception, and without ever telling the truth to the British and European people, imposed political union upon them.\u201d\n\nHeckling Eurocrats were reminded by Farage that when, in 2005, the people of the Netherlands and France said adieu to an enforced political union\u2014the Eurocrats had \u201cignored them and brought in the Lisbon Treaty through the backdoor.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the last refuge of a Brussels scoundrel is the bureaucracy. When voters scuttled the EU Constitution in that referenda; the rogues being upbraided by Farage simply dissolved one illegitimate political structure and constituted another.\n\n\u201cWhat the little people did,\u201d continued Farage; \u201cwhat the ordinary people did, what the people who\u2019ve been oppressed have done is to reject the multinationals, reject the merchant banks, reject Big Politics, and demand their country back, their fishing waters back, their borders back. We want to be an independent self-governing nation.\u201d\n\nA series of similar watersheds would follow, predicted Farage.\n\nFleetingly, at least, Farage\u2019s fluency with the ideas of freedom took effect. The blank faces flanking UKIP\u2019s leader looked somewhat animated. Fewer jeered; some even clapped and cheered as Farage went on to submit that no stalling would be tolerated. The will of the British people would be heeded forthwith. Called for was \u201ca grown-up and sensible attitude\u201d toward executing popular\u2014in this case, naturally licit\u2014wishes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr. Farage was not done, going on to impress upon EU parliamentarians\u2014none of whom had \u201cheld a proper job\u201d in their lives, \u201cor worked in business or worked in trade, or indeed ever created a job in [their] lives\u201d\u2014that unlike a coerced political union, trade in goods was mutually beneficial and voluntary and would continue.\n\nHere the booing resumed.\n\nIf, in sensing an opportunity to exert unauthorized political power, this unelected mob intended to reject trade between Europe and England, reinstate tariffs and quotas\u2014Mr. Farage was pleased to inform them the consequences to Europe would be worse.\n\nNo doubt: As statist and regulated as the once great merchant and maritime nation of Britain has become\u2014Europe under the Brussels machinery is practically paralyzed.\n\nFew in U.S. media appreciate that language that effectively conveys clear ideas has got to be strong. Weasel words won\u2019t do. Thus Ashley Banfield was flabbergasted by Farage\u2019s verbal whips. CNN\u2019s verbose host was appalled, you guessed, at the \u201ctone\u201d taken by Farage in his pointed remarks to the EU.\n\nDays prior, two lunatic American women, dressed in matching Mao-like tunics, had stormed a stage together, where they had a petit mal fit over Donald Trump. Yet the two\u2014Hillary Clinton and \u201cPocahontas,\u201d aka Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts\u2014made reporters like Banfield giddy with Girl Power.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNever was Warren depicted as angry or out-of-control. Instead, she was a \u201ctowering\u201d liberal Democrat, who delivered not ad hominem but \u201cenergy, folksy appeal and a populist roar ...\u201d\n\nBy contrast, Quest, Banfield\u2019s British-born colleague, was able to settle down to a blind panic by the time he conducted his exhilarating interview with Mr. Farage.\n\nNo longer in a post-Brexit frothy, Quest even accepted Farage\u2019s forceful instruction to \u201cstop this nonsense about the markets. The pound has been in a bear market since July 2014. Fact!\u201d Jittery markets had begun to self-correct, the Dow was bouncing back.\n\nUnlike their hysterical colleagues in the US, British liberal journalists have even begun to pull back slightly in embarrassment. Were they really going to persist in lamenting losses suffered by global puppet-master George Soros and the financial sector, all just to take aim at the Little People? In so doing, was not the Left showing it loved the lumpenproletariat only as long as they got with The Left's program?\n\nMoreover, Quest\u2019s professional counterparts in Britain (indubitably the smarter cohort) seem to have backed off of accusing 17.5 million \u201cLeave\u201d voters of being old, uneducated, racist, and generally obsolete right-wing extremists. In other words, Trump voters. The liberal brain trust stateside has yet to grant this courtesy to Tea Party pioneers, much less to Trump voters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor his part, Quest showed the same intellectual agility as his opponent: \u201cSo, how on earth do you have the effrontery to criticize Wall Street, the banks, you criticize a big business when you were part of those markets?\u201d\n\nImage and American politician attempting to respond to such a question with a First-Principles answer!\n\nFarage did. He stumped Quest by explaining that markets aren't the creatures of big business. \u201cGood markets have small and medium size competitors trading in them too.\u201d He then pivoted to the crony actions of the free-market flouting Goldman Sachs. \u201cIn cahoots with this European commission,\u201d such bad-faith actors did much mischief: Usher \u201cGreece into the Euro,\u201d for example.\n\nOrdinary people are slowly coming to realize that adding a second tier of tyrants\u2014EU, NAFTA, UN, NATO, WTO\u2014to their own tyrannical national governments has benefited them as a second hangman enhances the health of a condemned man.\n\nSo when Quest resumed his nervy narrative about the \u201cterrible message\u201d being sent \u201cabout what's happening in Britain,\u201d their representative shot back:\n\n\"Taking back 'our country, our laws, our courts, our borders, our pride and self-respect is a great message. Our political class has let us down like a cheap pair of braces and what we did last week in that referendum was say, \u2018Get thee gone.\u2019\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNigel Farage\u2019s repartee is in a class of its own. Observing its brilliance accentuates the absence of a similar facility among our own mainstream clodhopper commentariat. The verbal swordplay initiated by Farage, leader of the UKIP, often gets lost in translation, stateside.\n\nThe dumbed-down transcript, provided by CNN, had turned Farage's \u201cget thee gone\u201d into \u201cget the gun.\u201d",
