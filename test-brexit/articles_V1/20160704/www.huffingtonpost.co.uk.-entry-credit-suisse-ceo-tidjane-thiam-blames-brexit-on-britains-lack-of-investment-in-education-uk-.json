    "text": "The chief executive of Credit Suisse has laid the blame for the Brexit vote at the feet of Britain\u2019s \u201cchronic lack of investment in education\u201d.\n\nTidjane Thiam was remarking on the country\u2019s decision to leave the European Union as voted for by a majority of 52%, during a business conference in France.\n\nThiam also said he was shocked at the high levels of inequality in the country, particularly after visiting a school in Tower Hamlets, where he was told around half the pupils only ate once a day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCEO Tidjane Thiam of Swiss bank Credit Suisse Arnd Wiegmann / Reuters\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s something I had seen in the Ivory Coast,\" Thiam, who is a former government minister in the West African country, told Reuters.\n\nThe banker believes the solution lies in a more redistributive tax system \u2013 even if that meant raising taxes \u2013 to ensure those who have lost out to globalization are not left feeling disenfranchised.\n\nThiam, who took over the bank last summer, says he watched and backed the anti-Brexit march in London on Saturday, but added: \u201cI would have liked to say to them: \u2018how many more of you would accept to pay more taxes?\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all well and good to have big signs and protest against the \u2018Leave\u2019 vote. But it would be another story if you started having a discussion about creating more solidarity.\u201d\n\nHe added that those with the lowest levels of education were most likely to back Brexit, summing up: \u201cThat\u2019s the price paid for a chronic lack of investment in education.\n\n\u201cSomething must be done at the national level so there aren\u2019t so many people left behind that the result of a national, democratic vote gives a result which is bad for the country in the medium term.\"\n\nYears of austerity coupled with mass immigration have kindled resentment, particularly among the white working class, against elites in London - and by extension the EU's headquarters in Brussels seen as responsible for an influx of Europeans to Britain.\n\nDespite a growing income gap, a Credit Suisse report found that the number of million-dollar-wealth households rose 30 percent between 2013 and 2014 alone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe outcome was also a sombre reminder that the capital, where votes were strongly skewed toward remain, is at odds with much of the rest of the country.\n\nThe city's economy, strongly linked to international trade and banking, is now expected to take a hit as markets face years of uncertainty over Britain's ties with Europe.\n\nIn February Thiam proposed that its board make a \u201csignificant\u201d cut to his bonus after the Swiss bank posted disappointing earnings and announced 4,000 job cuts.",
