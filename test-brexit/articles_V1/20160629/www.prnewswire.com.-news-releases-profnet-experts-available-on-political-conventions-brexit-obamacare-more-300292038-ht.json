Brexit was the nearly inevitable result of failed political leadership, failed in the sense of making the case -- and the case exists -- that EU membership benefits the UK beyond financial elites in the city of London.\"\n\nBhala can discuss Brexit, the UK voting to leave the EU, economic ramifications for all concerned nations, as well as the effects on American markets. He is the author of \"Modern GATT Law,\" \"International Trade Law: An Interdisciplinary, Non-Western Textbook\" and dozens of journal articles on international trade law.\n\nContact: Mike Krings, [email protected]\n\nPaul Ryan's Obamacare Replacement Announcement\n\nKosali Simon, Ph.D.\n\nProfessor, Health Economist\n\nIndiana University, School of Public and Environmental Affairs\n\n\"Most would agree special interests had influence over shaping of the ACA, and that lobbying continues; however, it's likely that any replacement plan would face similar political realities. What makes me wonder is what political experts would think of the chance that a replacement plan would be immune to such criticism.\"\n\nBio: https://spea.indiana.edu/faculty-research/directory/profiles/faculty/full-time/simon-kosali.html\n\nWebsite: https://www.iu.edu\n\nContact: Agata Porter, [email protected]\n\nTurkish-Israeli Reconciliation Deal\n\nHoward Eissenstat\n\nAssociate Professor of History\n\nSt. Lawrence University\n\n\"Regarding the Turkish-Israeli reconciliation deal on June 27: Both Turkey and Israel benefit from the deal. Both have desire to limit regional isolation. For Turkey, this has been particularly acute. The agreement was a bitter pill for Erdogan, who feels strong personal sympathy for Palestinians. The failure to lift Gaza blockade significant. The deal points to fact that Erdogan, who is often framed as an ideologue, is capable of realism. It also points to his absolute control over local press, which is framing the deal as a Turkish victory.\"\n\nEissenstat is an expert in Turkish affairs. He speaks regularly to government officials, the press, and community groups regarding issues related to Turkey and the Middle East. He has also served as a country specialist on Turkey for Amnesty International-USA since 2006.

Lacy\n\nDirector, Robert J. Dole Institute of Politics\n\nUniversity of Kansas\n\n\"This is shaping up as the most unique presidential election of my lifetime. I have seen them as a high-level advisor and as an observer, and this one is crazy and completely unpredictable.\"\n\nLacy has been director of the Dole Institute for Politics since 2004 and has played a major role in seven presidential campaigns, including senior roles in Bob Dole's 1988 and 1996 campaigns, Ronald Reagan's 1980 and 1984 bids, and George H.W. Bush's 1988 and 1992 campaigns. He was also President Reagan's White House political director. In 2007m he took a leave of absence from the Institute to manage the presidential campaign of former Sen. Fred Thompson (R-Tenn). During his tenure as director, Lacy has established the Dole Institute as a highly respected venue for bipartisan, philosophically balanced political programming. He can discuss the upcoming conventions, the nomination process, the possibility of brokered conventions, the importance of the conventions and the general election following both parties' conventions.\n\nContact: Mike Krings, [email protected]\n\nRobert Boatright\n\nProfessor, Political Science\n\nClark University (Massachusetts)\n\n\"Regarding the conventions, I'll be looking at whether Republican elites -- donors, leaders of Super PACs, etc. -- find a compelling reason to stick with Trump. My expectation is that if Trump is still down in the polls once the conventions have concluded, most in the party will cut him loose and focus on minimizing party losses in the House and Senate. Things like this have happened before, but they've never happened as suddenly as was the case this year.\"\n\nBoatright studies political interest groups, campaign finance, American political behavior, political participation and political theory.\n\nWebsite: http://www.clarku.edu\n\nContact: Jane Salerno, [email protected]\n\nSeth Masket\n\nAssociate Professor and Chair of Political Science\n\nUniversity of Denver\n\n\"Modern party conventions have become pretty straightforward events that just ratify decisions that party voters made months earlier. This year could be different, particularly on the Republican side. There's a significant chance we'll see some delegates rebel against the party's presumptive nominee and attempt to choose someone else. We could see some real drama on the floor in Cleveland.\"\n\nMasket is the author of \"The Inevitable Party: Why Attempts to Kill the Party System Fail and How They Weaken Democracy\" (Oxford University Press, 2016). A frequent writer and commentator, he can talk about American politics, political parties, campaigns and elections, polarization, social networks and political reform movements.\n\nWebsite: http://www.du.edu/ahss/polisci/facultystaff/masket_seth.html\n\nContact: Laura Snyder, [email protected]\n\nPatrick Miller\n\nAssistant Professor of Political Science\n\nUniversity of Kansas\n\n\"What is the consequence of today's polarized politics? What's motivating partisans to vote in this climate? For too many of them, it's not high-minded, good-government, issue-based goals. It's, 'I hate the other party. I'm going to go out, and we're going to beat them.' That's troubling.\"\n\nMiller monitors national polling related to the presidential campaign that is made available and tweets analysis at Twitter.com/pmiller1693. His broad research interests include national politics and attitudes of partisanship. He is available to discuss political conventions, political partisanship, polling and elections.\n\nContact: George Diepenbrock, [email protected]\n\nMichael V. Haselswerdt, Ph.D.\n\nProfessor of Political Science\n\nCanisius College\n\n\"Those in the national parties usually want their presidential candidates to win, but knowing that a sitting president defines the party, this may not be as true for significant portions of both parties this year.\"\n\nDr. Haselswerdt has more than four decades of experience in political science. He teaches courses in American political behavior, the U.S. Congress and research methods. He has been involved in several local political campaigns and is frequently asked by the media to comment on local, state and national issues. Dr. Haselswerdt teaches a popular course on Presidential Campaign Advance every four years and, as a result, several former students have worked on presidential campaigns. He served on the campaign staff for Michael Dukakis staff at the 1988 convention in Atlanta. He can speak to the different interests of the candidates and the national party at these gatherings, as well as to interests that are congruent. He would also be able to discuss the history of conventions and the chances of a contested convention.\n\nBio: http://www.canisius.edu/person/michael-v-haselswerdt-phd\n\nContact: Kristin Etu, [email protected]\n\nVincent Hutchings\n\nProfessor of Political Science\n\nUniversity of Michigan\n\nHutchings says the conventions now seek to galvanize the party base: \"It's not like it was several decades ago where the conventions helped to decide who the nominees would be -- so it's not going to be as influential as it could be. But it will still be important, because now conventions mostly serve the role to help generate support and enthusiasm for the nominee.\"\n\nBio: https://www.isr.umich.edu/cps/people_faculty_vincenth.html\n\nContact: Jared Wadley, [email protected]\n\nCarrie Keating\n\nProfessor of Psychology\n\nColgate University\n\nKeating studies the power of gestures and is available to discuss their impact within the context of political conventions: \"Politicians are mindful of how they say something. I don't think you can get to the top level, the top rung in politics anymore, without being a pretty fair actor.\"\n\nBio: http://www.colgate.edu/facultysearch/facultydirectory/ckeating\n\nVideo: http://tinyurl.com/zd9zssh\n\nContact: Daniel DeVries, [email protected]\n\nJack Hunter\n\nEditor\n\nRare Politics\n\nHunter is a former adviser to Ron Paul's presidential campaign, and co-author of \"The Tea Party Goes to Washington\" by Sen.
