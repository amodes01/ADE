I think that would be a mistake. But there are a number of ways.\u201d\n\nMr Kerry\u2019s suggestion that Brexit might not happen comes after demonstrations in the UK against Britain leaving the EU and after thousands signed petitions for a second referendum.\n\nUK constitutional lawyers have also said that MPs still had the legal right to vote down any move to trigger Brexit, with Geoffrey Robertson QC telling The Independent the referendum had been \u201cpurely advisory\u201d.\n\nEU Commission President Jean Claude Juncker, however, has made clear his view that \u201cit is not an amicable divorce\u201d and Britain should start negotiating exit terms immediately\n\nThe Obama Administration has long been clear in its opposition to Brexit. In April, while visiting the UK, Barack Obama said Britain would be at the \u201cback of the queue\u201d in any trade deal with the US if it left the EU.\n\nHowever, on Tuesday Mr Obama sought to calm diplomatic and financial market fears about Brexit by telling American National Public Radio: \u201cI would not overstate it. There's been a little bit of hysteria post-Brexit vote, as if somehow Nato\u2019s gone, the trans-Atlantic alliance is dissolving, and every country is rushing off to its own corner. That's not what's happening.\n\n\u201cI think the best way to think about this is that a pause button has been pressed on the project of full European integration.\u201d",
