    "text": "Thursday\u2019s vote in the United Kingdom suggested Brexit was a referendum on the global elite; a rebuke of cosmopolitanism, globalization, and the postwar order. London, an island of strong \u201cRemain\u201d support, was marooned in a sea of \u201cLeave.\u201d Dispatches from the British hinterland confirmed the impression of Capital against Country. \u201cIn shorthand,\u201d Peter Mandler wrote in Dissent, \u201cBritain\u2019s EU problem is a London problem.\u201d\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the vote, it certainly seemed that wealthy London\u2014a city of students, immigrants, and tourists, corporate headquarters, and creative industries doing business abroad, all thriving under the status quo\u2014had been castigated by Britain. There was talk of banks relocating from the city to Dublin, Frankfurt, and Paris; anti-immigrant graffiti and attacks; and Londoners renouncing their country. As the U.K. voted to exit the established international system, London\u2019s position as the world\u2019s pre-eminent global city was diminished. The question was not whether London would suffer the consequences of Brexit, but how much it would suffer.\n\nEasy to forget, amidst all this: Brexit\u2019s most famous advocate, Boris Johnson, is the bicycle-commuting, subway-riding former mayor of London, who claimed that a well-managed Brexit was the best possible solution for the city itself. \u201cIf you want our great capital to be genuinely open to the world\u2014rather than locked in and diminished by a failing EU system,\u201d he wrote in the Evening Standard before the vote, \u201cthen go global, vote Leave, and take back control next week.\u201d Brexit as vote may have been an expression of anti-London sentiment, but Brexit as policy hasn\u2019t always been conceived that way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJohnson and co. have long argued that London, the global metropolis, had more to lose from the bureaucratic tyranny of the European Union than from a well-managed departure. In a 2014 Greater London Authority report titled \u201cA Win-Win Situation,\u201d Gerard Lyons, Johnson\u2019s chief economic adviser and a full-fledged Brexiteer, concluded that an outward-looking Brexit was a far superior option for London than \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d in the EU and would enhance the city\u2019s competitive advantage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cLondon is considerably more oriented towards both innovation and the world economy than is the rest of the U.K.,\u201d the report says. An exit accompanied by pro-growth policies, according to this theory, would actually cause London\u2019s growth rate to leap even further ahead of the U.K. at large.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn this scenario, Brexit would not, as Manhattan Institute fellow Aaron Renn writes, refute \u201cthe urban triumphalist vision\u201d in which \u201ccities, not provinces or nation-states, are the real actors in the global economy.\u201d On the contrary, London\u2019s Brexit lobby imagined the city\u2019s influence growing. Regulatory freedom, high-skilled immigration, a union of British cities pushing for greater local power: Those were the ingredients for a post-Brexit London, a freewheeling global city-state. (Even London Mayor Sadiq Khan, a Remainer, reacted to the Brexit vote with that hope. \u201cOn behalf of all Londoners,\u201d he told business leaders on Tuesday, \u201cI am demanding more autonomy for the capital\u2014right now.\u201d)\n\nGreg Clark, a senior fellow at Brookings\u2019 Metropolitan Policy Program, takes a similarly sunny view of Brexit. If London adapts quickly, he predicts, \u201ccorporations will reorganize rather than leave,\u201d especially with a national immigration policy better-suited for London\u2019s needs than the EU\u2019s worker freedom requirements. \u201cLondon will present a diversification opportunity for investors,\u201d he continues, and could gain more independence relative to the U.K. state. (The Economist derisively calls this rosy view the \u201cSingapore on steroids\u201d idea. Rather than imitate the success of the tiny polity that has become a global financial center in just 50 years, the magazine suggests that a solitary Britain would end up \u201cpoorer, less open and less innovative \u2026 less influential and more parochial.\u201d)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat happens to universities after Brexit offers a good example of what cosmopolitan London prospering from EU remove might look like. Broadly speaking, as I wrote on Friday, higher education has been considered one of the EU\u2019s greatest success stories. The Erasmus program has allowed millions of young Europeans to study abroad and created a whole generation of (highly educated) Europeans with friends and memories across national borders. London, meanwhile, is one of the world capitals of international education. At London colleges and universities, 1 in 4 students are from outside the U.K. Under EU rules, students from the European Union are eligible for discounted tuition fees and a related student loan scheme that makes a British education much more affordable for them than for other international students, who might pay more than twice as much. At University College London, the 4,500 EU students make up the fastest-growing group in the student body. (About 1 in 5 UCL staff members are also EU nationals.) Brexit could jeopardize those connections.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut it\u2019s China that is the fastest-growing source of students at London universities more generally, and it\u2019s there (and to India, Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Africa) that Britain could look. Students and professors, wrote Jamie Martin, a former U.K. Department of Education official, \u201cshould vote for a more open, innovative and internationalist future\u2014and that means voting to Leave.\u201d More students from India, mainland China, the USA, Hong Kong, and Nigeria (paying more than their EU counterparts) would also constitute a \u201cwindfall\u201d for the schools.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat vision represents, in microcosm, the post-Brexit London utopia, a city oriented less toward Europe and more toward the world at large.\n\nIt is also, as many, many observers have noted, a mirage. The dream of a London-friendly Brexit depends foremost on getting a sweetheart deal with the European Union on issues like \u201cpassporting,\u201d the rules that allow EU financial institutions to be based in London, and most critics don\u2019t think the U.K. has the leverage to obtain a superior agreement. (Or as an EU diplomat put it on Monday, \u201cYou cannot have your cake and eat it.\u201d)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere\u2019s also the question of internal politics. As Anne Applebaum writes in the Washington Post, \u201cThat elite version of Brexit\u2014England as an offshore haven, a deregulated zone, an arcadian haven, a cosmopolitan business center, the Dubai of the North Atlantic\u2014was not what the Daily Mail and the Daily Telegraph sold in the campaign, and it isn\u2019t what the leave campaign put on their billboards.\u201d\n\nThe Leave campaign became increasingly tainted by xenophobia, while immigration remains the essential ingredient of London\u2019s success. The city is now 38 percent foreign-born, up from 15 percent in 1971. Last year, London surpassed its all-time population mark, set in 1939. But the native-born population is actually lower than it was in 1971\u2014by a full million people.\n\nNo one knows who will be negotiating Brexit (apparently one thing the Brexit-for-London planners forgot was to have a plan). But if the Brexit vote is a product of economic frustration with the capital, it seems na\u00efve to think the resulting series of deals will be crafted to London\u2019s liking.\n\nRead more from Slate on the Brexit vote.",
