    "text": "It's extremely difficult to believe that any one could seriously credit this contention that Brexit, the process of Britain leaving the European Union, could lead to the UK not being able to feed itself. The entirely mindboggling argument is that Britain currently imports much of its food from the European Union. This is true of course. The brain warping part that follows is that because Britain leaves the European Union it will no longer be able to import food from the European Union.\n\nWhat?\n\nI'm sorry but what? The detritus from what bong habit caused this mental spasm? What appalling misunderstanding of trade has led to the thought (thought? Pah!) that because we might not want to share a government with them any more, them across the Channel, they will therefore refuse to sell us stuff? Which -ish has caused this gibber?\n\nOf course, there are corners of the internet where they will believe anything at all, even that The Donald and Hillary are the two best possible candidates out of 320 million people. But this food and Brexit idea has turned up somewhere generally thought to be respectable - the New Yorker no less. Perhaps if they spent a little less time thinking about the placement of commas and a little more about basic logic things would improve. But here it is:\n\nIn April, Lang co-authored\u2014with Victoria Schoen\u2014a \u201cbriefing paper\u201d on the far-reaching impact of Brexit on British food. It is a sobering read. Lang and Schoen point out that, as of 2015, twenty-seven per cent of all food eaten in the U.K. (by value) was imported from the E.U. (compared with just four per cent from North America and four per cent from Africa). When it comes to fruits and vegetables, Britain is dependent on the E.U. for forty per cent of fresh produce. Lang sees this as a question of health as much as economics. Only thirty per cent of British adults currently eat the recommended five daily portions of fruits and vegetables, and only a tiny fraction of U.K. farmland is given over to horticulture\u2014a hundred and sixty-four thousand hectares, out of 4.7 million hectares of crop-growing land. When the E.U. subsidies and tariff exemptions are gone, the odds are that plant foods will become more expensive, and that even fewer Brits will consume enough of them.\n\nThat paper is here:\n\nThe UK is heavily dependent on other EU member states for food. UK food production is below 60% of\n\nconsumption and particularly reliant on imports for fruit and many vegetables. Supporters of Brexit\n\nhave not once addressed the UK\u2019s dependency on EU producers and suppliers. The UK suffers a huge food trade gap of \u00a321bn. Not only is the UK reliant on the rest of Europe for\n\nfood but this imbalance is a drain on the national balance of payments.\n\nYes, we buy lots of food from Europe. Doing so is a drain on the balance of payments (actually, no it isn't, as the balance always balances it's an increase in the trade deficit though) and so dang what? Absolutely none of that dependency upon other EU nations is of Britons being reliant upon the kindness of foreign governments to be able to eat. It's reliant upon people being willing to sell us, for a profit, what we'd like to eat. In this Britain and Britons are in the same position as the 95% of the people in any advanced society who do something other than farm for a living. And who on Earth thinks that in or out of the EU Joachim, Jacques, Joao or Jorgen are going to be unwilling to send us some calories for a bit of folding stuff? It's a monstrously absurd assumption.\n\nIn more detail:\n\nFrom a public health perspective, Brexit raises both challenges and opportunities.\n\nThe challenge would be to put in place a Plan B for quick implementation. The UK is\n\nnot self-sufficient. Supplies would be disrupted. The public is used to full\n\nsupermarket shelves. The pound sterling is widely expected to drop, so imports\n\nwould be more expensive, and reliance on world markets could raise prices, but\n\ncould also incentive new sources at home and abroad. One key sensitivity would be\n\nfruit and vegetables. The UK is 40% reliant on EU imports for fruit and vegetables.\n\nThe population ought to be eating far more horticultural produce, but even at\n\ncurrent consumption levels, the capacity for disruption would be considerable for\n\nboth UK and EU. Defra ought to consider this a priority for its Plan B.\n\nWhat disruption? Someone's not going to sell Sainsbury's a truck or two of potatoes because Britain has left the EU? Seriously, this entire concept is drivel.\n\nAnd I'm sorry but it gets worse than this. Yes, really, worse:\n\nLike all affluent societies, the UK has experienced a slow but dramatic change in\n\nfood prices since World War 2. The average household expenditure on food has\n\ndropped from around 25% of disposable income to under 10% today (more if eating\n\nout is included). The 20% lowest income households spend proportionately more,\n\naround 16%.[117] In 2014, the Food Research Collaboration published an\n\nassessment of UK food prices. In that, we presented government data suggesting\n\nthat UK food prices were 14th equal in Europe, i.e. exactly in the mid-point of\n\ncheapness/expensiveness.[135] However, tariffs on imports if the UK was outside\n\nthe EU might affect this situation.\n\nFigure 6 gives the tariff rates that the Government suggests could be applied to UK\n\ngoods entering the EU in the event of a Brexit. These are significant compared with\n\nthe current zero tariff allowances.\n\nHere is Figure 6:\n\nNote this well. Those are the tariffs which Britain has to charge, while in the EU, on food coming from outside the EU. Food from inside the EU moves free of tariffs of course. Britain leaves the EU and thus does not have to charge those tariffs on non-EU food. And of course we don't have to charge tariffs on food from the EU either, this is all entirely up to us. And not charging tariffs on food imports into Britain is going to make food in Britain more expensive?\n\nDang, I want to find out what was in that bong, sounds like some really good stuff.\n\nIn their conclusion:\n\nAnd precisely how will the UK sever food ties with its main source of food\n\nimports?\n\nNo, really, they are assuming that if we're not in the EU then we will no longer buy EU food. Why on Earth anyone would believe something of such monstrous stupidity is beyond me to divine I'm afraid but there we have it. We're all going to starve because Martin Schulz is not our Parliamentary President any more.\n\nAnd now we return you to your regularly scheduled reality. Britain's food supply will, as it has done for a century and a half or so, be largely domestically based with some 40% or so being provided by foreigners who like the taste of our money. That we're inside or outside a particular method of European governance is going to make no difference to that at all. And the absence of that European governance system's external tariffs will all, most likely, make it cheaper to boot.\n\nFinally, an anecdote. All Brits will be familiar with the Oxo brand, most with Fray Bentos meat pies. While both are now UK produced they started in Victorian times, as brands coming from the Uruguayan town of Fray Bentos. All those cattle roaming the pampas turned into something that Brits could eat. What is going to happen is that we'll continue to buy what we want and desire from Europe and we'll also be free to buy as much of that South American beef etc as we wish without tariffs, quotas or restrictions. Rather a yum yum result there and most certainly not one that's going to lead to a decline in the quantity nor quality of food available in Britain.\n\nThese people just don't understand trade at all.",
