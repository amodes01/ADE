    "text": "By Alex Traiman/JNS.org\n\nIn a historic referendum on Thursday, the United Kingdom voted to leave the 28-nation European Union (EU), sending shockwaves throughout Europe and the international community. The results of the so-called \u201cBrexit\u201d vote\u201452 percent in favor of exiting the EU and 48 percent opposed\u2014call into question the identity and strength of the EU while leaving many nations, including Israel, wondering how the vote will affect policy and trade in the years ahead.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to know what is going to happen, and nothing is going to happen right away,\u201d said Dr. Oded Eran, the former Israeli ambassador to the EU.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt that Israel will be left to follow the agreements that will be made between the United Kingdom and the European Union, and to adjust its economic and trade relations with Britain accordingly,\u201d Eran told JNS.org.\n\nThe referendum\u2019s results also spurred Friday\u2019s resignation of U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron.\n\nAccording to Eran, major questions will be raised about what the vote means for the U.K. and for the ongoing strength of the EU. Following the referendum, opposition leaders in France and the Netherlands have hailed British voters\u2019 decision, calling for similar referendums on EU membership in their countries.\n\n\u201cThis is the dilemma that the European Union will face,\u201d Eran said. \u201cIf Britain was a singular case, then this would be a simpler situation.\u201d\n\nA major factor in the Brexit vote was the influx of Muslim immigration into Europe. Supporters of the Brexit suggested that Muslim immigration threatens the distinct character of European nations. Opponents of leaving the EU cited growing xenophobia and anti-Islamic sentiment in British society, often coupled with anti-Semitic sentiments.\n\nAccording to Fiamma Nirenstein\u2014a former Italian parliamentarian who served as vice president of the parliament\u2019s Committee on Foreign Affairs and as a member of the Italian delegation to the Council of Europe\u2014there are opposing views within Europe\u2019s Jewish communities on the causes, outcomes, and potential consequences of the Brexit vote.\n\nNirenstein noted that one school of thought views the Brexit vote \u201cas a sort of punishment for Europe\u201d for growing anti-Israel and anti-Semitic sentiment.\n\n\u201cOver the past century, Europe has been so bad to the Jews,\u201d Nirenstein told JNS.org. \u201cAnd increasingly now, Europe is against Israeli actions, and Europe is seeing an explosion of anti-Semitism. So in the view of one camp, there is something wrong with Europe, and something needed to happen to demonstrate that, and the Brexit vote represents this.\u201d\n\nOn the other side, Nierenstein suggested, is a second camp that views the Brexit vote negatively\u2014\u201cas an event that strengthens and empowers an illiberal right-wing sentiment throughout Europe,\u201d a sentiment that is simultaneously anti-Semitic and anti-Islamic, and at its core anti-immigration.\n\n\u201cAs a people that have ourselves been strangers in many lands, Jews have always identified with the value of welcoming the other. So this camp of Jews is against the [Brexit] vote,\u201d said Nierenstein, who also served as chairperson of the International Council of Jewish Parliamentarians.\n\nNirenstein said that Muslim immigration was an unknown experiment that ultimately contributed to the U.K. exiting the EU. \u201cThe issue of immigration is not just a European issue, but it is connected to problems that are taking place on another continent,\u201d she said.\n\nFormer ambassador Eran, who is currently a senior research fellow at Tel Aviv University\u2019s Institute for National Security Studies think tank, said the vote raises questions as to whether or not Europe will be willing and able to affect policies and solve problems outside of its borders.\n\n\u201cI think that Europe in the next two years, if not longer, will be mostly engaged in Europe, and primarily engaged in external threats which are immediate,\u201d Eran said.\n\n\u201cSo I wonder if Europe will find the strength and stamina to deal with profound issues,\u201d including those rattling the Middle East, he said.\n\nFor Israel, the vote comes against the backdrop of a French-initiated campaign to restart peace negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians. The EU has been increasingly critical of Israeli actions in recent years and recently passed a controversial regulation labeling products manufactured in Israeli settlements.\n\nThis coming week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is headed to Rome to discuss renewed peace efforts with United States Secretary of State John Kerry, who is similarly supportive of the French effort. Israel has rejected the initiative, maintaining that peace negotiations must be handled between the Israelis and Palestinians themselves, and not thrust upon the parties by outside actors.\n\nAccording to Nirenstein, the Brexit vote \u201cwill not have any effect on the renewed peace push.\u201d She added that while Europe will remain a vital trade partner with Israel, even in light of the Brexit vote, \u201cIsrael doesn\u2019t count on Europe for its future, and particularly for its long-term future.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a union of 27 nations instead of 28, they will still pass anti-Israel resolutions, and Israel must still keep up its guard against the European Union. There is a need for Israel to look beyond Europe,\u201d Nirenstein said.\n\n\u201cIsrael is increasingly looking towards other markets\u2014toward China, toward Russia, toward India,\u201d she said. \u201cAfrica is a very good market. There is more of a possibility to expand Israeli trade and its culture of innovation. These emerging markets appreciate Israel very much\u2026.It\u2019s no coincidence that Prime Minister Netanyahu is going to Africa in the coming weeks.\u201d\n\nCAP: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (right) and British Prime Minister David Cameron attend a joint press conference in Jerusalem on March 12, 2014.
