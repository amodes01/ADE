    "text": "Brexit was a political earthquake, but its shocks were felt on our streets even before the polls closed. Lakshmi D\u2019Souza felt the early fallout from the bitter battle over the EU referendum while pushing a pram through east London early on Thursday morning. D\u2019Souza passed a woman who warned her to \u201cbe careful\u201d. A man in the street was shouting racist abuse at a shopkeeper and passersby. As D\u2019Souza walked past with her baby son, he looked at her and spat on the floor. D\u2019Souza says that she fears the referendum has unleashed \u201ca frenzy of hatred\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt takes a lot more than some idiot to bother me,\u201d she says. \u201cBut the implication that this sort of behaviour will get worse because of a political decision \u2026 just blows my mind.\u201d\n\nTrue Vision, a police-funded hate-crime-reporting website, has seen a 57% increase in reporting between Thursday and Sunday, compared with the same period last month. This is not a definitive national figure \u2013 reports are also made directly to police stations and community groups \u2013 but Stop Hate UK, a reporting charity, has also seen an increase, while Tell Mama, an organisation tackling Islamophobia, which usually deals with 40-45 reports a month, received 33 within 48-72 hours.\n\nIn Great Yarmouth, Colin Goffin, who is vice-principal of an educational trust, was told about taunts and jeers being directed at eastern European workers by 10am on Friday morning \u2013 just hours after the results of the referendum had been announced. Goffin went to see a Kosovan-born friend, the manager of a car wash, to discuss the vote. In the Norfolk coastal town, 72% had voted to leave.\n\n\u201cI wanted him to know that I didn\u2019t agree with the decision, or the way that the issue of immigration had been used in the campaign,\u201d Goffin says. But when he arrived, the abuse against the multinational staff had already begun. \u201cHe told me people were slowing down to laugh at his staff, wave and mouth \u2018goodbye\u2019,\u201d Goffin says. \u201cThey had clearly not wasted any time in deciding to be hateful.\u201d\n\nUnsurprisingly, European staff members were worried by the vote. \u201cWhat was most shocking was that these guys are well liked and go out of their way to help people \u2013 up until then, they would have felt part of our community. Suddenly, people felt it was OK to suggest they should clear off \u2018home\u2019. I am angry and embarrassed by the way people from my home town acted.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen Racist graffiti in Newington Green, London. Photograph: Emma Reynolds\n\nArchitect Toni (a Spanish citizen living in Brighton) had barely touched down in the UK after a weekend in Alicante when he came across a group of men causing a disturbance at passport control. \u201cThere were four of them,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of them shouted: \u2018Why are these bloody immigrants in the same queue as we are?\u2019 His friends were laughing. They were saying it loudly so people would hear. It was very uncomfortable. I have been here four years and I have never experienced anything like this.\u201d\n\nAlthough another British passenger challenged the men, Toni said he was shaken by the incident. \u201cI am questioning whether I should stay \u2013 will I be a second-class citizen now?\u201d\n\nReports of xenophobia and racism have piled up in the media: the firebombing of a halal butchers in Walsall, graffiti on a Polish community centre in London and laminated cards reading: \u201cNo more Polish vermin\u201d apparently posted through letterboxes in Huntingdon. Asked about the rise in hate crimes during PMQs on Wednesday, David Cameron said the government would be publishing a hate-crime action plan.\n\nRacist cards sent in Huntingdon. Photograph: Huntingdon Living Facebook\n\nWhy this sudden explosion? Paul Bagguley, a sociologist based at the University of Leeds, points to the gleeful tone of the racism: \u201cThere is a kind of celebration going on; it\u2019s a celebratory racism.\u201d With immigration cited in polls as the second most common reason in voting for Brexit, \u201cpeople are expressing a sense of power and success, that they have won,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cPeople haven\u2019t changed. I would argue the country splits into two-thirds to three-quarters of people being tolerant and a quarter to a third being intolerant. And a section of that third have become emboldened. At other times, people are polite and rub along.\u201d\n\nBagguley stresses that it wasn\u2019t racist to vote leave, and that many people were voting about \u201cpolitical control\u201d, yet the Brexit campaign\u2019s relentless rhetoric about \u201ccontrolling our borders\u201d has led people who might previously have kept their intolerant views to themselves to feel legitimised. A spokesperson from campaign group Hope not Hate points out that, while not all Ukip voters are racists, it does \u201cswallow up the \u2018respectable racist\u2019 vote that might have once gone to the BNP\u201d. Bagguley agrees: \u201cPeople have to be prepared to be more critical of them and the implicit racism that runs through much of what they say.\u201d\n\nSimon Woolley, the director of Operation Black Vote, goes further. \u201cThe Brexiters, with their jingoistic rhetoric, have put the country on a war footing. By framing the debate as \u2018we want our country back\u2019, they have made immigrants the enemy and occupiers who need to be expelled.\u201d\n\nThe turmoil that followed the vote \u2013 with sterling in freefall, and the leadership of Britain\u2019s two main political parties in disarray \u2013 has also played a part, according to Bagguley. \u201cAt times of generalised social crises, people think they can get away with things in public that they would not normally do.\u201d On Tuesday, video footage emerged that appeared to show a mixed-race man being racially abused on a Manchester tram. Police have made three arrests over the incident.\n\nCorinne Abrahams, 24, witnessed a similar incident in London as she made her way home from the Glastonbury festival on Monday. As she sat on the tube at around 2pm, a man \u201cbegan shouting things such as: \u2018Russians are all scumbags\u2019 and \u2018Poles should all leave\u2019\u201d. Another passenger protested and the argument grew heated. Other travellers moved away, but Abrahams, who has Jewish heritage, says she could not stay silent. \u201cMy people have gone through all this before. I don\u2019t want it to have to happen to others. I said: \u2018You are an embarrassment to the country. No one else here agrees with what you\u2019re saying.\u2019 He replied: \u2018I\u2019m a real British man. This is my country.\u2019 It was unprovoked and disgusting.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen A National Front banner in Newcastle. Photograph: Emma Foster\n\nBagguley says that what makes the recent attacks unusual is who they are directed at. Central to the anti-EU discourse in the media over the past decade has been a sense of British people being fundamentally different from Europeans. As Scottish politics and identity moved in a new direction, this mutated into a white English nationalism \u201cthat has a resonance with racial ways of thinking\u201d, he says.\n\n\u201cThis has been the bedrock and basis for this xenophobia, directed at everybody who is a little different. It is unlike the backlash after terrorist attacks, which targeted Irish people in the 70s, or Muslims and those thought to be Muslims, more recently. It is a very generalised kind of racism oriented against any groups perceived not to be in that narrow category of white English identity.\u201d\n\nThe hate crimes recently reported to Operation Black Vote seem to confirm this. \u201cTwo Muslim women in Bethnal Green, east London, had eggs thrown at them on the street,\u201d says Woolley. \u201cA black woman on a bus had a bunch of bananas placed on the chair next to her and was told to \u2018fuck off back to your country\u2019. It is not just women. An Italian man was punched to the ground for asking another man which way he voted in the referendum.\u201d\n\nNor are attacks confined to areas that voted strongly to leave. A British Asian doctor in Urmston, Greater Manchester, tells me she was told to \u201cgo back to your own country\u201d in a petrol forecourt at the weekend by a woman annoyed she had not driven away from the pump quickly enough. \u201cYou just don\u2019t expect this in Manchester. I have never had that before,\u201d she says.\n\nIn Edinburgh, Lauren Stonebanks, 36, was on a bus on Monday when she says a woman shouted: \u201c\u2018Get your passport, you\u2019re fucking going home.\u2019\u201d She believes she was targeted because she is mixed race. \u201cAs I got off the bus, the woman started making threatening gestures, like punching gestures. It made me feel absolutely terrified.\u201d\n\nIn Cobham, Surrey, British-born Saima, 46, was shopping for her elderly mother when she, too, experienced her first brush with racism. \u201cThere was a man in his mid to late 30s ranting in the street about \u2018making Britain great again\u2019. I looked over and he pointed at me, saying: \u2018People like you will be out of here soon.\u2019 It reminds me of the 70s with the National Front, when I remember being scared for my family. I feel as if we have gone back in time.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen Neo-Nazi stickers in Glasgow. Photograph: Eoin Palmer\n\nWoolley is clear, as is Tell Mama, that hate crimes have never gone away. Tell Mama\u2019s annual report, released on Wednesday, states that anti-Muslim hatred reported to them rose by a staggering 326% in 2015. Women, especially those who wear hijabs or niqabs, bear the brunt of this. Hope Not Hate points out that it has been arguing for some time that far-right extremism is not getting the attention it deserves. Yet the Brexit-inspired racism seems slightly different in that slurs are focused on ethnicity over religion. A report to Tell Mama included an incident of a man shouting: \u201cBrexit, you Paki\u201d at a taxi driver, before assaulting him.\n\nWriter Nikesh Shukla was in Bristol on Tuesday when he witnessed an argument between a white man and a black man. As they separated, the white man shouted: \u201cWell, it\u2019s not your fucking country, is it?\u201d On Friday, a tweet about the far right in the US resulted in him being told to \u201cgo back to brownland\u201d. \u201cThe tool of the racist, more recently, has been to make you feel you have a chip on your shoulder. Now it is barefaced: \u2018Go back to your country.\u2019\u201d\n\nBBC journalist Sima Kotecha interviewed a leave voter in her home town of Basingstoke who used the word \u201cPaki\u201d. Afterwards, she tweeted: \u201cHaven\u2019t heard that word here since the 80s!\u201d For many British Asians, it is a reminder of a darker period in British history. Anna Rahman, a psychiatrist, posted on Facebook: \u201cThe first time I heard the word \u2018Paki\u2019, I was five and people were pelting eggs and stones at our windows. My father told me no one had the right to make me feel I didn\u2019t belong here, telling me: \u2018You are as British as the Queen.\u2019 It makes me want to sob that, in this climate, I may need to have this discussion with my own kids.\u201d\n\nStop Hate UK\u2019s Rose Simkin cautions that about 80-99% of hate crimes go unreported, making their prevalence hard to estimate. Woolley thinks this could be \u201cbecause they want to cleanse themselves of the experience and forget that it happened\u201d. Bagguley is confident that after a spike in incidents, things will calm down. Yet he also warns that if these attacks go unchallenged, the damage to our social fabric could be lasting, making attacks more frequent in the future. \u201cIt is the residue that is the problem. If people get away with [racist attacks], then the next time there is a reason to have a go, they will.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Imran Rahman-Jones. Some names have been changed.",
