You bet it could,\" he said.\n\nSanders has not yet dropped out of the presidential race, but said last Friday that he intends to vote for his rival Hillary Clinton in November's general election.\n\nPresident Obama warned in an interview released Tuesday that people shouldn't engage in \"hysteria\" over the United Kingdom's vote.",
