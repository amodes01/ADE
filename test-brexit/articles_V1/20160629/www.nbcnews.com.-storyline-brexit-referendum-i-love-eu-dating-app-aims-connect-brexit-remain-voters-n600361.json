Heal the pain by dating Remain https://t.co/P7bFneL3JK \u2014 RemainderApp (@remainderapp) June 27, 2016\n\nBilled as \u201cthe dating app for the people who voted to save Britain,\u201d the Remainder app won't be officially rolled out until Saturday \u2014 just one week after the U.K. voted to withdraw from the European Union \u2014 but a website set up for the app has already attracted thousands of lovelorn \u201cRemainders.\u201d'\n\nRead More: Could Brexit Be Canceled? Here's How Vote Might Be Reversed\n\nThe site's co-founders, a pair of likely lads from London who wish to remain anonymous, created the site \"as a joke\" the day after the referendum. But even in its nascent form, Andy (a second-year student) and Tim (a software developer), were \"amazed by the reaction\" \u2014 and realized they'd be numpties not to take it further.\n\n\"The British motto is to keep calm and carry on,\" said Andy, in an interview with NBC News. \"There hasn't been much of that in the last few days, but maybe everyone just needs a good shag.\"\n\n\"We thought maybe we could cheer everyone up if they got out of the house for dinner and a bottle of wine with another Remain voter,\" he said.\n\nThe Remainder team paired with a dating app provider and has been finalizing the site design in preparation for its launch this week. They also set up a crowdfunding page to cover web hosting expenses and further testing. \"Everyone's waiting for the app to land,\" Andy told NBC News.\n\nAs for its appeal: \u201cWe\u2019ve hit on the perfect indicator of kindness, intelligence, and good looks: People who voted Remain in the EU referendum,\" the site boasts.\n\nThe cheeky co-founders say they have a target of 16,141,241 sign ups \u2014 the exact number of people who voted to Remain.\n\nAnd, if misery loves company, even Americans \u2014 excluded from Europe's biggest going away party \u2014 can fine-tune their search for love across the pond: \"Want to date or meet Brits, but worried they voted Leave? Meet someone who welcomes foreigners to Britain,\" touts the site.\n\n\"Our advice for Americans wanting to date Brits is to make the first move,\" said Andy. \"We Brits get quite embarrassed about asking someone out for a date.\"",
