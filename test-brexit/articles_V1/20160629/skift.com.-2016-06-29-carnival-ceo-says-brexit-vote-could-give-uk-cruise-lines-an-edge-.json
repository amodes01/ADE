    "text": "Carnival Corporation pulled off a surprisingly good quarter despite global uncertainty, though capacity growth in China seems to be worrying some on Wall Street.\n\nTravel companies have been reeling since British voters decided late last week to leave the European Union, but Carnival Corp. president and CEO Arnold Donald sees a potential silver lining to the sterling\u2019s fall.\n\n\u201cDespite the geopolitical events in Europe, including the Brexit vote, we remain confident in our long term outlook given the attractive value proposition our strong and diversified brand portfolio offers,\u201d Donald told analysts during the company\u2019s second-quarter earnings call Tuesday.\n\nHe continued, noting that the value proposition was strong \u201cparticularly in the UK where our local brands P&O Cruises and Cunard \u2014 sold in British pounds \u2014 have an increasingly competitive advantage to land-based vacation alternatives in Europe and abroad.\u201d\n\nOther than the impact of currency exchange rates, the global cruise giant is not, at least at this point, forecasting any downturn in business due to the UK\u2019s vote to leave the EU.\n\nEven as uncertainty over the vote weighed on Europe for the last few months, Carnival reported a stronger-than-expected second fiscal quarter. Revenues increased from $3.6 billion last year to $3.7 billion this year, while net income soared from $222 million to $605 million. Costs came in lower than expected for the quarter, which ended May 31.\n\nHigher ticket prices and onboard spending, especially at bars and casinos, helped Carnival beat expectations.\n\n\u201cThis was among the most remarkable quarters in the history of the company,\u201d Donald said.\n\nLike other cruise players this year, Carnival said destinations in the Caribbean and Alaska were proving popular with cruisers from North America, while Mediterranean itineraries were a tougher sell for those travelers primarily due to \u201cgeopolitical events\u201d such as the terror attacks in Paris and Brussels. The parent company\u2019s North American brands include Carnival Cruise Line, Princess Cruises, Holland America Line, Fathom, and Seabourn.\n\nBut European brands such as Costa Cruises, AIDA Cruises, Cunard, and P&O \u2014 which typically draw passengers from the regions where they\u2019re based \u2014 have \u201cheld up well,\u201d Donald said.\n\nFor next year, Carnival Corp. is reducing its presence in Europe while growing capacity in the Caribbean and Alaska, a shuffling Donald described as \u201crebalancing our portfolio to optimize the current demand environment.\u201d\n\nThe China Challenge\n\nThe company will see a 30 percent capacity uptick in China next year, following an increase of more than 60 percent this year \u2014 huge numbers that appear to have investors worried.\n\nDonald and chief financial officer David Bernstein were careful to point out that the percent increases seemed large because they were building on small numbers. China represents 5 percent of Carnival\u2019s global deployment for 2016, and will grow to 6 percent of capacity next year.\n\n\u201cIn China, our occupancy levels remain comparable to the high levels we have consistently achieved as we introduce hundreds of thousands of new-to-cruise to our brand,\u201d Donald said. He said the penetration rate for the market is less than 1 percent, and earnings have been proportionate to capacity growth.\n\nBut ticket prices are lower as China absorbs new ships not only from Carnival brands but also from competitors including Royal Caribbean.\n\n\u201cWe had previously indicated that the ticket prices were higher than the fleet average,\u201d Bernstein said. \u201cAnd at this point in time, the ticket prices are in line with the overall fleet average, but it\u2019s really an apples and oranges comparison, because in China you\u2019ve got a much higher percentage of the fleet is in the contemporary brands.\u201d\n\nIn other words, the ships sailing in China are not from the luxury brands that command top dollar, but rather the larger vessels that attract mass-market (and more budget-conscious) passengers. So, Bernstein argued, stacking the pricing in China up against the entire group of more than 100 ships isn\u2019t quite fair \u2014 even though the cruise company has made that exact comparison in the past.\n\nDespite the lower pricing, Donald said he remained confident in the long-term prospects for the market.\n\n\u201cOverall, China remains a robust opportunity and we\u2019re still at the very, very beginning of it,\u201d Donald said.\n\nIn a note to investors titled \u201cThe China Concern,\u201d UBS Investment Research analyst Robin Farley wrote that China operations still add value to the company\u2019s earnings and pricing is higher than the average for the individual brands that are there.\n\n\u201cThe concern among investors is that as more supply is added to China, pricing could decline to the point where it is not accretive on all these levels,\u201d she wrote. \u201cSo despite the raise in \u201916 yield guidance, the China controversy will continue in \u201917.\u201d",
