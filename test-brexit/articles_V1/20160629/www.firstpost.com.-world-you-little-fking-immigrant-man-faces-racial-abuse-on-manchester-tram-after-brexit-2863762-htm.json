One of the assailants, who was carrying a bottle of beer, even flicked alcohol from the bottle at Jasso in the tram.\n\nHowever, other people in the tram eventually stood by Jasso and the three teenagers had to leave the tram. One of the other commuters even told the three teenagers, \u201cYou are an absolute disgrace to England.\u201d\n\nAccording to CNN , police in Manchester arrested two young men and a teenager in connection with the incident.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOver 100 incidents of racial abuse and hate crimes have been reported since the UK voted to leave the EU, PTI had reported. \u201cWe should be absolutely clear that this government will not tolerate intolerance\u2026 intimidating migrants, telling them they need to go home,\u201d outgoing British PM David Cameron\u2019s Downing Street spokesperson had said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo combat the rising number of hate crimes post-Brexit, a Twitter user came up with the idea that people should wear a safety pin to show solidarity and support for the immigrants living in the UK.\n\nThe idea being that anyone against the sort of nationalistic, racist violence we've been seeing could identify themselves as a \"safe\" ally. \u2014 miss pommery 1926 \u270a (@cheeahs) June 26, 2016\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI'd like to come up with something that can be made by anybody anywhere to pin on their jacket or coat to signify that they are an ally. \u2014 miss pommery 1926 \u270a (@cheeahs) June 26, 2016\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI quite like the idea of just putting a safety pin, empty of anything else, on your coat. A literal SAFETY pin! \u2014 miss pommery 1926 \u270a (@cheeahs) June 26, 2016\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeople soon started tweeting with #safetypin with images of them wearing a safety pin.\n\nWearing a #SafetyPin this morning.
