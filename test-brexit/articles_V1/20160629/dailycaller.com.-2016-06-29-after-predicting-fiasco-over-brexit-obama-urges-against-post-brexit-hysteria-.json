    "text": "President Barack Obama went on National Public Radio on Tuesday to urge Americans to remain calm after last week\u2019s United Kingdom vote to quit the European Union despite making crazy threats about the consequences of a Brexit vote just a few weeks ago.\n\n\u201cI think that the best way to think about this is: a pause button has been pressed on the project of full European integration,\u201d Obama told NPR on Tuesday concerning the Brexit vote.\n\n\u201cI would not overstate it,\u201d Obama also said. \u201cThere\u2019s been a little bit of hysteria post-Brexit vote, as if somehow NATO\u2019s gone, the trans-Atlantic alliance is dissolving and every country is rushing off to its own corner. That\u2019s not what\u2019s happening.\u201d\n\nWATCH:\n\nObama\u2019s reaction to the reality of the Brexit referendum is a far cry from his stance prior to the vote.\n\nIn late April \u2014 66 days ago \u2014 Obama decided it would be a good idea to threaten ordinary British people with the possibility that the United States could wait an entire decade to establish a free trade pact with a post-EU United Kingdom.\n\n\u201cIt could be five years from now, 10 years from now before we\u2019re actually able to get something done,\u201d Obama said during an April visit to Britain to celebrate Queen Elizabeth\u2019s 90th birthday, according to The Guardian.\n\nThe United States would leave Great Britain in the economic lurch and finish trade talks with the European Union first instead, Obama said \u2014 apparently laboring under the belief that the United States cannot negotiate two trade agreements simultaneously.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t anticipate that anything I\u2019ve said will change the position of those who are leading the campaigns in one direction or the other, but for ordinary voters I thought it would be relevant to hear what the president of the United States, who loves the British people and cares deeply about this relationship, has to say,\u201d Obama sad in April, according to The Guardian.\n\nThis week, though, Obama told NPR he respects the will of British voters and now anticipates no \u201cmajor cataclysmic changes as a consequence of this\u201d \u2014 such as, say, a decade-long lull in U.S.-British trade relations due to an inability to sign an agreement between allies with an alliance lasting roughly two centuries.\n\n\u201cKeep in mind that Norway is not a member of the European Union, but Norway is one of our closest allies,\u201d Obama told NPR. \u201cThey align themselves on almost every issue with Europe and us. They are a place that is continually supporting the kinds of initiatives internationally that we support, and, if over the course of what is going to be at least a two-year negotiation between England and Europe, Great Britain ends up being affiliated to Europe like Norway is, the average person is not going to notice a big change.\u201d\n\nObama also took a trade-related swipe at presumed 2016 Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump in the NPR interview.\n\n\u201cMr. Trump embodies global elites and has taken full advantage of it his entire life,\u201d Obama said. \u201cSo, he\u2019s hardly a spokesperson \u2014 a legitimate spokesperson \u2014 for a populist surge of working-class people on either side of the Atlantic.\u201d\n\nOn June 23, 51.9 percent of British citizens voted to leave the European Union, with 48.1 voting to stay. Nearly three-fourths of Great Britain\u2019s voting public turned out to the polls, which is just over 33.5 million people.\n\nFollow Eric on Twitter. Like Eric on Facebook.
