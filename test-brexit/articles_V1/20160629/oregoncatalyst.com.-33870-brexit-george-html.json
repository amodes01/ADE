    "text": "Last week two momentous events (well maybe just one) occurred; both triggered by the same phenomena.\n\nVoters in Great Britain, by a margin of fifty-two percent to forty-eight percent, elected to exit the European Union. The Saturday edition of the Wall Street Journal characterized it thusly:\n\n\u201cVoters defied the impassioned \u2013 and unified \u2013 opposition of the leadership of all five major political parties. They rejected the advice of more than 1,200 corporate CEO\u2019s, including half of the chiefs of the FTSE 100 companies who wrote to The Times newspaper last week urging rejection of \u2018Brexit.\u2019 \u201cBanks in the City of London, one of the world\u2019s major financial centers, along with the Bank of England, the country\u2019s central bank, and most of its influential think tanks and academic institutions, had warned of the risks to the U.K.\u2019s economic security and global financial pre-eminence if Britain did not stay in the EU. A procession of eminent foreigners, from most head of European governments to James Dimon, the CEO of J.P. Morgan Chase, had urged a vote to stay.\u201d\n\nEven the \u201cmost beloved leader\u201d of the modern free world, President Barack Obama, warned the British voters that if they didn\u2019t listen to his advice that Great Britain would move to the \u201cback of the queue\u201d in negotiating international trade agreements.\n\nHow dare they? How dare that scurvy crew of commoners ignore the superior advice of their betters? What were they thinking to ignore Mr. Obama\u2019s paterfamilias warning? What good is being \u201can elite\u201d if no one listens to you?\n\nWhich brings us to the other \u201cmomentous\u201d event. George Will, noted columnist and smug prig, resigned from the Republican Party because the great unwashed in America\u2019s heartland ignored his superior advice and instead chose Donald Trump to be the presidential nominee for the Republican Party. (Yes, \u201cprig\u201d is a word. No, it doesn\u2019t mean what you think. Yes, it in fact describes Mr. Will to a tee.)\n\nWhile the former event will have consequences, albeit not nearly as catastrophic as the elites warned, the latter fits neatly into the category of \u201cwho gives a damn\u201d \u2013 with the possible exception of Mr. Will\u2019s spouse and the jury is still out on that.\n\nMr. Will possesses the same Brahmin pedigree (Trinity College, Oxford and Princeton) that many of the \u201cruling elites\u201d do in both America and Europe. While small in numbers they are large in influence mostly because they (like Oregon\u2019s Democrat Party) marry each other, have affairs with each other, hire each other, appoint each other, ensure their offspring are encased in privilege, and exclude virtually anyone that does not possess a similar pedigree. They are both Democrats and Republicans, Conservatives and Liberals (Progressives, or whatever the are calling themselves these days). They enter and exit government service like a revolving door. When voters change the party in power, they simply move from the majority office to the minority office \u2013 same people, different titles. Or some move from government to one of Washington, D.C.\u2019s high powered law or lobbying firms where they are paid handsome sums while they wait to reenter government (and do favors for the client\u2019s of their employers) at the next changing of the guard. And along the way they line their pockets by selling influence \u2013 none have been better at this than former President Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary Clinton \u2013 two bites of the apple are always better than one.\n\nWashington\u2019s government elites, like Mr. Will, are nearly apoplectic about the prospects of a Trump presidency in which they will have no influence. They, including the Republican elites, much prefer Ms. Clinton because, after all, she is a member of the club and while they may lose their current title and office temporarily, they will remain a member of the inner circle simply awaiting their inevitable return to high office. I mean, really, who cares if the Clintons have been brazen in their insatiable quest to enrich themselves by selling influence; haven\u2019t they all drank from the same cup themselves?\n\nIt is of little consequence if the nation continues in an economic malaise, if it slides further into debt, if the march to a welfare state continues at an accelerated pace, if the prestige and influence of the nation continues to wane, or if the number of terrorist attacks from a growing Islamic jihadist cadre swells. So long as the elites remain secure in their power and influence, so long as their accumulation of wealth continues, so longs as they are protected by gun-toting security, the world will be a better place and the rest of us will just have to get used to it.\n\nWe fought a revolution to get rid of the smug aristocracy of England. Now two hundred years later we have our own inbred smug aristocracy running the show.\n\nIn the end, Great Britain and the European Union will settle on their divorce, although the Brits will be made to pay a price for ignoring the directives of their own elites and life will go on. And in America, George Will will rejoin the Republican Party after he and the other Republican elites ensure the election of Ms. Clinton, and I will leave then leave the Republican Party for just that reason.",
