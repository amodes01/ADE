    "text": "\"One thing that will not change is the special relationship between our two countries\"\n\nPresident Obama said on Friday that the recent \u201cBrexit\u201d vote in the United Kingdom to leave the European Union won\u2019t change the \u201cspecial relationship\u201d between the two nations.\n\nDuring remarks that the 2016 Global Entrepreneurship Summit, Obama said he had recently spoken to British Prime Minister David Cameron, a strong supporter of remaining in the E.U., who said he would resign by the end of the year in the wake of the Brexit vote. Obama called Cameron an \u201coutstanding friend and partner\u201d and said he is confident the United Kingdom is \u201ccommitted to an orderly transition out of the European Union.\u201d\n\nPresident Obama said the vote on Thursday was an indication of the \u201congoing changes and challenges raised by globalization,\u201d but the president said the vote will not have an impact on the U.S.\u2019s relationship with the U.K.\n\n\u201cOne thing that will not change is the special relationship between our two countries,\u201d Obama said Friday, adding that the U.K.\u2019s membership in NATO was also important.\n\nThe President, who also supported Britain remaining part of the E.U., has previously implied that America would be slow to sign a free trade agreement with the U.K. should it vote in favor of leaving the union.\n\n\u201cThere might be a U.K.-U.S. trade agreement, but it\u2019s not going to happen anytime soon,\u201d Obama said in April, referring to a possible Brexit, adding that the U.K. would be pushed to the \u201cback of the queue\u201d on trade.\n\nIn a statement released by the White House earlier on Friday, Obama said the vote did not impact the U.S.\u2019s relationship with the European Union either.\n\n\u201cThe United Kingdom and the European Union will remain indispensable partners of the United States even as they begin negotiating their ongoing relationship to ensure continued stability, security, and prosperity for Europe, Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and the world,\u201d the statement reads.\n\nPresident Obama spoke at the Global Entrepreneurship Summit in Silicon Valley where he also sat in on a panel discussion with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and three entrepreneurs.",
