    "text": "The British people\u2019s decision to leave the European Union (E.U.) was an \u201canti-insanity vote\u201d allowing the United Kingdom to regain control over its sovereignty and borders, according to Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-TX).\n\n\u201cI think the vote on Brexit was an anti-insanity vote. They\u2019ve been allowing the European Union to force them to take people who are a threat to them,\u201d Gohmert said during an appearance on Fox News Channel. He was tying Thursday\u2019s Brexit vote to the \u201cinsanity\u201d of House Democrats staging a sit-in on the House floor over gun violence in reaction to the Orlando terror attack \u2014 carried out by an Islamic radical.\n\nGohmert explained there is a similar feeling in the U.S., where Americans feel their government is not working for them and ignoring the true threats to their safety.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why [Donald] Trump is so popular, people are sick of it,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Texas lawmaker argued that the unfettered influx of Syrian refugees \u201cplayed a part\u201d in driving the Brexit vote in the U.K.\n\n\u201cPeople want leadership that is using common sense and the European Union has been saying, \u2018Hey,\u2019 \u2013 like [Angela] Merkel in Germany \u2013 \u2018We\u2019ll take all comers.\u2019 And there is this mass refugee surge into Europe and England, since they\u2019re part of the European Union, any of the Syrian fighters, the ISIS warriors that come in as they say they are. They have to take those.\u201d\n\nGohmert compared the E.U. to the U.S. federal government, saying that just like the U.K.\u2019s relationship with E.U. leaders in Brussels, the states are \u201csick of the stupid decisions being made\u201d in Washington, D.C.\n\n\u201cThere is the wrong prescription and wrong diagnosis being made here in America,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Islamic State is at war with us and it\u2019s high time we got after the enemy.\u201d",
