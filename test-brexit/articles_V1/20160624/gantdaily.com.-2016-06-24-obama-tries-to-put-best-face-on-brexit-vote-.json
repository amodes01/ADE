    "text": "President Barack Obama said Friday that the relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom will not change following the Brexit vote.\n\n\u201cWhile the UK\u2019s relationship with the EU will change, one thing that will not change is the special relationship that exists between our two nations,\u201d Obama said during remarks at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, after Britons decided to separate from the European Union. \u201cThat will endure.\u201d\n\nObama noted that the referendum, characterized by a fierce populist debate on issues like immigration and the economy, spoke to \u201cthe ongoing changes and challenges that are raised by globalization.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile the UK\u2019s relationship with the EU will change, one thing that will not change is the special relationship that exists between our two nations. That will endure,\u201d said Obama, who in April visited London to urge the country to stay a European member state.\n\nThe President spoke with British Prime Minister David Cameron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Friday, saying afterwards that the EU will remain a \u201cvital\u201d U.S. partner, alongside NATO.\n\n\u201cOur shared values including our commitment to democracy and pluralism \u2026 will continue to unite all of us,\u201d Obama said, repeating a common theme in his addresses as criticism of immigrants and religious minorities has featured in the presidential campaign.\n\nOther top U.S. leaders across the political spectrum also stressed continuity in America\u2019s relationship with the UK, even as the result roiled global economic markets, surprised friends and allies, and raised questions about the political future of both Europe and London.\n\nIn a statement earlier Friday, Obama said that the U.S. respected the decision in which nearly 52% voted to leave while 48% preferred to stay.\n\n\u201cThe people of the United Kingdom have spoken, and we respect their decision,\u201d he said. As pundits repeatedly used the analogy of divorce, the President made clear that America would not be choosing sides.\n\nVice President Joe Biden, the administration\u2019s less-filtered voice, spoke in Ireland about White House disappointment at the result.\n\n\u201cI must say we had looked for a different outcome,\u201d he said in Dublin. \u201cWe preferred a different outcome.\u201d\n\nLike other leaders, Biden stressed his respect for the decision and used words that cropped up repeatedly in official reactions, stressing the depth, closeness and endurance of the bond between the two countries that share history and cultural roots, and cooperate deeply on foreign policy and intelligence.\n\nThese leaders were trying in part to calm tumbling global markets as stocks reeled in the vote\u2019s aftermath.\n\nU.S. stocks plummeted almost 500 points Friday morning for their biggest drop in 10 months, a concrete reflection of how politics on one side of the Atlantic can profoundly affect the other.\n\nHillary Clinton, the Democratic party\u2019s presumptive presidential nominee, focused on the potential economic ripple effects and stressed the need to reaffirm the U.S. commitment to the special relationship it has with both the UK and the EU.\n\n\u201cOur first task has to be to make sure that the economic uncertainty created by these events does not hurt working families here in America,\u201d Clinton said in a statement that drew an indirect comparison to Trump, her likely Republican rival.\n\n\u201cThis time of uncertainty only underscores the need for calm, steady, experienced leadership in the White House to protect Americans\u2019 pocketbooks and livelihoods, to support our friends and allies, to stand up to our adversaries, and to defend our interests,\u201d Clinton said.\n\nRepublicans sounded the same notes, stressing their respect for the decision as well as the stability of the U.S.-UK relationship. House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, tweeted that \u201cthe UK is an indispensable ally of the US, and that special relationship is unaffected by this vote.\u201d\n\nSen. Richard Burr, a the North Carolina Republican chairman of the Senate intelligence committee, said that \u201cwhile there will be a great deal of discussion in the coming days and weeks about what the \u2018Leave\u2019 win means for them and for us, our friends and allies in the UK should know this: we respect their decision, and we stand by them, just as they have always stood by us.\u201d\n\nOthers used the vote to make a point about domestic politics. Sen. Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican who casts himself as a political outsider intent on reforming a corrupt and moribund Washington, said the result should remind leaders in Washington and elsewhere that \u201cour citizens are dissatisfied with stagnant economies, declining wages, uncontrolled migration, rising crime, and terror attacks at home.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to abandon the failed policies of the past and solve the real problems of the present,\u201d Cotton said. He added that the U.S. should now begin free-trade discussions with the UK, an issue that came up during Obama\u2019s April visit to London.\n\nAt the time, Obama had suggested that the UK would pay for a \u201cno\u201d vote economically, getting less preferential trade consideration, and that security ties might be affected as well.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say that maybe some point down the line, there might be a UK-U.S. trade agreement, but it\u2019s not going to happen anytime soon, because our focus is in negotiating with a big bloc, the European Union, to get a trade agreement done,\u201d Obama said on April 22.\n\n\u201cThe UK is going to be in the back of the queue,\u201d the President added, \u201cnot because we don\u2019t have a special relationship, but because, given the heavy lift on any trade agreement, us having access to a big market with a lot of countries \u2014 rather than trying to do piecemeal trade agreements \u2014 is hugely inefficient.\u201d\n\nTrump seized on that to claim that Obama may have pushed voters to vote against staying in the EU, and knocked him for his comments that the UK would be at the back of the line.\n\n\u201cA lot of people don\u2019t like him,\u201d Trump said of Obama. \u201cHis recommendation perhaps caused it to fail.\u201d\n\nTrump, who backed the \u201cleave\u201d campaign, said Friday that, \u201cI was actually very surprised that President Obama would\u2019ve come over here and he would\u2019ve been so bold as to tell the people over here what to do.\u201d\n\nTrump also accused Clinton of opposing the Brexit \u201cbecause Obama wanted it\u201d and slammed his understanding of the public mood.\n\nWith Europe facing unprecedented terrorist attacks this year, Obama also touched in April on security, noting that global challenges require \u201ccollective action,\u201d and that the vote\u2019s outcome \u201cis a matter of deep interest to the United States because it affects our prospects as well.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. \u201cwants a strong United Kingdom as a partner,\u201d he said, in part because of the leverage the UK can bring to bear inside the EU, with which the U.S. cooperates on a vast array of issues, from the Iran nuclear deal to climate change, Russia\u2019s aggression in Ukraine and stability in Asia.\n\n\u201cThe United Kingdom is at its best when it\u2019s helping to lead a strong Europe,\u201d Obama said during his London visit.\n\nOn Friday, Obama made clear that despite the vote, \u201cthe United Kingdom and the European Union will remain indispensable partners of the United States even as they begin negotiating their ongoing relationship to ensure continued stability, security, and prosperity for Europe, Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and the world.\u201d\n\nSpeaking in Washington, Deputy Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that the U.S. would help to ensure the UK exit, expected to take about two years, goes smoothly. He also stressed the special U.S. ties to the UK, and then added a point on many minds.\n\n\u201cFor sure,\u201d Blinken said, \u201cit\u2019s going to be a complicated process.\u201d",
