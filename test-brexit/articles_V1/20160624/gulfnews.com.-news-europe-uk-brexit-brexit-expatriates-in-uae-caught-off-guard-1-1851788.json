    "text": "Dubai: A hallmark decision cast on Thursday by UK voters to end the 43-year membership in the European Union caught British expatriates living in the UAE off guard.\n\nExpats who spoke to Gulf News questioned the future of their home country following news that the \u2018Leave\u2019 side garnered 1.2 million more votes than the \u2018Remain\u2019 camp, following a highly divisive campaign, to clinch 52 per cent of the vote.\n\nThe shock of the UK\u2019s departure within the next two years deepened on Friday when Prime Minister David Cameron announced he will resign by October to allow 150,000 Tory party members to appoint a new prime minister to negotiate the country\u2019s exit.\n\nIt will be up to a new prime minister to trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which sets forth a two-year timetable to \u2018Leave\u2019 the EU, reducing country membership to 27.\n\nJonathan Howell-Jones, a UK expat living in Dubai, said he was disheartened by the referendum outcome and wondered what the future holds for Great Britain if a member of the union such as Scotland could hold their own referendum to \u2018Leave\u2019 the UK.\n\n\u201cI am gutted,\u201d said Howell-Jones, adding Great Britain could soon be \u201cLittle England\u201d if the Kingdom were to be broken up by further referenda. \u201cThe biggest concern I have is that the heart was clearly over the head. I think this is a black day in our history.\u201d\n\nHowell-Jones said the vote in favour of \u2018Leave\u2019 may not bode well for UK expats living abroad and in the UAE given that the UK may now be viewed as isolationist.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it will reflect well on the British community here in the UAE,\u201d he said.\n\nHolly Stringer, a UK expat living in the UAE, said she was feeling mixed emotions for the UK of tomorrow.\n\n\u201cI am happy and scared at the same time,\u201d Stringer told Gulf News.\n\nExpat Jon Clarke, a resident of Dubai, said Friday was a good day for the UK and restores sovereignty to the country.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m surprised. I didn\u2019t think we would do it. I thought we would bottle it and not \u2018Leave\u2019,\u201d Clarke told Gulf News on Friday. \u201cThis is a very good thing and will get rid of the EU bureaucrats meddling in the UK\u2019s affairs.\u201d\n\nClarke, 46, said those who voted to \u2018Leave\u2019 did not believe appointed EU officials should hold so much sway over the internal running of the country.\n\n\u201cTo keep UK in the EU financial stream was okay at one point but to interfere in our country\u2019s political decisions was just wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a good day for England.\u201d\n\nThe reaction on social media was mixed with some lamenting that the decision to \u2018Leave\u2019 was an embarassing moment both personally and internationally.\n\nOrlando Crowcroft, a former UK expat living in Dubai, voiced his displeasure at the vote on his Facebook account.\n\n\u201cShocked, really, ashamed, worried \u2013 but embarassed mostly,\u201d he said.\n\nThe UK Ambassador to the United Arab Emirates Philip Parham said in a statement to Gulf News on Friday: \u201cThe UK remains the fifth largest economy in the world, a permanent member of the UN Security Council and a member of the G7, G20 and NATO [and will ] continue to be the only member of those groups which spends both 2% of GDP on defence and 0.7 per cent on development assistance. As the Prime Minister has emphasised, Britain\u2019s economy is fundamentally strong.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the numbers of UK expats who voted in the referendum from the UAE have not been released.\n\nIn order to cast their ballots from UAE, UK expatriates living in the UAE were advised to register online by May 16 of this year, seven days before the June 23 referendum vote.\n\nOf 5.5 million UK expats living abroad, there were 106,000 overseas electors on the commission\u2019s register.\n\nThere are an estimated 120,000 British nationals living in the UAE.",
