    "text": "In the wake of Britain's vote to leave the European Union, Prime Minister David Cameron has announced his resignation \u2013 and former mayor of London Boris Johnson is a leading contender to take Cameron's place.\n\n\n\nJohnson was the most prominent supporter of the \"leave\" campaign as voters headed to the polls over the historic decision widely known as Brexit. And, with the results in, Johnson has emerged as the big winner.\n\n\n\nIn a statement on Friday, Johnson paid tribute to Cameron, calling him \"brave\" and \"one of the most extraordinary politicians of our age.\"\n\n\n\nAlthough he did not mention succeeding Cameron, he hailed voters' decision in favor of Brexit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWho Is Boris Johnson? Leader of Brexit Supporters Could Be Britain's Next Prime Minister| politics, London, Around the Web\n\n\n\n\"They have decided it is time to vote to take back control from a European Union that has become too opaque and not accountable enough to the people it is meant to serve,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\"And to those who may be anxious both at home and abroad, this does not mean that the United Kingdom will be in any way less united, it does not mean it will be any less European.\"\n\n\n\nJohnson, with his shock of wild blonde hair, has gained prominence following the Brexit vote \u2013 but just who is the flamboyant politician? Here are four things you need to know about the former London mayor.\n\n\n\n1. He Was Born in America\n\n\n\nDon't be fooled by his thick British accent, Johnson was born in New York and has held a U.S. passport.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHis family lived in the city after his father, Stanley \u2013 a prize-winning poet \u2013 won a fellowship.\n\n\n\n2. He Got Stuck on a Zip-Line During the 2012 London Olympics. No, Really\n\n\n\nDuring a promotional appearance for the London Olympics, the former journalist became stuck on a zip-line and was left dangling as onlookers snapped photos.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe stunt looked promising as Johnson took off down the line, waving two U.K. flags. But things began going downhill \u2013 or down line \u2013 when he began sliding the opposite way before coming to a halt.\n\n\n\n\"I want you to know, it's very, very well organized,\" he joked of the event. \"Get me a ladder. I think they needed to test it on somebody going a bit faster.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWho Is Boris Johnson? Leader of Brexit Supporters Could Be Britain's Next Prime Minister| politics, London, Around the Web\n\n\n\n3. He Faced Backlash After Criticizing President Obama\n\n\n\nDuring Obama's April visit to London to meet with Queen Elizabeth II on her 90th birthday \u2013 and to urge Britons to vote against the Brexit \u2013 Johnson penned an essay published in The Sun blasting the president's opposition to Brexit.\n\n\n\n\"For the United States to tell us in the U.K. that we must surrender control of so much of our democracy \u2013 it is a breathtaking example of the principle of so-as-I-say-but-not-as-I-do,\" Johnson wrote. \"It is incoherent. It is inconsistent, and yes it is downright hypocritical.\"\n\n\n\nHe also mentioned a bust of Winston Churchill that was removed from the Oval Office in 2009, writing, \"some said it was a symbol of the part-Kenyan President's ancestral dislike of the British empire.\"\n\n\n\nMany condemned Johnson's essay, with Nicholas Soames, a Conservative Parliament member and a grandson of Churchill, calling it an \"appalling article\" that is \"totally wrong on almost everything.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAppalling article by @BorisJohnson in Sun totally wrong on almost everything. Inconceivable WSC wld not have welcomed Presidents views \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Nicholas Soames (@nsoamesmp) April 22, 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMask slips again. Boris part-Kenyan Obama comment is yet another example of dog whistle racism from senior Tories. He should withdraw it. \u00e2\u0080\u0094 John McDonnell MP (@johnmcdonnellMP) April 22, 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n4. He's Had to Apologize \u2013 a Lot\n\n\n\nJohnson's mussed blond hair, sharp wit and rogue ways have grabbed the attention of many Britons during his eight-year stint as mayor. But the former journalist has had his share of dark moments.\n\n\n\nThe politician was forced to apologize for racist comments after calling Black people \"piccaninnies\" in 2008, according to CNN.\n\n\n\nHe also came under fire for referring to people from Papua New Guinea as cannibals, according to the Associated Press.",
