They're angry over borders, they're angry over people coming into the country and taking over and nobody even knows who they are,\" said the businessman at the Scottish resort he bought two years ago.\n\nJust arrived in Scotland. Place is going wild over the vote. They took their country back, just like we will take America back. No games! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 24, 2016\n\nHillary Clinton, who is presumed to be Trump\u2019s Democratic rival in the presidential race, had initially urged Britons to stay in the EU, but released a statement saying the she \"respect[s] the choice the people of the United Kingdom have made.\"\n\nPredicting that there could be \"economic uncertainty\" created by the move, Clinton said that the first ask for Americans is to make sure any such downturn \"does not hurt working families\" back home.\n\nThe candidate used the opportunity to take a subtle jab at Trump and position herself as a more level-headed candidate.\n\n\"This time of uncertainty only underscores the need for calm, steady, experienced leadership in the White House to protect Americans\u2019 pocketbooks and livelihoods, to support our friends and allies, to stand up to our adversaries, and to defend our interests,\" Clinton said.\n\n\"We respect the choice the people of the United Kingdom have made.\" \u2014Hillary #BrexitVotepic.twitter.com/58yM8oDkL6 \u2014 Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) June 24, 2016\n\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, Clinton\u2019s rival in the Democratic primary, was also worried about the implications of the vote.\n\n\"I think it\u2019s a decision for the British people but I have concerns,\" Sanders said in a Friday interview with CBS This Morning. \"I have concerns you know when we think back over the last 100 years and the horrible wars, the kind of blood that was shed throughout Europe \u2013 the idea of the countries coming closer together is something that we want to see.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan did not take a firm position on the referendum one way or the other, but assured those in the United Kingdom that their relationship with the US would not be affected by their departure from the EU.\n\n\"I respect the decision made by the people of the United Kingdom,\" Ryan said in a statement Friday morning. \"The UK is an indispensable ally of the United States, and that special relationship is unaffected by this vote.\"\n\nSen. Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas), who had previously warned President Obama against punishing the UK for leaving the EU, made a statement on Friday morning saying that he respects the decision of the British people to exercise their \"their sovereign right of self-government\" and leave the bloc.\n\n\"Now is the time to preserve and strengthen our special relationship with the United Kingdom, which remains our closest NATO ally and a key member of the Five Eyes intelligence alliance,\" Cotton said, adding that the US should now begin new trade negotiations with the UK.\n\n\"Meanwhile, the result of this referendum should remind leaders in Washington, London, Brussels, and across Europe that our citizens are dissatisfied with stagnant economies, declining wages, uncontrolled migration, rising crime, and terror attacks at home. It's time to abandon the failed policies of the past and solve the real problems of the present,\" Cotton said. (RT)",
