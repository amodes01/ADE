New York Times writer Roger Cohen said Brexit was a \"colossal leap in the dark,\" while columnist Paul Krugman told readers to \"grieve for Europe.\"\n\n\n\nFusion\u2019s Senior Editor Felix Salmon similarly wrote that he was \u201cgrieving\u201d because \u201cthe world of hope, the world of ever-closer union among countries which for centuries would kill each other by the million\u201d ended with Brexit.\n\n\n\nSalmon's headline declared, \u201cWith a single vote, England just screwed us all.\u201d Several journalists retweeted that article.\n\nI\u2019m not going in to the Fusion offices today, I\u2019m calling in sad cc @nickrizzo \u2014 Felix Salmon (@felixsalmon) June 24, 2016\n\nPlenty of others in the media hyped the \u201crisk\u201d of Brexit, too:\n\n\n\n.@Austan_Goolsbee: I think Europe will have a recession.

It's that the world is about to rearrange in ways that are different and worse. \u2014 Nicholas Thompson (@nxthompson) June 24, 2016\n\nReckless Brexit should now give renewed momentum to Scottish independence movement, threatening unity of UK itself. \u2014 Michael Kimmelman (@kimmelman) June 24, 2016\n\nI picked the wrong day to stop sniffing glue. #Brexit \u2014 Peter Spiegel (@SpiegelPeter) June 24, 2016\n\nOutside of fear, there was loathing from journalists. A New York Times editorial from June 24, described Britain as \u201cvulnerable nationalist, antiglobalization and anti-immigrant sentiments.\u201d\n\n\u201cWill the British precedent embolden other xenophobic movements, weakening the remaining union?\u201d editors asked.\n\nBesides Bort claiming the \"ignorant are officially running the world\" and Salmon saying the Brexit referendum was \"idiotic,\" several journalists tweeted insults, with some blaming Brexit on ignorant or prejudiced voters.\n\n#Brexit takeaway: warnings of financial risk and catastrophe are an insufficient campaign against nativism & xenophobia cc @HillaryClinton \u2014 Andrea Bernstein (@AndreaWNYC) June 24, 2016\n\nBrexit a clear signal, albeit not surprisingly, for increased skepticism when it comes to all polling that involves xenophobia and racism. \u2014 Michael Kimmelman (@kimmelman) June 24, 2016\n\nHere's a secret most brown/black folks knew all along: always bet on racism/xenophobia. #Brexit \u2014 DigitalBridget (@BridgetMarie) June 24, 2016",
