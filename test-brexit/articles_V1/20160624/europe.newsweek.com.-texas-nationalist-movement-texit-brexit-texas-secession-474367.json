It is now important for Texas to look to \u202a \u200e Brexit as an inspiration and an example that Texans can also take control of our destiny. It is time for Texans to rally with us and fight for the right to become a self-governing nation.\"\n\nThe Texas Nationalist Movement bills itself as the \"largest independence movement in the United States\" and one of the largest in the world. Members say they have been recruiting support from hundreds of elected officials in the state legislature and have been collecting signatures from voters, asking them to pledge a \"yes\" vote.\n\nThe movement suffered a blow at the Texas Republican Convention in May, when state delegates declined to endorse the idea of a referendum on secession, but that it got as far as it did was a surprise to many who have dismissed a Texit as an impractical solution dreamed up by a fringe movement.\n\nNow, with Britons voting to go it alone, Texas nationalists are getting a second wind. Across social media Friday, revitalized Lone Stars voiced their support under the hashtag #Texit, saying it's time to take the idea seriously. Like the Brexit movement, the modern rise of Texas nationalism is driven by a mix of economic and political ideals, including a conservative distaste for big government and polarizing attitudes toward immigration policies. Underpinning both movements is the idea that large unions are no longer serving the needs of their individual member states.\n\nThe matter of Texas has bubbled up from time to time since the Civil War, in part due to the state's unique history. Texas declared independence from Mexico in 1836 and was a sovereign country for a decade before becoming annexed by the United States.\n\nBut despite the popular belief that the current Texas constitution gives the state the right to pull out of the United States at will, the Supreme Court has said otherwise, ruling in 1869 that states can't unilaterally secede from the union, as the Texas Tribune noted.\n\nStill, that same news outlet conceded in April that the secession debate is \"getting kind of real,\" while the Texas Nationalist Movement points out that no actual law exists that expressly forbids secession. As our friends across the pond proved Thursday, anything is possible.\n\nChristopher Zara covers media and culture. News tips? Email me. Find me on Twitter and Facebook.",
