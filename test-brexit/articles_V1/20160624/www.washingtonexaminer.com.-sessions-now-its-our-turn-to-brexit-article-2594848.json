    "text": "MISSION IMPROBABLE: They didn\u2019t see this coming. Just as the services were breathing a little easier with fresh money from Congress for spare parts and maintenance operations to begin to restore the readiness of their crippled aviation squadrons, the big guy issued orders to march in double time. On Tuesday, news broke that Defense Secretary Jim Mattis issued a memo last month to the Air Force and Navy departments giving them just 12 months to get 80 percent of their fighter jets fit for combat.\n\nWhile no one is complaining publicly, several of the players in the tactical aviation units I talked to yesterday indicated that Mattis\u2019 tall order may be a tad unrealistic. \u201cUp to now our talking point has been that it took us years to get into this problem, it\u2019s going to take years to get out,\u201d said one officer who asked not to be identified. \u201cWe\u2019re in a big hole,\u201d said another.\n\nFor example, only 53.3 percent of Navy F/A-18 Super Hornets are rated \u201cmission-capable,\u201d meaning they are fit to fly, but even they may not be combat-ready, which requires a higher rating of \u201cfully mission-capable.\u201d And only last month, the number of F/A-18s available was below 50 percent.\n\n\u201cThose are horrific numbers, all of them,\u201d said John Venable, a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation who served 25 years in the Air Force. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge lift but it is about time they got the pressure.\n\n\u201cThe laissez-faire style of leadership is gone and that left with the Obama administration and the commanders that were associated with that. They weren\u2019t given the funds, they weren\u2019t given the certainty they needed to lead their forces. Well, now there is no excuses. These guys have the money, they have the personnel, they have the machinery,\u201d Venable said.\n\nLEARN FROM THE PROS: The Mattis memo orders the services to bring mission-capable rates for their F-35, F-22, F-16 and F/A-18 fleet above 80 percent by Oct. 15 of next year. \u201cI\u2019m just not sure that\u2019s possible,\u201d lamented one aviation officer. Mattis directed the services to take a page out of the private-sector playbook, and use the best practices of commercial aviation companies to improve readiness quickly. \u201cI am confident in our Department\u2019s ability to generate additional capacity from our current aircraft inventory, alongside the commercial aviation industry\u2019s sustainment of high availability rates,\u201d Mattis wrote in the Sept. 17 memo.\n\nThe Senate Armed Services Committee drilled down on the commercial industry\u2019s example during testimony by Air Force leaders on Wednesday. \u201cI did a little sniffing around, I think Delta Airlines, their aircraft readiness in their fleet is about 86 percent. I believe it\u2019s somewhere along those lines. Yet for the [Air Force] F-35 that\u2019s a new airplane, coming online, coming to the fleet, I think it\u2019s in the \u2026 mid-60s,\u201d Sen. Dan Sullivan, a subcommittee chairman, said while questioning Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson and Gen. David Goldfein, the Air Force chief of staff.\n\nLOW RATES: Sullivan\u2019s estimate for Air Force F-35 readiness turns out to be overly optimistic. The real rate is just over half, and slightly better than its cousin the F-22. The Air Force gave the following breakdown of its mission-capable rates, which it said was from fiscal 2017, the most recent year from which data were available, even though we know the rates are tracked almost daily:\n\nF-16C: 70.22%\n\nF-16D: 65.96%\n\nF-22A: 49.01%\n\nF-35A: 54.67%\n\nWilson told Sullivan that despite the overall low capability rate for the F-35, its readiness actually varies significantly from squadron to squadron. Supply lines and its stealth coding make the fifth-generation fighter, the most expensive weapons program in Pentagon history, more difficult to keep in the air than a Delta airliner, Wilson told Sullivan.\n\n\u201cObviously one of them is that the spare parts lines did not start up fast enough and that\u2019s something that predates all of us, but they were so focused on initial production they didn\u2019t start up and really work the logistics system fast enough,\u201d Wilson told senators. \u201cWe are putting together a plan with of course the Joint Program Office because this is a joint program, it is not an Air Force program, to get the supply line right so that our operational squadrons can meet the goals that the secretary of defense has set out for us.\u201d\n\nTOO MANY AIRPLANES: The Marine Corps appears to be in the worst shape. Heritage found about half of the service\u2019s tactical aircraft were considered flyable as of 2017. Unlike the other services, the Marines refused to release their current mission-capable rate citing \u201coperational security concerns.\u201d A spokesman said it would take a Freedom of Information Act request to get the numbers, but then he added, \u201cthe aviation fleet is healthier today than it has been since 2013.\u201d The Marines fly the legacy F/A-18 Hornet, not the Navy-only F/A-18E/F Super Hornet.\n\nGen. Robert Neller, the Marine Corps commandant, said the good news is the service has its annual funding from Congress and not a stopgap budget to hit Mattis\u2019 goal. \u201cHe told us we\u2019ve got a year, so OK. I mean, I know where we are right now,\u201d Neller said during a breakfast meeting with defense reporters. Part of that solution will be getting rid of the oldest Marine Corps F/A-18 jets \u201cto take advantage of the parts we can get off of them and reduce the number of airplanes,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve said we have too many airplanes, we\u2019ve got to get rid of airplanes. At some point when you get new you\u2019ve got to get rid of the old ones. You can\u2019t just keep them. Now, you\u2019ve got a squadron that\u2019s designed to maintain 12 airplanes and they\u2019ve got to maintain 16,\u201d Neller said.\n\nVenable warned that jettisoning jets to get capability rates up could amount to gaming the system. \u201cYou can lower your sights, reduce the number of commissioned aircraft you have, and therefore your numbers go up. I would never throw that rock at Neller but this is one of those things the secretary of defense should be looking at pretty hard,\u201d he said.\n\nGood Thursday morning and welcome to Jamie McIntyre\u2019s Daily on Defense, compiled by Washington Examiner National Security Senior Writer Jamie McIntyre (@jamiejmcintyre), National Security Writer Travis J.
