    "text": "A Brexit could have a very real impact on British people who live and work in Brussels.\n\nCCTV\u2019s Kate Parkinson met one Brit who is thinking about becoming Belgian. Follow Kate Parkinson on Twitter @katecctvnews\n\nAround 30,000 Brits live in Belgium. Edward Bray, a freelance journalist who has been living there for about 7 years, is anxiously watching what\u2019s happening at home.\n\n\u201cI have made my life here in Belgium and my partner is half Italian, half Greek, and so I see my future really as a citizen of the European Union. So if the U.K. were to leave, I don\u2019t know what that would mean in terms of my rights to work, for example, but also personal right, family rights and so on,\u201d Bray said. \u201cSo I\u2019m definitely asking a lot of questions about what that would mean for me, my family and for children in the future as well.\u201d\n\nIf the U.K. votes to leave the EU, Bray said he may become a Belgian citizen \u2014 a decision he\u2019s not taking lightly.\n\n\u201cFor me it\u2019s quite sad in a way because I feel quite strongly that I am British and I never thought it would come to that,\u201d Bray said. \u201cFor practical reasons, but also for some personal reasons, I\u2019ve felt strongly committed to the European Union, it\u2019s values, freedom to work in other places, freedom to travel, movement of goods and services. I feel quite strongly that these are freedoms that I subscribe to. And I wouldn\u2019t really like to leave the European Union as a citizen, myself, so if that meant becoming a Belgian citizen then yes I think it\u2019s something I\u2019d think strong and hard about. It\u2019s likely that I would also sign up to the list and become a Belgian citizen.\u201d\n\nThe list to become a Belgian citizen may be getting longer in the coming days. In the Brussels British expat bubble, there is a lot of chatter about what to do if a Brexit happens.\n\nJoseph Mariathasan discusses the Brexit vote\n\nFor more on the Brexit vote, CCTV America\u2019s Susan Roberts spoke to Joseph Mariathasan, a contributing editor at Investments & Pensions Europe. Mariathasan thinks a Brexit will introduce huge uncertainties in terms of the U.K.\u2019s economic future, the stability of the EU, continental European peace in the absence of the U.K. and of the U.K.\u2019s future position in the world.\n\nJoseph Mariathasan answers One More Question on the Brexit vote\n\nBrian Beary talks about the international impact of the Brexit\n\n\n\nFor the latest on the continental and global impact of the Brexit, CCTV America\u2019s Asieh Namdar spoke to Brian Beary, a freelance journalist based in Washington, D.C. He writes on international political relations, specializing in EU-U.S. affairs. He is a contributor and editorial advisor for European Affairs.",
