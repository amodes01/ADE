    "text": "The morning after citizens of Great Britain voted by a slight majority to leave the European Union, U.S. President Barack Obama was realistic about the motivations behind the so-called \u2018Brexit.\u2019\n\n\u201cI believe we are better off in a world where we are trading and networking and communicating,\u201d Obama said at the 2016 Global Entrepreneurship Summit held at Stanford University. \u201cBut that also means that cultures are colliding and sometimes it\u2019s disruptive and people get worried.\u201d\n\nObama, addressing a group of entrepreneurs and investors from around the world, tied Brexit into his remarks. He noted that the \u201cspecial relationship\u201d that the U.S. has with Britain, as well as the close economic ties with the European Union, will endure. But he also spoke to challenges.\n\n\u201cI do think that yesterday\u2019s vote raises challenges posed by globalization,\u201d Obama said. \u201cThe world has shrunk, it is interconnected. Many of you are catalyzing and accelerating it. It promises to bring extraordinary benefits, and evokes extraordinary fears.\u201d\n\nObama went on to hold an on-stage conversation with Facebook\u2019s billionaire CEO Mark Zuckerberg and three foreign entrepreneurs. He called such young people \u201cthe bridge, the glue\u201d that will help bring countries and culture together.",
