    "text": "A vote by the British to leave the European Union should not be viewed as an isolated incident. It should, instead, set off alarm bells about the future of the European project.\n\nBritish Prime Minister David Cameron\u2019s campaign to keep the United Kingdom in the EU was defeated by 52 percent to 48 percent despite overwhelming support from voters in Scotland, Northern Ireland, and London. The United Kingdom must now negotiate its exit from the EU under the terms of Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. These negotiations could last up to two years\u2014thereby creating a period of uncertainty for global financial markets and political sentiment on the European continent.\n\nPeter Westmacott, a former British ambassador to the United States, described the outcome of the so-called Brexit referendum on June 23 as an \u201cearthquake.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of work to do in the United Kingdom in terms of limiting the damage and restoring the confidence\u201d in the United Kingdom as being a good place to invest, he added.\n\n\n\nThe vote\u2019s repercussions will be felt across Europe, said Natalie Nougayrede, a columnist with the Guardian. \u201cIt would be a serious mistake to think that this is one isolated demonstration of rejection of the European project,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThere are forces at work on the continent that will benefit from this vote. They are already making that very, very clear,\u201d she added. The leaders of far-right, anti-immigrant political parties across Europe have been quick to welcome the outcome of the British vote.\n\nNougayrede and Westmacott spoke on a conference call hosted by the Atlantic Council on June 24. They were joined by Richard L. Morningstar, founding director and chairman of the Atlantic Council\u2019s Global Energy Center and a former US ambassador to the European Union. Claire Yorke, a nonresident senior fellow at the Council\u2019s Brent Scowcroft Center on International Security moderated the call.\n\nIf European leaders now say that they will continue with the European project, \u201cit simply won\u2019t do the trick,\u201d said Nougayrede. \u201cThere has to be a deep rethink, literally a rebuilding of the European project from ground up, not from top down.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt would be delusional to start thinking about deepening integration,\u201d she said.\n\nNoting that a concerted effort needs to be made to restore the connection between the European project and citizens across the European Union, she added: \u201cThis is going to be a very big task because we have been in denial for many years.\u201d\n\nMorningstar agreed. \u201cThis has to be a wake-up call to the EU,\u201d he said. \u201cAny idea of rushing into further integration, at this point anyway, is not going to help. The EU and Brussels have to work with the member states to develop more transparency, to develop more confidence among the citizenry of these states. But at the end of the day that is only going to happen if the EU comes up with the right policies and doesn\u2019t come across as overly technocratic and bureaucratic, and addresses some of the legitimate grievances that have come up as part of this debate.\u201d\n\nThe referendum\n\nThe outcome of the British referendum is \u201cpartly about a sense in the United Kingdom that the institutions of the European Union are not working properly, even though the United Kingdom is insulated from the effects of what is going on in Europe,\u201d said Westmacott.\n\nWestmacott said the Leave campaign had resorted to a campaign of misinformation, including baseless warnings about Turkey being on the brink of joining the EU, which would flood the United Kingdom with Turkish immigrants.\n\nThe vote was not along party lines; it was on geographical lines. Scotland voted 62 percent in favor of Remain, Wales voted 52.5 percent in favor of Leave, Northern Ireland voted 55.8 percent in favor of Remain, London voted 59.9 percent in favor of Remain, and the rest of England voted 57 percent in favor of Leave.\n\nThere was also a significant split between young and older voters. A majority of voters under the age of forty-nine were in favor of Remain with at least 75 percent under the age of twenty-four saying they had voted in favor of the United Kingdom remaining in the EU, according to a YouGov poll. A majority of older voters backed Leave.\n\nThe reaction among the youth is \u201chow could people be so irresponsible and dumb and misled by what they would regard as misinformation,\u201d said Westmacott. \u201cThis is not a generation which is wildly enamored with the concept of an ever closer union. This is just a hard-nosed generation who are struggling, quite often, to get jobs\u2026and they are pretty clear in their own mind that the economic and broader benefits of Britain as part of the European Union are very clear.\u201d\n\nWestmacott compared supporters of the Leave campaign to Americans who back Donald Trump, the US Republican Party\u2019s presumptive presidential nominee.\n\nThe referendum is as much about disillusionment with the political status quo and a continuing sense in the United States and in the United Kingdom that the hard-working, tax-paying middleclass are being ignored while those responsible for the global financial crisis in 2008 continue to prosper and have not been held accountable, said Westmacott.\n\n\u201cI very much hope that this doesn\u2019t prove to be the pulling of a thread on the old jumper. In other words, the unravelling of so much that European post-war construction has achieved,\u201d he added.\n\nThe \u2018special relationship\n\nThe United States and the United Kingdom share a \u201cspecial relationship.\u201d With the United Kingdom\u2019s decision to leave the EU, Washington will lose a friend at the negotiating table in Brussels.\n\nThe United States needs to rethink its approach to Europe, said Nougayrede. \u201cThere has been a certain diffidence [toward Europe from the United States].\u201d\n\n\u201cSaying Europe is a mess is just not enough,\u201d she added, noting that the United States should see the British referendum as a signal that it needs to find new ways to re-engage with Europe because the \u201ctraditional way of doing things was not sufficient.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, anti-Americanism is growing across Europe. In a sign of Washington\u2019s anxiety about a Brexit, US President Barack Obama uncharacteristically weighed in on the debate on a visit to London in April this year. That intervention was insufficient, and \u201cwe need to pause and think about why this didn\u2019t work\u2026and why official high-level messages may not be sufficient to keep Europe from dismantling this EU project,\u201d said Nougayrede.\n\nOn June 24, Obama expressed respect for the British voters\u2019 decision. \u201cThe special relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom is enduring, and the United Kingdom\u2019s membership in NATO remains a vital cornerstone of US foreign, security, and economic policy,\u201d the president said. \u201cThe United Kingdom and the European Union will remain indispensable partners of the United States even as they begin negotiating their ongoing relationship to ensure continued stability, security, and prosperity for Europe, Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and the world.\u201d\n\nThe United States and the United Kingdom are always going to have a special relationship, the question is how effective will it be in the future and will the United Kingdom become isolated on foreign policy, said Morningstar.\n\n\u201cEurope is our strongest partner in dealing with global issues\u2026and Britain has been such a staunch ally working with us even within the EU to come up with policies that are coordinated and consistent, and Britain just won\u2019t be part of that, certainly not as an insider,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt is really important that Britain not withdraw into a shell,\u201d he added.\n\nWestmacott said the United Kingdom\u2019s commitment to NATO to spend two percent of its GDP on defense, its commitment to nuclear deterrence, and the close cooperation between US and British agencies and armed services will be unaffected by a Brexit.\n\nThe road ahead\n\nOne of the biggest challenges that lie ahead will be how to manage the political and economic uncertainty as the United Kingdom sails into uncharted waters.\n\nWhile there will be no immediate change in the United Kingdom\u2019s relationships, there will be a drop off in investments in the country and businesses will move out to ensure that they can be part of the single market, said Morningstar.\n\nWith regard to the negotiations with Brussels, Morningstar wondered how the EU would react. \u201cHow accommodating will the EU be to Britain?\u201d he said. \u201cIf Britain has problems and [a Brexit] is shown to have been mistake that could help mitigate the domino effect with respect to other countries.\u201d\n\nAshish Kumar Sen is deputy director, editorial, at the Atlantic Council.
