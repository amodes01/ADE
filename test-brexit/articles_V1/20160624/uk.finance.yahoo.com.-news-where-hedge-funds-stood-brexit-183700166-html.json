    "text": "Hedge funds around the world were divided on the prospects of a U.K. vote to leave the European Union, putting millions of dollars at stake on bets on both sides.\n\nThe surprise \u201cleave\u201d vote roiled the financial world Friday, battering the British pound and sinking stock markets in Europe, the U.S. and Asia amid a bracing for an uncertain future. Hedge funds in the U.K., which manage about $400 billion and generally are tight-lipped, were unusually vocal on both sides of the Brexit debate in the lead-up to Thursday's referendum.\n\nMichael Farmer, co-founder of RK Capital Management and who donated \u00a3200,000 to the pro-\u201cBrexit\u201d campaign, had predicted that a \u201cstay\u201d vote would cast a \u201cgray cloud of depression\u201d over the country.\n\nAndrew Law, the chairman and chief executive of Caxton Associates LP who had donated the same amount to the other side, said \u201cthe risks of tearing up this trading relationship would be horrific.\u201d The New York-based fund with a London office made bets against the pound this year, pointing to volatility in the currency market.\n\nIn addition to Mr. Law, the \u201cremain\u201d camp included David Harding of Winton Capital Management, Manny Roman of Man Group PLC, one of the world\u2019s biggest hedge-fund firms, and Ewan Kirk of Cantab Capital Partners. Crispin Odey of Odey Asset Management, Paul Marshall of Marshall Wace and Savvas Savouri of Toscafund Asset Management LLP were among the investors pushing for an exit.\n\nRegardless of their public stances, some hedge-funds are likely to profit on the market turmoil.\n\nGeorge Soros earlier this month expressed confidence that as the vote neared, the remain camp would strengthen. Later, in a column for the Guardian, the 85-year-old billionaire investor warned a vote to leave the EU would devalue the pound by more than 15% or possibly even 20%. Soros Fund Management LLC, which manages $30 billion for Mr.Soros and his family, recently sold stocks and bought gold and shares of gold miners in anticipation of global market turmoil. (Years ago, Mr. Soros bet against the British pound in a trade that ultimately earned $1 billion of profits.)\n\nAnne-Sophie D\u2019Andlau, co-founder of Paris-based hedge fund firm CIAM, said a Brexit would create \u201creal turmoil\u201d and bought put options -- the right to sell at a predetermined price -- to protect part of her portfolio.",
