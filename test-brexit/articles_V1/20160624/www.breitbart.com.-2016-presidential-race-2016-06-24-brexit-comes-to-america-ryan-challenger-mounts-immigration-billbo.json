    "text": "Following last night\u2019s historic Brexit vote, House Speaker Paul Ryan\u2019s primary challenger, Wisconsin businessman Paul Nehlen, seems to have taken a page from the playbook of the U.K. Independence Party (UKIP) with the launch of a new billboard campaign.\n\nOn Friday morning, Nehlen\u2019s campaign went live with a new billboard in Ryan\u2019s hometown of Janesville, Wisconsin that is reminiscent of the distinctive UKIP-style campaign.\n\nThe ad reads: \u201cRadical Islam Kills Americans. Vote YES for Immigration Control. Vote NO for Paul Ryan.\u201d\n\nThe billboard then directs viewers to Nehlen\u2019s campaign website, ElectNehlen.com.\n\nUKIP\u2019s national billboard campaign is distinctive for its clear, straight-forward manner of describing the effects of large-scale migration and its impact on workers and Western culture.\n\n\u201cThis is the first of many billboards our campaign will be launching to inform the voters about what\u2019s at stake on August 9th,\u201d Nehlen told Breitbart.\n\nAs Nehlen\u2019s billboard suggests, Paul Ryan has a two-decade long history of pushing for open border immigration policies \u2013 including his 2015 effort to fund President Obama\u2019s expansion to the U.S. refugee resettlement operation.\n\nIn speeches, Ryan has made the case for policies that would effectively dissolve U.S. borders \u2014 declaring that the U.S. \u201cis more than [its] borders.\u201d Ryan has even articulated his support for implementing an immigration system similar to the open borders policy of the European Union \u2014 calling for \u201can economic-based immigration system where\u2026 labor and supply can meet each other so we can help fuel our economy and create jobs.\u201d\n\nThe phrase \u201clabor supply and demand can meet each other,\u201d is a centerpiece of open borders thought. Under this global, one-world theory, any willing employer should be able to hire any willing worker regardless of what country he or she lives in. This view, that America is an \u201cidea\u201d and not a \u201cnation,\u201d sees borders as an obstacle to commerce.\n\nWith regards to Islamic migration, Ryan\u2019s controversial omnibus spending bill funded U.S. visas for nearly 300,000 (permanent and temporary) Muslim migrants in a single year.\n\nWhile polling data shows that the Republican electorate overwhelmingly backs proposals to temporarily pause Muslim migration, Ryan has rejected such proposals.\n\nHe has repeatedly ruled out the possibility of making any cuts to Muslim migration\u2014 insisting that \u201cthat\u2019s not who we are,\u201d and that such a proposal is \u201cnot reflective of our principles.\u201d\n\nHowever, Ryan has not explained how importing hundreds of thousands of migrants from nations that hold sentiments that are anti-women, anti-gay, anti-religious tolerance, and anti-America benefits the United States or helps to protect our Western values.\n\nIndeed, as a result of large-scale Muslim migration, the U.S. has imported several practices and values that are antithetical to Western principles.\n\nFor instance, Muslim migration has put half a million U.S. girls and women at risk of suffering the barbaric and misogynistic practice of Female Genital Mutilation, according to Equality Now.\n\nAayan Hirsi Ali has also observed that Islamic \u201chonor violence\u201d has become increasingly prevalent in the United States as a result of \u201ca significant increase in the number of people moving to the United States from countries with high-honor violence rates \u2014notably Somalia\u2026 as well as Iraq.\u201d\n\nA 2011 study by the Tahirih Justice Center titled, \u201cForced Marriage in Immigrant Communities in the United States\u201d found that in the U.S. there are \u201cas many as 3,000 known or suspected cases of [forced marriage],\u201d identified by survey respondents in recent years.\n\nThe high rate of Islamic migration has also posed challenges to national security. As CBS has reported, \u201cThe Cedar-Riverside neighborhood of Minneapolis [which] is sometimes called \u2018Little Mogadishu\u2019\u201d given that it is the \u201ccenter of the nation\u2019s largest concentration of Somalis,\u201d has become a \u201cfertile ground for Islamic terrorist groups recruiting new fighters.\u201d\n\nAs the Minneapolis Star Tribune has reported, a Congressional report found that \u201cMinnesota leads the nation in would-be ISIL terrorists from U.S.\u201d\n\nMoreover, evidence has shown that the recent Orlando terrorist attack, in which the son of Afghan migrants targeted the LGBT community and slaughtered 49 people in a gay nightclub, was motivated by anti-Western ideology that was imported from foreign nations rather than \u201chomegrown.\u201d\n\nAs Andrew McCarthy has explained, \u201cThe inspiration for Muslims to brutalize and mass murder gay people does not come from ISIS. It is deeply rooted in Islamic law, affirmed by many of Islam\u2019s most renowned scholars.\u201d\n\nMcCarthy explains that \u201cthe mandate that homosexuals be killed\u201d comes from Sharia \u2013 not ISIS. \u201cThis is why, wherever sharia is the law, homosexuals are persecuted and killed,\u201d McCarthy writes. \u201c[With the Orlando terror attack] we have gotten another glimpse of radicalization, which is not \u201chomegrown\u201d but rather fueled by a foreign, anti-American, anti-liberty ideology.\u201d\n\nAccording to Pew, nearly all Muslims in Afghanistan (99 percent) support sharia law as official law. Between 2001 and 2014, the U.S. permanently resettled more than 40,000 migrants from Afghanistan on green cards.\n\nAdditionally, between 2001 and 2014, the U.S. permanently resettled 674,920 migrants from nations where gays can be executed, according to data from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).\n\nThis figure does not include the total number of migrants the U.S. has permanently resettled from Muslim nations during that time, which is nearly 1.7 million.\n\nThe current rate of U.S. immigration is record high. Every day the U.S. admits enough net immigrants to fill an overcrowded, metropolitan high school. Every month the U.S. imports a population of immigrants that is larger than the occupancy of Lambeau Field, where the Green Bay Packers play.\n\nSince Wisconsin voters sent Paul Ryan to Washington, the U.S. has imported a population of immigrants that is nearly three times larger than the entire population of Wisconsin.\n\nIn seven years time \u2013 unless Congress takes action to curb U.S. visa distributions \u2013 the foreign-born share of the U.S. population will reach an all-time high. In the 1920s, the last time the foreign-born share of the population reached a record high, then-President Calvin Coolidge hit the pause button for roughly fifty years, producing an era of explosive wage growth and allowing immigrants already in the country to assimilate.\n\nPaul Ryan, however, has made clear that he does not wish to curb immigration, but instead has pushed legislation that would substantially increase immigration.\n\nAccording to Pew polling data, 92 percent of the GOP electorate \u2014 and 83 percent of the American electorate as a whole \u2014 is opposed to such an agenda and wants to see immigration levels frozen or reduced. Ryan represents only a minuscule seven percent of the GOP electorate that wants to increase migration rates.\n\nAs NumbersUSA president Roy Beck has explained, \u201cOpen borders is in his [Paul Ryan\u2019s] ideological DNA \u2026 He\u2019s an ideologue and has spent his whole life working for ideologues. Open borders seeps out of every pore of his being \u2026 Ryan is the heart and soul of crony capitalism.\u201d",
