    "text": "The Brexit vote sent shock waves around the world, creating confusion as leaders in Kenya, the US and other countries reacted cautiously. State House Spokesperson Manoah Esipisu said the President had been briefed on the outcome of the vote but declined to give his views on the outcome.\n\n\u201cIt is democracy, the British have made their choice. The President has been sufficiently briefed and officials continue to study the impact of the vote,\u201d Mr Esipisu said.\n\nThe White House said in a statement that President Barack Obama was being briefed on the UK referendum, and he will continue to be updated by his team \u201cas the situation warrants.\u201d\n\nThe White House statement read: \u201cWe expect the president will have an opportunity to speak to Prime Minister Cameron over the course of the next day, and we will release further comment as soon as appropriate.\u201d\n\nShocked markets\n\nThe decision by Britain to exit the EU has shocked global markets and sent the pound tanking to the lowest level in 31 years. President Obama had encouraged Britain to remain in the EU but said the decision was up to voters.\n\nThe UK has been one of the most stable economies in the EU bloc, which has been funding numerous projects in Africa, like the African Union Mission in Somalia and trade through the European Development Fund. Following Prime Minister David Cameron\u2019s resignation yesterday, his planned State visit to Kenya next month might not materialise.\n\n\u201cI do not comment on the Prime Minister\u2019s diary but the relationship between Kenya and the UK will not be affected by the vote,\u201d said the UK High Commissioner to Kenya Nic Hailey. According to Kenya\u2019s Ambassador to Belgium and the EU Johnson Weru, Kenya stands to gain in terms of bilateral engagements. \u201cWe may gain from this exit in a minimal way. But in the fullness of time, what will give us direction is legislation that will be developed to give effect to the referendum,\u201d Mr Weru told The Standard on Saturday from Belgium.\n\nWeru acknowledged the instance developments with the Britons vote at the referendum, arguing that Norway and Switzerland are not full members of the EU but they somehow relate with decisions they think are good.\n\n\u201cFor instance, if you have a Schengen Visa, you can enter Switzerland, which is not a member of Schengen. But when doing money transfer, you cannot transfer money directly to Switzerland because the country is not a member of the European monitory system,\u201d said Weru.\n\nOn Cameron\u2019s announced State visit to Kenya, Weru says it may not be possible. \u201cI do not see it happening. It will be better for the future so that whoever picks up the political leadership of the UK, comes with greater strength, in terms of concluding bilateral agreements instead of being signed by third parties,\u201d he said.\n\nWeru, who also represents Kenya\u2019s national interests, in partnership with other member states of the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) Group of States, noted that the impact of the exit will be on the banking industry. He nevertheless stressed that, \u201cThe world is governed by rules and these rules are clear on the implementation framework.\n\nWe have two years of transition, which will allow everybody to bring their pieces on board.\u201d The ambassador argues that for now, except for the immediate reaction of investment and the money markets, Kenya and the African continent agreement is intact, save for signing of power agreements. \u201cWe will keep the doors open for the next two years. In the meantime, we will wait to hear from the UK regarding critical decisions on where it wants to go, in terms of common international instruments like standards and banking,\u201d said Weru.\n\nEU standards\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is not unlikely that it will change the EU standards. Whatever is good for them, will be good for us. The International community has been challenged to scale up its development support and finances to the developing nations. President Kenyatta recently expressed concern that third world countries continue to get a raw deal, despite various trade agreements signed with the EU, which remains a major trade block. Addressing representatives of ACP at a meeting in Brussels, Belgium, Uhuru attributed the poor trading levels to conditionalities and other bureaucratic requirements put by the EU.\n\nHe faulted the current ACP regime of doing nothing to avert this situation. \u201cOn the trade front, it is apparent that the current regime has not met the expectations in ACP countries.\n\nThe impact of the development cooperation efforts with the EU has been limited despite the elaborate mechanisms in place,\u201d said the president.",
