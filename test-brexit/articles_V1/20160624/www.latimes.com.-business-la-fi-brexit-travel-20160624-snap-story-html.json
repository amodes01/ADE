    "text": "People ride on a fairground ride with the London Eye and Big Ben as a backdrop as the sun sets in London in September 2013.\n\nDemand for travel was already strong in the U.S., and the vote by the U.K. to leave the European Union will make it cheaper for Americans to visit their British cousins across the pond.\n\nThe exit of the United Kingdom from the 28-nation union has pushed the value of the British pound down relative to the U.S. dollar, making it likely that more U.S. travelers will visit Britain to take advantage of the disparity.\n\nOn Friday morning, the pound to dollar exchange dropped 7.44% to $1.3766, the lowest level in decades. Data from the metasearch travel site Liligo.com shows that searches from throughout the world for flights to Britain began to rise Thursday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut beyond that travel incentive, the vote, referred to as \u201cBrexit,\u201d has created mostly uncertainty in the travel industry.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s too early to predict what impact it will have on tourism,\u201d said Jonathan Grella, executive vice president for public affairs at the U.S. Travel Assn., which promotes travel in the U.S.\n\nIn the short term, travel between Europe and the U.K. is not expected to change, at least until the breakup is formally negotiated over the next two years or so, travel experts say. More than 117 million people traveled by air between the U.K. and the rest of the EU in 2015.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe Brexit vote has triggered much uncertainty \u2014 financial and otherwise,\u201d said Tony Tyler, director general and chief executive of International Air Transport Assn., the trade group for the world\u2019s airlines. \u201cAs leaders in the U.K. and the EU work to establish a new framework for their relationship, one certainty to guide them is the need and desire of people on both sides of that relationship to travel and trade.\u201d\n\nBut David Scowsill, president and chief executive of the World Travel & Tourism Council, a nonprofit forum for the world\u2019s travel industry, said he expects that travel and tourism will remain strong over the long run.\n\n\u201cWe know that our sector is resilient and we expect business and leisure travel to hold up in the face of these challenges,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOver the past year, Britain has enjoyed a surge in international visitors, especially from the U.S. and Canada.\n\nIn the 12 months leading up to April, the number of visits to the U.K. was 5% higher than the same period a year earlier. The number of visitors who came from North America rose by 11% and jumped 4% from Europe, according to the Office of National Statistics in the U.K.\n\nMeanwhile, the United Kingdom has been a huge source of tourism for the U.S.\n\nThe U.K. was the third largest source of international visitors to the U.S. in 2015, behind only Canada and Mexico, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce.\n\nLast year, 4.9 million visitors traveled from the U.K. to the U.S., an 18% increase from the previous year. The only other countries with a bigger surge in visitors to the U.S. last year were South Korea, with a 20% increase, and China, with an 18.3% increase, Department of Commerce data show.\n\nUPDATES:\n\n11:46 a.m.: This article was updated with figures on recent travel by British visitors to the U.S.\n\nThis article was originally published at 11:15 a.m.",
