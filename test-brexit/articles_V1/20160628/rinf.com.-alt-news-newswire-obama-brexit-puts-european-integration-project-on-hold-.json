    "text": "Britain\u2019s decision to leave the EU has paused the project of full European integration, but will not cause \u201cmajor cataclysmic changes,\u201d US President Barack Obama said.\n\nBrexit has led to an over-reaction across the globe, Obama told National Public Radio on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a little bit of hysteria post-Brexit vote, as if somehow NATO\u2019s gone, the trans-Atlantic alliance is dissolving, and every country is rushing off to its own corner. That\u2019s not what\u2019s happening,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that he wouldn\u2019t \u201coverstate\u201d this hysteria.\n\n\u201cI think that the best way to think about this is, a pause button has been pressed on the project of full European integration.\u201d\n\nObama said the vote was largely a reaction to the EU \u201cprobably moving faster and without as much consensus as it should have.\u201d \u2014 NPR (@NPR) June 28, 2016\n\nThe US leader pointed at Norway, which is not an EU member but remains on friendly terms with the union.\n\n\u201cIf over the course of what is going to be at least a two-year negotiation between England and Europe, Great Britain ends up being affiliated to Europe like Norway is, the average person is not going to notice a big change.\u201c\n\n\u201cI think this will be a moment when all of Europe says, \u2018Let\u2019s take a breath and let\u2019s figure out how do we maintain some of our national identities, how do we preserve the benefits of integration, and how do we deal with some of the frustrations that our own voters are feeling\u2019,\u201d Obama said, adding he does not anticipate \u201cmajor cataclysmic changes as a consequence of this.\u201d\n\nThe UK\u2019s unprecedented decision to leave the EU has caused a furor across the world, with stocks plunging amid financial and political uncertainty. On June 23, at least 51.9 percent voted to leave the union.\n\nREAD MORE: European markets rebound after two days of heavy losses\n\nOn Thursday June 23, 51.9 percent of Britons voted to leave the union, sparking turmoil in the UK and elsewhere.\n\nFriday saw London\u2019s FTSE index lose $164 billion in the space of 10 minutes of trading, and on Monday the British pound plunged to its lowest level in almost 31 years.\n\nREAD MORE: Scottish leader could ask local parliament to block UK exit from EU\n\nInternational rating agencies Fitch, Moody\u2019s and Standard and Poor\u2019s all downgraded Britain following the country\u2019s vote to leave the EU.\n\nAt the same time, Scotland has been strongly hinting at vetoing the referendum result, while London Mayor Sadiq Khan has demanded more autonomy for the capital. Khan\u2019s statement came after a petition to make London an independent city-state attracted 175,000 signatures.\n\nREAD MORE: Ice-Exit! Internet reacts to England\u2019s shock defeat in Euro 2016 in typically taunting fashion\n\nIn the EU, Brexit inspired politicians and activists to ponder similar initiatives. French National Front leader Marine Le Pen called for a referendum on leaving the EU, although her initiative was rejected by President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande.\n\nIn Finland over 10,000 people have already signed a freshly launched petition to hold a \u2018Fixit\u2019 referendum. Dutch anti-immigration politician Geert Wilders said the Netherlands had the right to a \u2018Nexit\u2019 vote, while across the Atlantic people in the US state of Texas have starting pushing for a \u2013 a Texas split from the USA \u2013 on social media.",
