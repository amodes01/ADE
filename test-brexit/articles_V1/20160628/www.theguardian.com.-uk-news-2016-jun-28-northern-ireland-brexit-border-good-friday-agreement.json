    "text": "American diplomats who helped broker the Northern Ireland peace process have condemned the UK\u2019s vote to quit the European Union and described the prospect of a hard border with the Republic of Ireland as \u201chorrendous\u201d.\n\n\n\nThe US was one of the main guarantors of the April 1998 Good Friday agreement and can point to the subsequent decline in sectarian violence as a signature foreign policy success in recent times.\n\nBut last week\u2019s Brexit decision cast a shadow over the only part of the UK that shares a land border with the EU. A majority of people in Northern Ireland voted to remain, a result that could potentially reopen old wounds. Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s Martin McGuinness, the deputy first minister, called for a poll on Irish reunification, while experts warned that a physical border with the Republic would almost certainly have to be reconstituted.\n\nView image in fullscreen Northern Ireland. Photograph: Mapbox, OpenStreetMap\n\nBruce Morrison, a former US congressman credited with recruiting President Bill Clinton to the peace process, said on Monday: \u201cI think overall it\u2019s a terrible decision for the EU, the west and Europe. It\u2019s stampeding backwards. There\u2019s nothing, in my view, good to say about the decision, but we\u2019ll make the best of it.\u201d\n\nThe Good Friday agreement is not in immediate jeopardy, he insisted, but Northern Ireland will miss the billions of pounds it receives in EU funding. \u201cI don\u2019t think that it\u2019s going to unravel the agreement, but I think it takes away a level of support for the peace process and for the Northern Ireland that exists in the European Union, where a substantial amount of investment to assist Northern Ireland has occurred. So that\u2019s definitely going to be undercut, if not fully eliminated,\u201d Morrison said.\n\nMorrison urged politicians to retain the free, near seamless passage that people currently enjoy between north and south. The border checks of the Troubles have been described as \u201cmilitarised sites of fear and oppression\u201d and a renewed border could be psychologically damaging after decades of effort to promote peace and reconciliation.\n\n\u201cA hard border would be a horrendous result and I would think that sensible people in London and in Dublin would work to prevent a hard border,\u201d he said. \u201cI think there are ways to have a soft border even though the EU no longer covers both parts of Ireland.\u201d\n\nA member of Congress from Connecticut from 1983 to 1991, Morrison helped secure a US visa for Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s Gerry Adams, enabling negotiations that culminated in the Good Friday agreement and a sharp reduction in \u2013 though not total eradication of \u2013 sectarian attacks. Under the peace deal, the secretary of state can call a border poll when there is clear evidence that public opinion has shifted towards a united Ireland.\n\n\u201cI think the political circumstances are going to unravel in ways that are yet to be seen,\u201d he continued. \u201cObviously, if Scotland carries through with a new referendum and it comes out the other way, that is going to destabilise the United Kingdom for sure, and the role of Northern Ireland in the UK will become more uncertain. In the process of that happening, there will certainly be advocacy for a joining of Northern Ireland with the Republic of Ireland through some kind of border poll.\u201d\n\nMorrison endorsed the current Northern Ireland secretary Theresa Villiers\u2019 view that there is not majority support for such a poll, but warned that a decline in investment from a distracted Britain could add fuel to the fire.\n\n\u201cAll of that is going to be unsettled and it encourages people to strain the relationship between nationalists and unionists prematurely. Sooner or later things are going to change in Northern Ireland, probably on the constitutional question, but right now the work is about building bridges between the two communities, and this doesn\u2019t necessarily advance that,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nHowever, Morrison, who has Irish ancestry and earlier this year received a peace building award from the Irish president, refused to be pessimistic. \u201cI think the doomsayers about the peace process are undervaluing the amount of progress that has been made, and I don\u2019t think the politicians in the north are just going to lightly throw it away, although there will probably be debates that will be more contentious than they might have been in other circumstances.\u201d\n\nBrexit was firmly opposed by former senator George Mitchell, who as US special envoy chaired the negotiations that led to the 1998 peace deal. Speaking at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington in April, he said a UK departure from the EU would be \u201charmful\u201d to Northern Ireland.\n\nAmong the reasons he gave was the high probability of another Scottish referendum for independence. \u201cTo me, I\u2019m not from Northern Ireland, but knowing the people there well, and knowing many people in Scotland, to think that Northern Ireland and Scotland would be in different countries is simply so inconsistent with their whole history which continues to this day,\u201d Mitchell said.\n\nView image in fullscreen Health minister Michelle O\u2019Neill, Sinn F\u00e9in leader Gerry Adams, deputy first minister Martin McGuinness and MEP Martina Anderson at Stormont Castle in Belfast, as Adams gives his reaction to the Brexit vote.

As the Good Friday agreement shows, the United States has enormous diplomatic, economic and other tools that can be used in a positive and constructive way and I think this is another occasion on which they may be needed.\u201d\n\nBut Mick Mulvaney, a Republican from South Carolina, took a different view. \u201cUltimately this is going to be a decision for the Irish and the Northern Irish,\u201d he said. \u201cThe United States government\u2019s going to have almost zero to do with it. We\u2019ll just continue to watch it as curious observers from across the ocean.\u201d",
