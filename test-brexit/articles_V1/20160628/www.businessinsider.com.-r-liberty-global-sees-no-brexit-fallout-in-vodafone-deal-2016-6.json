UK is a relatively large part of our business and in the end British consumers will still want the same products and services.\"\n\nMeanwhile, EU regulators are to rule by July 19 on the agreement between Liberty Global and Vodafone to merge their Dutch operations and forge the No.2 telecoms provider in the Netherlands after incumbent KPN .\n\n(Reporting by Adrian Krajewski; Editing by Marcin Goclowski)",
