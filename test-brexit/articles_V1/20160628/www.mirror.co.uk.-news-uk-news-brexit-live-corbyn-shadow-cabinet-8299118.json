    "text": "17:16\n\nAlastair Campbell: \"We are becoming a laughing stock\"\n\nLabour\u2019s Alastair Campbell has had a passionate rant about Jeremy Corbyn and the future of the Labour party on BBC News\n\nHe said: \u201cWe are becoming a laughing stock. The Labour party is becoming a laughing stock. The country is becoming a laughing stock because of the lack of leadership that\u2019s being shown in so many different places.\n\n\u201cAnd what it says to me is that he\u2019s decided to put his own vanity ahead of the possibility of the party that he claims to love being utterly wiped out at an election that could be weeks, months away.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cHe got the mandate. He was elected leader with a massive majority. Correct. Does he have the ability to lead? That is a bigger question, I\u2019m afraid. And sometimes leadership is about being honest with yourself. Can I do this job?\n\nImage: Paul Chappells) Paul Chappells)\n\n\u201cHe cannot do the job.\u201d The former New Labour spin doctor went on: \u201cHis supporters are saying it\u2019s all orchestrated, it\u2019s a coup, blah blah blah. These people who have been resigning over the last few days. Some of them I know, some of them I don\u2019t know. They have seen close up - they have tried to make it work. They know it cannot work.\n\n\u201cAnd they\u2019ve also seen that this new politics he\u2019s talking about - I believe in a lot of the things Jeremy Corbyn says. I believe in trying to deal with division and inequality in society. I believe in trying to make the world a fairer place. Where\u2019s the policy coming from? Where\u2019s the leadership on policy coming from? Where is the arguments, other than doing what he did last night? Going to speak to the converted.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if you saw that documentary, that Vice film. Half an hour of going from hall to hall, telling the converted what they think. Did you ever see him going out to talk to small businesses about what they\u2019re trying to do? \u201cDo you ever see him trying to reach out to new support and trying to get it? We\u2019re going to get wiped out if he stays on as leader.\u201d",
