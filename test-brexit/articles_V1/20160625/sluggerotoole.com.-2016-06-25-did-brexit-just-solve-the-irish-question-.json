    "text": "What\u2019s done isn\u2019t quite done.\n\nWhat, for example, are the terms of BrExit exit?\n\nAnd how will they be agreed?\n\nBrookings Fellow Tom Wright asks, \u201cIf it is right and proper for the people to have a say on EU membership, shouldn\u2019t they also have a say on the outcome of the negotiations to determine whether they are what the Leave campaign promised?\u201d\n\nWhat terms should Northern Ireland\u2019s leaders now be seeking?\n\nSimple: Northern Ireland must stay within the EU and the UK.\n\nNorthern Ireland and Scotland can and must make common cause on this objective immediately.\n\nThe nature of the U.K. demands change in order to be saved.\n\nFor Scottish nationalists, this represents the smart play.\n\nThe SNP, even now, can\u2019t be complacent about winning a second Scottish independence referendum \u2013 should they secure one. But a Scotland that shares a union with Europe, while remaining within a looser U.K., is one that can be remake on solid foundations; Uniquely Scottish but anchored in the realities of local and international interdependence, not fantasies about standing alone in the modern world.\n\nFor English Nationalists \u2013 and that\u2019s clearly what the BrExiters overwhelmingly are \u2013 well, they\u2019ve asked for this.\n\nHaving demanded and won \u201cnational\u201d independence and the end of a union that supposedly impeded and diluted it, will they dare deny the Scottish people the same right?\n\nAnd what about the Irish, north and south, green and orange?\n\nTo most people living in Northern Ireland not named Arlene Foster and Martin McGuiness, like those studying its conflict from afar, it\u2019s long been clear that the only \u201csolution\u201d would be some sort of rolling constitutional fudge.\n\nSince \u201cconstitutional fudge\u201d has been the trending Google search in civil service departments across the capitals of Europe since June 24th, today all of Ireland is presented with a unique opportunity amid the chaos.\n\nNorthern Ireland\u2019s future has always required a grey area between London and Dublin where both identities can coexist.\n\nAs with post-BrExit Scotland, a Northern Ireland that shares European Union membership with the Republic of Ireland, and a union with the rest of the U.K., makes sense.\n\nThis is not the independent stand-alone Irish Republic envisioned by De Valera. No, this would be much more sensible and sustainable and than that fantasy.\n\nThis would be a stronger Ireland than ever.\n\nAn island without an internal border; two cooperative political entities sharing a outward face to the world, part-British, part-Irish, entirely European.\n\nPre-BrExit, Belfast\u2019s hardline British Democratic Unionist party has championed the adoption of a corporate tax rate in harmony not with London but Dublin. Post-BrExit, the logic of this position makes the case for Belfast remaining in the U.K and in the E.U., especially if the north\u2019s Scottish cousins lead the way.\n\nFor Belfast\u2019s Irish nationalists, the opportunity is greater still. Since 1998\u2019s Belfast Agreement, they\u2019ve been in search of a question to answer and a problem to solve.\n\nThe once strong SDLP spent years arguing that \u201cnorth south makes sense\u201d but failing to explain why, or even what that meant.\n\nPost-BrExit, it\u2019s abundantly clear that a hard land border between Northern Ireland and the world\u2019s largest trading bloc in the world is utterly senseless. It\u2019s also rather dangerous.\n\nBrExit has changed everything. But the terms of that change are up for grabs.\n\nWe can\u2019t go backwards but for Northern Ireland, the past is best left there anyway.\n\nNorthern Ireland in the U.K and in the E.U. is a place everyone can accept.\n\nIt can be a model of sober, self-confident interdependence at a time the U.K., the E.U and the world urgently needs one.\n\nStrategic Communications Consultant, located in Washington, D.C.",
