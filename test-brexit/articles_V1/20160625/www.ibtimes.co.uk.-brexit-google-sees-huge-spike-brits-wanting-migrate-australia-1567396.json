    "text": "While uncertainty lingers over the UK's future following the historic Brexit decision, more and more British people are looking as far afield as Australia in search of a better life.\n\nGoogle saw a huge increase in the number of people searching for 'immigration to Australia' after the shock announcement that the majority of Britons voted to leave the EU, (51.9 per cent compared to 48.1 per cent wanting to stay).\n\nWhile politicians call for stability amid economic turmoil, many Brits are seeing the prospect of living Down Under as a positive alternative.\n\n\"The grass does look greener on the other side at the moment,\" Professor Glenn Withers, an Immigration expert from Australian National University told Mail Online. \"The disdain in the UK has driven people to think about other options.\"\n\nAccording to Google Analytics data, the number of times people looked for migration to Australia soared in the lead up to the referendum. It peaked at 6.30pm AEST on Friday, when it was announced that Leave was on its way to victory after gaining large margins across northern England and Wales.\n\nProfessor Withers said British nationals were still eligible to apply to migrate to Australia despite the Brexit decision and would enhance Australia's economy.\n\n\"The Brits have traditionally settled well here and in uncertain times a steady flow of immigrants would keep the economy growing.\"\n\nIt would be an ironic swipe to Boris Johnson who wants to take back control of our borders if people left the UK for Australia and also after he campaigned that he wanted to make it easier for non-EU migrants to study and work in the UK if it left the EU.\n\nCurrently the UK's migration policy discriminates against skilled workers from outside the EU including places like Australia.\n\nIt will be likely now the UK will have to negotiate a separate trade deal with Australia and the US including renegotiating its trade and political ties with the remaining 27 member states.\n\nSince the seismic turn of events this week there have been calls for referendums by right-wing groups in France, Italy, the Netherlands and Denmark.",
