Just hours after deciding to leave EU in a historic vote which has pushed the British Pound to the netherworld, caused a mega-collapse in stock markets around the world and pushed gold and silver prices to a new highs, the Britishers seem to have woken from the euphoria surrounding the vote.\n\nAccording to Google Trends, just hours after the EU vote, United Kingdom citizens are searching what exactly is EU on Google. Surprising as it may seem, it was after the polls closed when British voters started to think seriously about the implications of their choice.\n\n\"What is the EU?\" is the second top UK question on the EU since the #EURefResults were officially announced pic.twitter.com/1q4VAX3qcm \u2014 GoogleTrends (@GoogleTrends) June 24, 2016\n\nAccording to data from Google Trends, the searches for \u201cwhat is the eu\u201d and \u201cwhat is brexit\u201d started climbing across Britain late into the night. The polls closed at 10 p.m. local time.\n\nIt also seems that Britishers voted in the remain/leave referendum sans any researcher or decision because another top query on Google search was \u201cWhat happens if we leave the EU?\u201d The search spike seems to suggest that UK voters weren\u2019t exactly sure what they were getting into.\n\nNorthern Ireland and Scotland voters fare equally to their English counterparts on the dumb quotient. Google Trends, on Twitter, has highlighted a few local spikes, too, with \u201cwhat is Brexit\u201d a top search related to the referendum in both Northern Ireland and Scotland. Both of them voted in favor of remaining in the EU.\n\n\"What will happen if we leave the EU?\" Top questions on the #EUref in Northern Ireland since first results announced pic.twitter.com/VKmbRrZoPZ \u2014 GoogleTrends (@GoogleTrends) June 24, 2016\n\n\"What happens if we leave the EU?\" Top questions on #EUref in Scotland since polls closed pic.twitter.com/ngOsEOPDXZ \u2014 GoogleTrends (@GoogleTrends) June 24, 2016\n\nWhile some from London who were against the leave are now searching future residency options by googling for \u201cmove to Gibraltar.\u201d (Gibraltar is a British territory in southern Europe.)\n\n+680% spike in searches for \"Move to Gibraltar\" in London since polls closed #EUref https://t.co/aMkqjxXH2i pic.twitter.com/wXa1Rk7zjE \u2014 GoogleTrends (@GoogleTrends) June 24, 2016\n\nThere is only one lesson that can be drawn from the Google Trends for Brexit, do some research BEFORE you vote in such historic referendums, not AFTER.",
