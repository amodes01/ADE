    "text": "Four years ago almost to the day, the then mayor of London, Boris Johnson, appeared on the David Letterman show. He did what he does best: brag outrageously about himself in a way that was at once endearingly ironic yet made no attempt to disguise the size of his astronomical ambitions.\n\n\u201cI suppose I could be president of the United States,\u201d he said, \u201cyou know, technically speaking.\u201d\n\n\n\nThat brag would no longer apply today. The New York-born and hence US citizen Johnson, 52, renounced his American passport last year in a wrangle over IRS taxes. With it went all hope \u2013 tongue-in-cheek or otherwise \u2013 of ever occupying the White House.\n\nBesides, the famously blond-haired conservative now has his eyes on other targets. On the back of his embrace of the Leave cause in the British referendum on membership of the European Union, and its shock victory on Thursday, he has been propelled into a position he has long coveted: front-running contender for No 10 Downing Street.\n\nShortly after David Cameron announced his resignation as prime minister on Friday, bookmakers declared Johnson favorite to succeed his Tory party colleague in the fall.\n\n\u201cI believe we now have a glorious opportunity,\u201d Johnson said, referring to the future of the nation in words that could equally be applied to his own.\n\nThis is the moment for Boris, a British politician who has entered that rarified club of those like Beyonc\u00e9 or Drake who need no last name. Having spent years cultivating the look of a prize poodle in need of a good grooming, he is one of the most distinctive characters in the country.\n\n\n\nHe has also studiously honed and polished his public persona: part humorist, part wordsmith and statesman. Having been educated at Britain\u2019s most elite boarding school, Eton, with a plummy accent to match, he now claims the voice of the common man.\n\nBut such clever artifice leaves many Britons wondering where Boris the construct ends and the true Boris begins. An opinion poll this month had 41% of respondents saying they thought Johnson had thrown his hat in with the Leave camp because he believed it was best for the country; 39% thought it was done merely to forward his own political career.\n\nThat is a theme that stretches back to his early career as a journalist in Britain\u2019s notoriously cutthroat newspaper business. As Martin Fletcher reminded readers of the New York Times, in 1988 Johnson was sacked from the Times of London for making up a quote \u2013 he put words into the mouth of an Oxford don who also happened to be his godfather.\n\nA similar cavalier relationship with actuality marked his reporting stint for the Daily Telegraph in Brussels, where he made his name as a colorful character. Sonia Purnell, author of Just Boris: A Tale of Blond Ambition, worked as his No 2 in Brussels for the Telegraph in the 1990s and had a ring-side seat at the development of the classic Boris style.\n\n\u201cHe wrote excoriating copy about the EU,\u201d she said, \u201cgoing way beyond the boundaries of truth. But in private he would be rather sympathetic about the European project and its purpose: by instinct he was never in favor of Britain leaving.\u201d\n\nPurnell is convinced that Johnson created this double act \u2013 saying one thing in public, another in private \u2013 as a way of getting on.\n\n\u201cIt was his way to make his mark by standing out from the crowd,\u201d she said. \u201cI think the same thing has happened with Brexit, he needed to take the opposite stance to Cameron and Remain so he could position himself to take over.\u201d\n\nFor a politician potentially poised for the UK\u2019s highest office, Johnson is a bag of contradictions. He may be about to greatly enhance his own standing, but only at the cost of diminishing that of the country he seeks to lead.\n\nHe stepped down as mayor of London last month, after eight years. Yet in the EU referendum the city he led for so long voted 60% to 40% for Remain, exposing another vast gulf in his posturing.\n\nThen there is the paradox that a politician who has issues with integrity should liken himself none-too subtly to Winston Churchill, the British wartime leader who had no problem expressing his true mind. Here again, the question arises of the demarcation line between the genuine Boris Johnson and his scheming alter ego.\n\nView image in fullscreen Johnson visits the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum in Washington. Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA\n\nPurnell noted that in the introduction to his biography of the great man, The Churchill Factor, Johnson mentions one individual 31 times \u2013 Boris Johnson.\n\n\u201cDraw your own conclusions,\u201d she said.\n\nThe rise of an opportunistic politician who plays on populist fears about a sluggish economy and immigration to further his own prospects also echoes loudly across the Atlantic. Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cinsurgent\u201d assault on the US presidency begs inevitable comparison.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s not just that the two men both have funny hair, which gave the Briton the uncomfortable experience of being mistaken for the real estate billionaire on a recent trip to New York. It\u2019s that they both appear to be driven by one political aim above all others: their own ascendancy.\n\n\n\nShould both achieve their objective, the chilling prospect opens of two master self-publicists with outsized egos ensconced in Downing Street and the Oval Office. Now that would truly be a special relationship.\n\n",
