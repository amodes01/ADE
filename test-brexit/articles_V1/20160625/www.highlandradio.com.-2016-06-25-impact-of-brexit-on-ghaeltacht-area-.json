    "text": "\n\nFollowing Britain\u2019s vote to leave the EU, \u00dadar\u00e1s na Gaeltachta has issued a statement outlining the impact of Brexit on the Gaeltacht economy and tourism\n\nIn a statement, Udaras na Gaeltachta says the UK market is the first step to export for many of their client companies based in the Gaeltacht area.\n\nNearly 20% of Udaras client companies\u2019 export sales are to the UK and are worth \u20ac100 million a year. The agency says that will now very much depend on how the value of Sterling works out over the coming months.\n\nUdaras says in the short term, the industry most likely to be impacted by Brexit is tourism.\n\nWith a total of 3.3 million UK tourists visiting Ireland each year, a falling Sterling rate means Ireland may be less competitive for UK tourists in monetary terms.",
