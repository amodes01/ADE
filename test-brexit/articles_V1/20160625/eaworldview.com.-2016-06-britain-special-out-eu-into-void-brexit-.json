    "text": "PHOTO: Remain supporters face the result of Britain\u2019s European Union referendum early Friday morning\n\nNine experts from the University of Birmingham \u2014 most of whom made eve-of-referendum videos assessing the issues \u2014 follow up with an assessment of the Brexit verdict and what comes next.\n\nOriginally published by the Birmingham Perspective:\n\nSee EA\u2019s full Britain and Europe coverage\n\nJenny Phillimore: Anti-Immigration Sentiment v. Immigration Realities\n\nA devastating result and a dark day for Britain. It seems that a small majority of the British (or should I say English and Welsh) electorate were convinced by the hateful and, frankly, dishonest Leave campaign. The economic, political, social, and cultural consequences will be with us for decades impacting on our children and grandchildren.\n\nAnti-immigration sentiment appears to have driven this result. Yet even the Leave campaign refused to promise that Brexit will deliver in terms of reducing net immigration, and one of the few points they conceded was that Britain\u2019s economy depends on migrants.\n\nWith a minimum of two years until we formally break with Europe, the inevitable turbulence in our economy may well be coupled with a spike in immigration as those contemplating coming to Britain take their last chance to do so. Meanwhile the three million EU citizens who reside amongst us \u2014 many doing the dirty, dangerous and difficult jobs that we do not want, others contributing their skills and knowledge \u2014 will feel increasingly disenfranchised with this result perceived as a rejection of them and all they have offered us.\n\nTim Haughton: The Effective Myth of \u201cTake Back Control\u201d\n\nThe reason why the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union can be expressed in three words: \u201cTake Back Control\u201d. The Leave side used the alluring slogan repeatedly and relentlessly, whereas the Remain side never coined a simple and effective slogan.\n\nLeave\u2019s slogan was vague and often masked an inaccurate description of decision-making in the EU. But in political campaigns what matters is not what is accurate, but what works.\n\n\u201cTake back control\u201d combined a sense of a positive future ,albeit never defined or elaborated, with a sense of rightful ownership. Moreover, it helped to mobilize the anti-establishment support of voters who felt let down by their politicians.\n\nThe Brexit referendum, as referenda are so often, was only driven in part by the question on the ballot paper. Frustrated by the sense that the political class had failed them, many ordinary citizens took the opportunity to vent their fury.\n\nFiona de Londras: The Challenge of Forthcoming Negotiations\n\nOnce triggered, Article 50 will usher in up to two years of negotiation resulting in Brexit and a treaty on the UK\u2019s future relationship with the European Union\n\nThese negotiations are complex. The UK will have to determine what it wants; this will require domestic political leadership and clarity that is not currently in evidence. Furthermore, every member state will have to determine its priorities and bring these together in a common EU vision. In this, weighted votes will be used so that more powerful states have a louder voice than smaller states, although in practice consensus is preferred.\n\nIf the Treaty goes beyond matters of trade (which it likely will), it will have to be ratified by every other member state before finalisation. The European Parliament also has a veto option. That\u2019s 28 potential vetoes on this new, post-Brexit arrangement, and all held by parties with less at stake than the UK, with the possible exception of Ireland.\n\nThus, while the Leave campaign made much of its desire to \u201ctake back control\u201d, the UK may well find itself with remarkably little \u201ccontrol\u201d over the final agreement and its future relationship with the EU.\n\nHuw Macartney: Shock and Decline\n\nThis will certainly be a Black Friday for sterling and global financial markets. The real issue is the longer-term decline that will follow the immediate shock.\n\nEven the Brexit campaigners admitted that Exit would inevitably be painful in the \u201cshort term\u201d. Aside from the blame tactics, against Europe and immigrants, used by the Brexiteers though, there was also a promise of hope.\n\nYet we have already seen the effect that the Referendum uncertainty had on investment and the economic recovery in the first half of 2016. And so as that uncertainty continues, almost certainly for more than the two year renegotiation period, recession will lead to further job losses and welfare cuts and that hope will quickly evaporate.\n\nExperts predicted this, but we were told that we didn\u2019t need experts. But the reality is that the Leave voters weren\u2019t told how bad things are going to get (for them).\n\nAnd as that reality starts to bite, the politics of hate, targeting immigrants and the politics of austerity, targeting the poor, will only increase. If we think Britain looks divided now, I fear that our condition is only going to deteriorate.\n\nScott Lucas: \u201cGod Help Our Country\u201d\n\nThe former leader of the Liberal Democrats, Paddy Ashdown, captured the moment in four words after the BBC declared victory for the Leave campaign in Britain\u2019s EU referendum:\n\nGod help our country.\n\nI could try to soften Ashdown\u2019s reaction or cloak it in academic analysis. I won\u2019t.\n\nSee full response in Britain Analysis: \u201cGod Help Our Country\u201d \u2014 UK Out of European Union\n\nCatherine Needham: The National Health Service\n\nWhat are the implications of the referendum result for the NHS? There are lots of things we don\u2019t know yet. Here are some that we do:\n\nWhat will not happen is \u00a3350 million a week more for the NHS. Even the UK Independence party leader Nigel Farage said, soon after the result was announced, that it was \u201ca mistake\u201d to make that claim. The NHS faces intense financial pressures and the best way to address those pressures is through a growing economy and increased tax revenues. The financial uncertainties introduced by the Leave vote look very unlikely to generate that growth, in the short-term at least.\n\nThe Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership \u2014 a trade deal between the US and the EU that had been feared by some as exposing the NHS to marketization \u2014 is likely to recede from view as Britain \u201ctakes back\u201d its \u201csovereignty\u201d. However, people opposed to NHS marketization would be na\u00efve to see this as an EU-led agenda, when so much of the opening up of the NHS to market competition has come from the policies of recent Westminster governments.\n\nHealth services research will suffer as universities find sources of European funding closed off, as well as reduced freedom of movement for academics and students sharing knowledge across the continent.\n\nAnthony Arnull: The Burden of Black Friday\n\nA question near the top of the Government\u2019s agenda, following the vote to leave the EU, will be when to inform the Union that the UK intends to withdraw. Once that is done, there would then be a period of up to two years to reach an agreement. That period could be extended, but only if everyone agrees.\n\nThe agreement would deal with disentangling the UK from the rest of the EU. What should be done about EU nationals resident here and UK nationals resident in the EU, UK staff working for the EU, and EU bodies based in the UK? Once out, the UK would need to strike new trade deals with the EU and other countries. This could take many years.\n\nAt the same time, all national rules based on EU obligations will need to be catalogued. Should they be kept or replaced? If the UK wants continued access to the Single Market, it may decide to leave some of them in place. If it decides to replace any, what should the new rules say?\n\nAll this will place an enormous burden on the Government and Civil Service and provide much work for lawyers.\n\nSotirios Zartaloudis: Far-Right Populism\n\nThis result confirms what we have been witnessing in England over the last ten years, a steady rise of far-right extremism and populism. Using a \u201cscapegoat\u201d agenda and promoting the Euro-racism of \u201cthe decent people\u201d \u2014 Nigel Farage\u2019s phrase \u2014 against \u201cEuropeans\u201d in Brussels and in the UK, Britain becomes the first country to decide to leave the EU.\n\nParts of Britain have been out of Europe mentally for some years now. But the worst is yet to come. Brexiteers have a clear agenda of dismantling key aspects of employment law legislation, environmental protection, and other market-correcting regulations.\n\nToday most British voters feel closer to the angry supporters of Donald Trump, where far-right populism is used strategically by rich elites who accuse foreigners and \u201cexperts\u201d of being the key culprits responsible for increasing economic precariousness. One wonders if they will ever realize that this is a convenient excuse used by Westminster to shift the blame elsewhere.\n\nThis is an own-goal of historic proportions that gives pleasure to far-right populists around the world, such as Vladimir Putin and Marine LePen). It may signify the dismantling of the UK, given the strong pro-EU voting in Scotland, Northern Ireland, and London.\n\nDavid Dunn: The Place of England-Wales in the World\n\nAlthough foreign and security issues were not central to the referendum debate, the impact of Brexit may be momentous. Brexit has the potential to re-energize the Irish question and Scottish support for Europe presages a second independence referendum \u2014 one which has implications for the UK\u2019s nuclear status given that these forces are all based on the Clyde.\n\n\u201cTaking back control\u201d of trade policy will also affect England\u2019s foreign policy. In seeking deals with China, the Middle East, and beyond, the Foreign Office will be less inclined to side with its major allies in criticizing these states when its bilateral trade access depends upon accommodation. This may create distance from Washington, Berlin, and Paris as London kowtows to Bejing and others for market access.\n\nThe biggest impact, however, will be on Europe itself. President Obama\u2019s support for Remain was premised on the idea that an outward looking, Atlanticist Europe was better for the world and more likely with the UK in it. Following Brexit, the forces of disintegration and xenophobia have been strengthened in Europe and the progress made over the last 70 years towards a tolerant, integrated, and liberal political community has been put at risk.\n\nThe consequences for the very nature of Europe have been raised by Brexit and go way beyond the uncertainty over what relations England-Wales will have with the continent and the rest of the world.",
