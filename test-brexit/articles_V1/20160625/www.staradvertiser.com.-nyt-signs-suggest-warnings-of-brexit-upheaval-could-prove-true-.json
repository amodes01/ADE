    "text": "FRANKFURT, Germany >> Only hours after Britain decided to leave the European Union, Emmanuel Lumineau cast his own \u201cremain\u201d vote \u2014 with his feet. Lumineau said he would move to Paris from London and take about 10 employees at his financial startup with him.\n\nThe looming question Friday was how many other executives might reach the same conclusion, undermining Britain\u2019s status as the No. 1 destination in Europe for foreign investment.\n\nLumineau\u2019s reasoning was simple. His customers operate under European rules and so must he. \u201cWe need to be inside,\u201d said Lumineau, the French chief executive of BrickVest, a company that allows customers to invest small sums in real estate online.\n\nThe long-term business consequences of Brexit will take years to fully emerge, largely because no one knows what kind of new trade barriers and regulations will emerge from negotiations with the European Union. But already there were worrisome signs that the \u201cremain\u201d camp\u2019s warnings of economic tumult could come true.\n\nJamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, warned his staff in a memo Friday that, in months to come, \u201cwe may need to make changes to our European legal entity structure and the location of some roles.\u201d Dimon had said before the vote that up to a quarter of JPMorgan\u2019s 16,000 employees in Britain might need to relocate.\n\nShares of British property companies plunged Friday on fears that the Brexit vote will cause a recession and deflate London\u2019s real estate boom.\n\nDon't miss out on what's happening!

This form is protected by reCAPTCHA.\n\nJuergen Maier, the top executive in Britain of Siemens, the German electronics and engineering giant, said it might need to rethink its investment plans. He predicted others would do the same, at least until they can judge the impact of Brexit.\n\n\u201cAll companies will be holding fire to see what happens,\u201d Maier said.\n\nFor decades, big multinational companies have used Britain as their business-friendly, English-speaking beachhead to Europe. As a member of the European Union, Britain offered frictionless access to the mainland, while the legacy of Margaret Thatcher meant there was far less regulation than in France or Germany.\n\nNow that the English Channel suddenly seems a lot wider, businesses are waiting nervously to see what kind of new Europe will take shape. Negotiations on a post-Brexit trade relationship are likely to be messy and take years. And in the meantime, Europe could be in for serious political instability as right-wing parties in France, Finland and other countries try to ride Britain\u2019s coattails out of the union.\n\nIt is not all bad for business. The plunging pound will help the tourism industry by making Britain a cheaper place to visit. BMW Mini automobiles and other products manufactured in Britain will be less expensive for people paying in euros and other foreign currencies. That could be good for exports.\n\nBritain could also be free to follow its free market instincts without interference from Brussels. If the \u201cleave\u201d forces are correct, that would make the country a magnet for companies seeking to escape the regulatory corset of mainland Europe.\n\nBut any advantages are likely to be outweighed by the enormous uncertainties ahead. With no road map, executive decision-making could be paralyzed, and investment could come to a standstill.\n\nBritain\u2019s financial services industry, which employs 1.2 million people, is especially vulnerable. New stock listings in London are likely to all but cease while companies take stock of the damage.\n\nForeign banks may face the costs of moving thousands of employees out of London to the Continent so they can satisfy regulations governing trading and investment advice on behalf of European clients. London had provided a convenient hub to serve Europe.\n\nJames P. Gorman, the Morgan Stanley chief executive, and Colm Kelleher, the president, said Friday that they had no plans to relocate staff from London. But in a memo to employees \u2014 many of whom worked through the night to handle a huge trading volume \u2014 they said they might \u201cconsider adjustments to our operating model.\u201d\n\nEven Deutsche Bank, the symbol of German banking nominally based in Frankfurt, uses London as a base for investment banking and trading. It has often made most of its profit there.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid that this is not such a good day for Europe,\u201d said John Cryan, the Deutsche Bank chief, who happens to be British. \u201cAt this stage, we cannot fully foresee the consequences, but there\u2019s no doubt that they will be negative on all sides.\u201d\n\nPerhaps no company embodies the European project more than Airbus, a politically driven consortium that allowed Europe to remain a player in the aircraft industry after smaller national manufacturers could no longer compete. Airbus produces wings in Broughton and employs 15,000 people in Britain plus tens of thousands more at suppliers.\n\nOutside the union, Britain may no longer have as strong a claim on those jobs. \u201cThis is a lose-lose result for both Britain and Europe,\u201d said Thomas Enders, the Airbus chief executive. \u201cWe will review our U.K. investment strategy, like everybody else will.\u201d\n\nOther sectors as different as petrochemicals and Scottish whisky could be damaged by increases in customs duties, diverging legal requirements and slumping growth. Energy companies like BP or Royal Dutch Shell are worried about having to deal with an unwieldy snarl of differing regulations once the European Union umbrella is gone. \u201cUncertainty is never helpful for a business such as ours,\u201d BP said in a statement Friday.\n\nU.S. technology companies like Google and Facebook have sizable operations in Britain, though their headquarters are technically in low-tax countries like Ireland and the Netherlands. Google employs roughly 1,000 engineers across Britain, working on global products like its search engine and Android mobile operating system. Technology companies could be under pressure to move sales and marketing jobs from Britain, so these employees can still have access to Europe\u2019s common marketplace.\n\nThe ties are especially close between Britain and Germany, where the dismay was particularly pronounced. Britain imports more products from Germany than anywhere else. Britain is Germany\u2019s third-largest customer for exports, after the United States and France.\n\nGerman brands like BMW, Mercedes and Volkswagen account for half the cars sold in Britain, according to the German Association of the Automobile Industry. Sales could suffer if Britain raises tariffs on imported vehicles. Shares of BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen plunged Friday.\n\nGerman companies have helped keep alive manufacturing in Britain. Mini and Rolls-Royce are considered iconic British car brands, but both are owned by BMW. Bentley belongs to Volkswagen.\n\nProbably the most important company in the renaissance of British car manufacturing has been Nissan, which has pumped close to 4 billion pounds since the mid-1980s into a world-class factory in Sunderland in northeast England. Last year the company produced about 475,000 vehicles, about a third of Britain\u2019s total, exporting about 55 percent of them to the European Union.\n\nYet despite the European Union\u2019s importance to local jobs, voters in Sunderland voted overwhelmingly to leave. The Brexit camp won 61 percent of the vote compared with 39 percent for remain. Stuart Boyd, a Nissan spokesman, said Friday that the company was not ready to comment on how it might respond.\n\nPerhaps workers believed that Nissan sales would increase because of a weaker pound. But any stimulus to British exports from a devalued currency is likely to be offset by higher prices for imported goods. Britain has a trade deficit, so a weaker pound is on balance negative.\n\nAnother huge foreign manufacturer is Siemens, based in Munich, which has 13 factories and 14,000 workers in Britain making products like electric motors, gas turbines and trains. Siemens is not about to pull up stakes. But Maier, the Siemens chief for Britain, said the Brexit vote could force the company to recalculate some investment decisions.\n\nFor example, European Union grants help finance Siemens research and development projects in Britain in areas like self-driving cars. That financial support will disappear once Britain is out.\n\n\u201cThe question is more about future investment, future research and development,\u201d Maier said. \u201cThat\u2019s hanging in the balance.\u201d\n\nHe embodies the strong ties between Britain and the mainland. Born in Germany, Maier has lived in Britain since he was 10, studied there, and speaks with a British accent. He said that there was a palpable sense of anxiety Friday morning when he visited a company office in Manchester that is used by engineers and customer service representatives.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s usually a really buzzing office,\u201d Maier said. \u201cThis morning it was definitely quiet. Customers weren\u2019t calling. That\u2019s not a good sign. The country is just taking all of this in.\u201d\n\n\u00a9 2016 The New York Times Company",
