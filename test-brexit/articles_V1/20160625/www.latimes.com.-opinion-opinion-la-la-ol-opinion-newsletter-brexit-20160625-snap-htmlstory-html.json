    "text": "Happy Saturday, everyone. This is Matthew Fleischer, digital editor of The Times\u2019 Opinion section, filling in for Paul Thornton.\n\nNotice your 401(k) take a precipitous dip overnight? You are not alone. We can all thank Britain for voting Thursday to \u201cBrexit\u201d the European Union \u2014 a decision that is wreaking havoc on financial markets, and likely will for some time.\n\nWhatever financial unease we\u2019re feeling at the moment, however, is nothing compared with the toll the Brits just willed upon themselves. In a timely op-ed, Brian Klaas and Marcel Dirsus dissect the financial carnage that comes with roughly a sixth of the European Union economy deciding to secede, and the dangerous motivations behind such an obviously self-injurious move \u2014 motivations that are uncomfortably familiar here on this side of the pond.\n\nWe find ourselves in a moment of global fear. The democratic identities of Britain and the United States are under threat \u2014 not from immigrants or even changing values, but from nationalists and xenophobes exploiting citizens' darkest worries with populist projects, including Donald Trump\u2019s campaign for the U.S. presidency and Brexit. To many voters, the world is a scary place. Terrorists seem to lurk everywhere. Uncertainty surrounds us. Change is rapid and some aren't keeping up. Unsurprisingly, politicians of many stripes are capitalizing on our fears to rally voters against trade, immigration and international cooperation. The costs will be substantial. Economists, business leaders and scholars almost universally agree that Britain's retreat from the EU is a self-inflicted economic blunder. Recessions are contagious, and given London\u2019s place as a global financial hub, Brexit will give Britain a particularly virulent cough. The pound\u2019s value will likely tumble. The British treasury estimates that the nation\u2019s households each stand to lose an average of \u00a34,300, or about $7,000. And yet, tens of millions of voters were willing to take that hit. \u00bb Click here to read more.\n\nIt\u2019s no \u2018Brexit\u2019 in terms of contentiousness, but the rhetoric surrounding Metro\u2019s plan to install a permanent sales tax on Los Angeles County residents for transportation projects is heating up. Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti personally went to bat for the tax in an op-ed. His rationale: Once you build a public mass transit system, you have to maintain it. L.A. Times\n\nThe Times editorial board also supports the tax \u2014 though not without reservations. \u201cA time-limited tax,\u201d it argues, \u201cforces Metro and its political leaders to include the public in its decision making process, lay out its goals and be more judicious with taxpayer monies.\u201d L.A. Times\n\nSupreme Court Justice Sonya Sotomayor\u2019s scathing dissent in Utah vs. Strieff, a 4th Amendment case about police searches, was a wake-up call for columnist Meghan Daum. \u201cI have generally operated on the notion that if you're law-abiding, the police are nothing to be afraid of,\u201d she writes. \u201cI\u2019m an NPR-listening, Obama-loving, supposedly enlightened liberal who\u2019s supposed to think beyond that.\u201d L.A. Times\n\nDonald Trump's campaign doesn't have enough money for a three-bedroom home in Santa Monica, let alone a presidential race. In contrast, Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign had more than $42 million in cash on hand and raised $16 million more than Trump in May alone. That said, don\u2019t dance on the Donald\u2019s grave yet.
