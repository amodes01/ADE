    "text": "WARSAW:NATO leaders met Friday for a crucial summit in Warsaw to send a clear message to a resurgent Russia while trying to contain the fallout from Britain\u2019s dramatic divorce from the European Union.\n\nBritain\u2019s future will dominate talks between US President Barack Obama, attending his last NATO summit, EU President Donald Tusk and European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker.\n\n\u201cThis may be the most important moment for our transatlantic alliance since the end of the Cold War,\u201d Obama wrote in the Financial Times as the two-day summit got under way. He said he was also \u201cconfident that the UK and the EU will be able to agree on an orderly transition to a new relationship\u201d. Obama was due to meet British Prime Minister David Cameron, who is set to resign over the Brexit vote, at the summit.\n\nNATO chief Jens Stoltenberg insisted on Friday that while the June 23 referendum result would inevitably change Britain\u2019s ties to the EU, \u201cit will not change UK\u2019s leading position in NATO.\u201d\n\nObama was meanwhile being briefed on the shootings in Dallas, where five police officers were killed by snipers during protests against police shooting deaths of black Americans.\n\n\u201cThe President has been updated on the shooting of police officers in Dallas. He asked his team to keep him updated on the situation as they get additional information,\u201d the White House said.\n\nSecurity was tight across the Polish capital with police locking down roads to the venue in Poland\u2019s national stadium and helicopters flying overhead. The uncertainty over Britain, a key nuclear-armed ally, comes as NATO prepares to endorse its biggest revamp since the end of the Cold War in response to Russia\u2019s 2014 intervention in Ukraine.\n\nThe summit centrepiece is a \u201cReadiness Action Plan\u201d to bolster NATO resources and readiness in the face of a Russia under President Vladimir Putin that the allies now see as more aggressive and dangerously unpredictable. NATO leaders will approve rotating four battalions in eastern Europe \u2014 in Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, up to 4,000 troops in all, as a collective tripwire against fresh Russian adventurism. Stoltenberg said this would \u201cmake clear that an attack on one ally will be met by forces from across the whole alliance.\u201d\n\nThe plan also includes a pledge to spend two percent of annual economic output on defence, ending years of cuts, and the creation of a 5,000-strong \u201cSpearhead\u201d force ready to deploy within days.\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel said Thursday that while Russia\u2019s actions in Ukraine had eroded mutual trust, the alliance should balance \u201cdeterrence and dialogue\u201d with Moscow.\n\nStoltenberg however sounded a conciliatory note on Russia, with the alliance due to hold fresh talks with Moscow just after the summit.\n\n\u201cRussia is our biggest neighbour and an integral party of European security so sustaining dialogue is essential,\u201d Stoltenberg said. \u201cNATO does not want a new Cold War. The Cold War is history and should remain history.\u201d Russia has said it will examine closely what is decided at the summit for how it affects its security. Moscow bitterly opposes NATO\u2019s expansion into its Soviet-era satellites, which it sees as a threat to its own security. It is even more strident in its opposition to the Ballistic Missile Defence system the United States is building and which the summit is due to declare has reached an initial operating level.\n\nWashington says the shield is designed to counter missile threats from Iran or the Middle East but Russia says that once the system becomes fully operational in 2018, it will undercut its strategic nuclear deterrent. Separately Russia warned Friday that the US deployment of an advanced missile defence system in South Korea would have \u201cirreparable consequences\u201d, echoing warnings by China.",
