    "text": "Warsaw: US President Barack Obama urged NATO leaders on Friday to stand firm against a resurgent Russia over its seizure of Crimea from Ukraine, saying Britain's vote to leave the European Union should not weaken the Western defence alliance.\n\nIn an article published in the Financial Times newspaper as he arrived for his last summit of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation before he leaves office in January, Obama said America's \"special relationship\" with Britain would survive the referendum decision he had warned against.\n\n\"The special relationship between the US and the UK will endure. I have no doubt that the UK will remain one of NATO's most capable members,\" he said, but noted that the vote raised significant questions about the future of EU integration.",
