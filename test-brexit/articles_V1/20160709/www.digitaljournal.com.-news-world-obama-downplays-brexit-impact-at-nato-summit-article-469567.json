    "text": "-\n\nNATO leaders united Saturday behind a policy of deterrence and dialogue with Russia after launching the alliance's biggest military revamp since the end of the Cold War to counter a resurgent Moscow.\n\nSecretary General Jens Stoltenberg said at a summit in Warsaw that they \"stand together\" on Russia, with NATO's eastern flank still nervous after Moscow's shock annexation of Crimea and the Ukraine conflict.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has opposed NATO's decision to put four battalions in Poland and the Baltic states, seeing the expansion into Moscow's Soviet-era backyard as a security threat.\n\nNATO is keen to downplay any divisions, but there have been calls from countries like France and Germany to avoid a Cold-War style stand-off when Moscow's help is needed on issues such as terrorism.\n\nArmed forces in Europe Simon MALFATTO, Sophie RAMIS, Iris ROYER DE VERICOURT, AFP\n\n\"The alliance is united, we stand together,\" Stoltenberg said when asked about talks the 28 NATO leaders had on Russia on Friday night.\n\n\"The united message is that defence and dialogue are what our relationship is based on.\"\n\nStoltenberg announced earlier this week that the alliance would hold fresh talks with Russia on Wednesday as a gesture of the West's openness and good faith.\n\n- 'No Cold War situation' -\n\nBut French President Francois Hollande has appeared to offer more of an olive branch to Moscow, saying on Friday Russia was neither adversary or threat but a partner.\n\nUS President Barack Obama, pictured with US Secretary of State John Kerry (L) and White House National Security Advisor Susan Rice, at his final NATO meeting before he leaves office Wojtek Radwanski, AFP\n\nAsked if he agreed with Hollande, Stoltenberg said there was no \"imminent threat\" to any NATO ally, adding: \"Russia is neither a strategic partner... but we are neither in a Cold War situation,\" he added.\n\nLeaders will discuss Ukraine with President Petro Poroshenko later Saturday.\n\nThe United States and European Union have both imposed sanctions on Moscow over the Ukraine crisis but in Europe in particular there are growing calls for them to be scaled back.\n\nFrance and Germany, which have strong political and economic ties to Russia, have played a leading role in efforts to solve the Ukraine conflict, helping to broker the Minsk ceasefire accords.\n\n(Front row, L-R) US President Barack Obama, France's President Francois Hollande, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and German Chancellor Angela Merkel prepare for a family photo during the NATO Summit in Warsaw on July 8, 2016 Janek Skarzynski, AFP/File\n\nNATO's unprecedented decision to put 4,000 troops on the ground in eastern member states has meanwhile done much to win over previously sceptical leaders in the region\n\nLithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite, a sharp critic of Putin, said a stronger NATO would be better able to talk to Russia.\n\n\"I am softening\" on the need for dialogue, Grybauskaite told AFP Saturday when asked if she was happy to see NATO upping its game. \"We are not closing ourselves (behind) an iron wall.\n\nPutin is however unlikely to miss the symbolic importance of the summit being held in Warsaw, the birthplace of the Soviet-era Warsaw Pact, once NATO's adversary.\n\nA Russian Yars RS-24 intercontinental ballistic missile system rolls through Red Square during a Victory Day parade in Moscow Kirill Kudryavtsev, AFP/File\n\nMoscow bitterly opposes NATO's expansion into its Soviet-era satellites, seeing it as part of an attempt by the West to surround it.\n\nRussia is even more critical of the Ballistic Missile Defence system the United States is building to counter missile threats from Iran or the Middle East, which NATO declared initially operational on Friday, saying it undercuts its nuclear deterrent.\n\n- Afghanistan commitment -\n\nNATO leaders meanwhile confirmed pledges to fund Afghanistan security forces through 2020, to combat Taliban rebels who are putting the Kabul government under intense pressure.\n\nUS President Barack Obama (R), pictured with Prime Minister David Cameron, said Britain and the EU could make an \"orderly transition to a new relationship\" Wojtek Radwanski, AFP\n\nStoltenberg said NATO will keep troops in Afghanistan through 2017 under its train and advise Resolute Support Mission but could not say when the alliance's longest military engagement might end.\n\n\"There's no reason to speculate exactly on how long it will continue. What we have seen is we are committed and we are ready to stay,\" Stoltenberg said of a war which has dragged on since 2001.\n\nThe 28-nation US-led alliance would look at the situation again next year, Stoltenberg said.\n\nUS President Barack Obama was forced this week to slow the US pullout due to the \"precarious\" security situation. Some 8,400 US troops will now remain in the war-ravaged country into next year, not 5,500 as planned.\n\nThe summit opened Friday under very heavy security overshadowed first by Britain's shock vote to quit the European Union and then the deadly shootings of police officers in Dallas.\n\nThe White House said Obama would now cut short a later stop in Spain to be able to visit Dallas next week.",
