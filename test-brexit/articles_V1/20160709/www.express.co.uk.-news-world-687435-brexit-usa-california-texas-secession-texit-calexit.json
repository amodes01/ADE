    "text": "GETTY Brexit could spark the break-up of the United States of America\n\nCampaign groups in Texas and California are both pushing for the independence of their states in the wake of last month\u2019s 52 to 48 per cent Brexit vote, which has reinvigorated long-running campaigns to \u201ctake control of our destiny.\u201d Texit, the secession of Texas from the United States, is the main goal of the Texas Nationalist Movement (TNM), who welcomed last month\u2019s historic vote for Britain to leave the European Union (EU). Campaign leader Danny Miller said: \u201cFrom the looks of it, the British people have chosen to take control of their political and economic destiny. The forces of fear have lost.\n\n\u201cIt is now important for Texas to look to Brexit as an inspiration and an example that Texans can also take control of our destiny. It is time for Texans to rally with us and fight for the right to become a self-governing nation.\u201d He called on the governor of Texas to support his group\u2019s desire for an Texit referendum, highlighting the state\u2019s forced submission to the national government - a comparison that could be made with the EU\u2019s overwhelming control over the laws and borders of the 28-country bloc.\n\nGETTY Texas has an incredibly strong identity and calls for outright independence are growing\n\nThe win for Brexit opens the door for Texit Danny Miller\n\nMr Miller said: \u201cIt is past time that the people of Texas had their say on our continued relationship with the Union and its sprawling Federal bureaucracy. \u201cThe win for Brexit opens the door for Texit by establishing, concretely, that it is possible to have an adult conversation on independence and letting the people have the final say.\u201d He pointed to his \u201c260,000 supporters\u201d and hundreds of thousands of social media followers as proof there was a real demand for an in-out referendum, concluding: \u201cFor several years now, we have been receiving new supporters and volunteers at a pace like we have never seen. \u201cAnd as word about the Brexit referendum has spread throughout Texas, people are realizing that the TNM is offering a real choice and a real solution and not just more of the same.\u201d\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Yes California is pushing for Calexit, the independence of California. The state boasts a population of 39million and an economy more successful than all but a handful of countries across the world. Leader Louis Marinelli said Brexit was a \u201cshining example\u201d of people power, and called for an in-out referendum to be held on the day of the 2020 US Presidential election. He said: \u201cIt was exciting to watch self-determination in action, and in the end the majority of the British people determined for themselves in a historic and inspiring election that their future would be better off independent of the European Union.\n\nGETTY The Leave victory has inspired several secession movements across Europe - and the USA",
