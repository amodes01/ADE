    "text": "WASHINGTON, U.S. The International Monetary Fund has reportedly indicated that the Eurozone is on its way towards an economic slowdown after Britain's decision to leave the European Union.\n\nAccording to reports, IMF now expects the Eurozone gross domestic product (GDP) to grow by 1.6 percent in 2016 and 1.4 percent in 2017 - a downgrade from their forecast of 1.7 percent for both years before Brexit.\n\nIt was added that the downgrade is indicative of rising uncertainty, fluctuations in markets and a potential decrease in exports to Britain.\n\nBrexit may reportedly have caused a potential delay in investments in Britain and Europe until trade and immigration arrangements are negotiated with the EU.\n\nMahmood Pradhan, deputy director of the IMF European department reportedly said, \"This is our very early thinking and assessment It's very, very early days to have any strong sense of confidence\" about how the U.K.-EU relationship will work out.\"\n\nHe added that the forecast was based on the assumption that Britain would work out exit negotiations that would give it access to the EU's single market of 500 million people but without EU membership, much like Norway's arrangement.\n\nMeanwhile, reports added that the U.K. saw a slowdown in permanent job hiring for the first time in nearly four months after the Brexit referendum.\n\nAn index reading of 49.3 was reportedly recorded for permanent placements in June 2016, down from 52.9 in May 2016.\n\nThe drop was reportedly due to uncertainty over Brexit - causing employers to avoid permanent hiring and opt instead for temporary, contract or interim staff as potential buffers.\n\nKevin Green, REC chief executive reportedly said, \"Whilst it is too early to assess what the impact of the vote to leave the EU will be on jobs, our data underlines the need for uncertainty to be minimised so that our economy and our labour market are not adversely affected. The best thing for business right now is clear and calm leadership and as much clarity as possible on what the post-EU future will look like.\"\n\nBrexit has also affected consumer confidence, which saw its sharpest drop in more than 20 years since the vote.\n\nA one-off survey reportedly revealed that around 60 percent of consumers expect the general economic situation to worsen in the next 12 months, increased from 46 percent in June, while just 20 percent expect it to improve, down from 27 percent in June again.\n\nFurther, the post-Brexit outlook was not helped by the U.K. trade gap, as exports slipped back from a rise in April.\n\nAccording to the Office for National Statistics, U.K.'s trade deficit on goods reportedly expanded to 2.3 billion in May, up from 2 billion in April, and trade deficits increased to 9.9 billion from 9.4 billion in April.",
