Ensuring employers can still access the people they need to succeed must now be top of the list in any negotiations,\u201d he said.\n\nThe uncertainty following the vote to leave the EU has also weighted on recruitment.\n\nIn the week before the referendum almost 1.5 million jobs were advertised online, dropping to under 820,000 in the following week, according to CEB, a consultancy.\n\nBrian Kropp, HR practice leader at CEB, said that the 47 per cent drop in job openings compared to last year was far outside the normal fluctuations seen by the company, which tend to be between 5 and 10 per cent.\n\nA separate report by Boston Consulting Group (BCG) said London could be drained of 20 per cent of jobs as up to 80,000 banking and finance roles could be moved from the capital to other centre in Europe. This is worse than the 55,000 jobs lost in London\u2019s financial sector during the years of the financial crisis between 2007 and 2010.\n\nInsurance, pharmaceutical and biotechnology jobs could also go, BCG said.",
