    "text": "The lopsided reality of Britain\u2019s relationship with the United States was underlined at the White House this week when it was asked to react to findings from the official UK report into the Iraq war.\n\n\n\n\u201cI will be with you, whatever,\u201d Tony Blair was revealed to have promised George W Bush in a secret letter sent eight months before the joint invasion. Subsequent British attempts to influence the conduct of the war, and crucially its disastrous aftermath, were nonetheless ignored, according to the report by Sir John Chilcot.\n\nFaced with a slew of such embarrassing disclosures, US reporters wanted to know if their government had a response to a report that took seven years to produce.\n\nNo American official had read it yet, replied spokesman Josh Earnest. Instead he reacted with a phrase that is obligatory on the rare occasions when the subject of the UK comes up in the White House briefing room.\n\n\u201cThe United States and the United Kingdom have a special relationship,\u201d he said. \u201cI would expect that that relationship will remain special and strong.\u201d\n\nFor British diplomats \u2013 worried more than ever about their access to power after Barack Obama\u2019s dire warnings over Brexit \u2013 such platitudes might sound reassuring.\n\nObama had threatened that Britain would go the \u201cback of the queue\u201d in trade negotiations with the US if it left the European Union.\n\nAt an embassy drinks reception held at the UK ambassador\u2019s grand Lutyens-designed residence in Washington a week after the referendum, the feared loss of influence was on everybody\u2019s lips.\n\nWhile Britain may have chosen to cut loose from Europe in search of a new identity in the Anglosphere, the phrase \u201cspecial relationship\u201d has rarely sounded more hackneyed on the other side of the Atlantic.\n\nIn part, Obama\u2019s polite froideur reflects competing demands for his affection. He calls France the \u201coldest ally\u201d \u2013 a pointed reminder that Britain and America have not always been on the same side of the battlefield. Germany\u2019s Angela Merkel is the \u201ctrusted partner\u201d and Canada the \u201cclosest of friends\u201d.\n\nAmong the dozens of world leaders he speaks to every month, it is the Chinese and Russians who tend to attract most media interest; the awkward Israelis the most political attention.\n\n\n\nOn Friday in Poland, during a Nato summit in which Britain remains a key player, Obama met the presidents of the European council and the European commission to discuss how Europe can maintain political cohesion after the UK exit.\n\n\n\nBefore arriving at the summit in Warsaw, Obama described the combined challenges facing Europe as \u201cthe most important moment for our transatlantic alliance since the end of the cold war\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe special relationship between the US and the UK will endure,\u201d he wrote in the Financial Times.\u201d [And] ... given the current threats facing Europe, I fully expect that Britain will continue to be a major contributor to European security.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe days ahead will continue to be difficult,\u201d he added. \u201cBut, if the past seven decades teach us anything, it is that we will prevail if we stay united, strong and true to our democratic values. I am confident we will.\u201d\n\nThough outgoing UK prime minister David Cameron was there too, to announce the deployment of extra troops to Nato\u2019s eastern flank, the White House had scheduled no private meeting with his beleaguered counterpart \u2013 spending time instead with Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg and Polish president Andrzej Duda, before flying on to Spain.\n\nThe Nato summit is, of course, a timely reminder of the enduring importance of the Atlantic alliance and Britain\u2019s role as a pivotal military partner for Washington.\n\nBut, as Chilcot\u2019s revelations of the Blair/Bush correspondence demonstrate, the offer of British troops is no longer the guarantee of either military success or reciprocal political influence that it was when the special relationship was first forged during the second world war.\n\nFor American scholars of the evolving ties between London and Washington, the relationship was never as clear-cut or special as politicians would like to claim it was, but it has definitely seen better days.\n\nLynne Olson is author of Citizens of London, which revealed the extraordinary lengths Winston Churchill went to persuade a reluctant US president to join a war.\n\n\u201cThere is a still a closeness on both sides \u2013 within government and within the military \u2013 but the relationship seems to have eroded quite a bit,\u201d she says. \u201cThe memory of why there was a special relationship, the memory of the war, this has mostly gone. There has been a loosening. It is not what is once was.\u201d\n\nOlson also believes the personal chemistry between politicians and the leadership they provide \u2013 or don\u2019t \u2013 often plays a more significant role than the underlying relations between governments.\n\n\u201cPeople say that personalities don\u2019t count, or question the \u2018great man theory\u2019 of history, but a few people can really change things \u2013 as we\u2019ve just seen with Brexit, for example,\u201d adds Olson.\n\nBut others believe the depth of shared history and culture mean both countries will continue to mean a lot to each other whatever the state of letter-writing and summit-making is between the leaders.\n\n\u201cFor the American public, neither Brexit nor Chilcot mean very much,\u201d says international relations professor Philip Seib, author of Taken for Granted: The Future of US-British Relations. \u201cFrom a public standpoint nothing much changes: the primary interest is in other things, like the royal family.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you get to the policymakers, it gets more complicated, particularly after Brexit,\u201d he adds. \u201cBut there is a residual feeling that the special relationship is still special: there are so many things that tie the US and UK together. There aren\u2019t that many countries that are real friends, especially among major powers.\u201d\n\nYet even relatively sympathetic US observers of Britain question the logic of Blair\u2019s gamble during the Iraq war.\n\nAccording to both the Chilcot report and recent comments by the former prime minister himself, a major factor in his decision to offer such unequivocal support to Bush was a fear that Britain would lose influence and respect in Washington if it stood on the sidelines after the 9/11 attacks.\n\nCountries such as France and Germany that were more cautious did indeed receive US opprobrium at the time \u2013 famously leading to French fries being renamed \u201cFreedom Fries\u201d and the only half-in-jest insult \u201ccheese-eating surrender monkey\u201d.\n\nBut critics of Blair have pointed out that it did little to damage long-term relations with other European powers. Some Democrats in Washington grumble that Blair actually did great harm by facilitating and encouraging the disastrous intervention in Iraq \u2013 privately holding him more accountable because he gave the spurious justifications a more articulate veneer.\n\nHad Blair done the opposite, the short-term consequences for the special relationship might have been negative, but respect and sympathy for the UK in the long term may have, with hindsight, been improved.\n\nAbove all, it seems that Blair once again proved the increasingly one-way nature of this unrequited love affair.\n\n\u201cThere would have been a certain cooling in the relationship with the Bush administration if Blair had refused to go along with the invasion,\u201d concludes Seib. \u201cBut Bush would probably have done it any way, even if no one had stood with him.\u201d",
