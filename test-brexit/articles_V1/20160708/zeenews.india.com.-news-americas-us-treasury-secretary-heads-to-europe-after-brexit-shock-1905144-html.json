    "text": "US Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew will travel to Europe next week for talks on the economic landscape in the wake of Britain`s vote to quit the European Union, the Treasury said Friday.\n\nLew will hold talks with counterparts in Paris, London, Brussels and Berlin during the July 11-14 trip.\n\n\n\nThe main subject will be \"continued economic stability and shared economic growth in the United Kingdom, Europe, and globally following the United Kingdom`s referendum on membership in the European Union,\" the Treasury Department said in a statement.Lew also plans to meet business leaders and market participants to discuss the global economy.US President Barack Obama said last week that the Brexit vote raises \"longer-term concerns\" about global growth at a time of already weak economic output.And speaking at the NATO summit in Warsaw on Friday, Obama insisted that Brexit would not harm transatlantic unity, while also warning against a bitter divorce that would undermine security in the face of a resurgent Russia.",
