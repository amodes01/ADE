    "text": "The mood in Kyiv was glum after Britain\u2019s shock decision to leave the European Union following a countrywide referendum.\n\nThe city saw deadly mass protests two years ago in defense of Ukraine\u2019s rapprochement with the European Union, and news of the Brexit vote met with dismay in the Ukrainian capital.\n\nOfficials mostly put on a brave face, voicing confidence that the EU will remain united despite Britain voting to leave the bloc.\n\nTheir statement nonetheless betrayed concerns that the Brexit could weaken Brussels\u2019 support for their country and undermine its efforts to stand up to Russia.\n\n\u201cWe have suffered for our European choice and continue to pay a high price for it by defending not only our sovereignty but also the eastern border of Europe,\u201d said Prime Minister Volodymyr Groysman. \u201cTherefore, we will continue to fight for a stronger united Europe and pour new energy into the European integration process.\u201d\n\nRussian sanctions\n\nUkrainian President Petro Poroshenko turned to Twitter to voice his hopes that Western sanctions against Russia will be maintained.\n\n\u201cToday the current challenge for the European Union is to find a way to the hearts of Euroskeptics so as not to allow a single chance to the opponents of the Euro-integration project and to their generous sponsor,\u201d he wrote, in an apparent allusion to Moscow.\n\nMany in Ukraine are also worried that the Brexit could derail the much-awaited EU visa waiver for Ukrainian citizens.\n\nIryna Herashchenko, Parliament\u2019s vice-chair, warned that Europe will pay a \u201cheavy price\u201d for what she called \u201cthe populism and the irresponsibility of politicians.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, this will directly affect our country,\u201d she warned on Facebook. \u201cCan this delay the visa-free [regime]? Yes, unfortunately.\u201d\n\nIn eastern Ukraine, news of Britain\u2019s decision drew triumphant comments from pro-Russia separatists controlling large swaths of the region.\n\nOleksandr Zakharchenko, the leader of separatists who hold territory in the eastern Donetsk region, congratulated Britain and said he hoped the British referendum would change Europe\u2019s attitudes toward two unrecognized separatist \u201crepublics\u201d in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cBritain did what we did two years ago: we also held a referendum, voted and left Ukraine,\u201d he said. \u201cFortunately for Britain, they didn\u2019t send planes against them, they are not calling them separatists.\u201d\n\nBritain\u2019s decision to leave the EU sent similar shock waves through neighboring Moldova.\n\nPrime Minister Pavel Filip lamented what he described as \u201ca sad day for Europe,\u201d but stressed that Moldova, which signed an Association Agreement with the EU in 2014, would remain committed to joining the bloc.\n\n\u201cThe European project needs now, more than ever, to be reaffirmed and trusted,\u201d he said. \u201cMoldova will remain attached to its EU road, despite the result in the U.K., because we trust the European Union as a successful project.\u201d\n\nDiasporas\n\nThere are fears in Moldova that Britain\u2019s EU departure could lead to slashed funding for the impoverished country and affect the large Moldovan diaspora working in Britain.\n\nThe vote could also bolster support for Moldovan politicians advocating closer ties with Moscow.\n\nIgor Dodon, the leader of the opposition Socialist Party, was quick to hail the vote. The outcome, he said, showed \u201cthe EU has only a past, not a future.\u201d Mr. Dodon is currently leading in the polls ahead of Moldova\u2019s October presidential election.\n\nRenato Usatii, the head of the pro-Russian Partidul Nostru party, also praised Britain\u2019s vote and predicted the \u201cunraveling\u201d of the EU.\n\nIn Belarus, authorities remained tight-lipped about Britain\u2019s choice.\n\nBut opposition leaders voiced concerns that Britain\u2019s exit will play into the hands of the Kremlin by temporarily paralyzing Europe and depriving it of one its most virulent critics of Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s bad news for us,\u201d lamented Alyaksei Yanukevich, the head of the opposition Belarusian Popular Front. \u201cOver the next few years, Britain and other European countries will be very busy taking care of their internal affairs, they will be building a new architecture for Europe, and this means that outside the EU, most particularly in our region, the Kremlin will have more leeway.\u201d\n\nIn the other three Eastern Partnership countries \u2013 Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan \u2013 reaction to the Brexit vote was more serene.\n\n\u201cIn terms of possible political impact to Azerbaijan, the EU didn\u2019t cooperate with us so closely, so I\u2019m not expecting any impact on bilateral relations,\u201d said Rasim Musabeyov, a lawmaker in Azerbaijan\u2019s Parliament.\n\nExperts say the immediate fallout of the Brexit vote for Azerbaijan is mostly economic; the country\u2019s oil fund keeps 5 percent of its assets in Britain\u2019s currency \u2013 more than 1.1 billion British pounds.\n\nIn Georgia, Prime Minister Giorgi Kvirikashvili expressed his \u201cpersonal regret\u201d at the outcome of the British referendum but said he had \u201cno doubt\u201d the European Union will survive the blow.\n\n\u201cThis vote will not change the fact that the European Union is the most important and powerful regional political and economic union in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cIts strength will continue to grow.\u201d\n\nRFE/RL\u2019s Ukrainian, Belarusian, Moldovan, Azerbaijani, and Georgian services contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2016, RFE/RL Inc.
