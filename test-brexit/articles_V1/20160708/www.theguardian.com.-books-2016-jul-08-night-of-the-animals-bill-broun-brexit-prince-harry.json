    "text": "Bill Broun says he\u2019s \u201cweirded out\u201d when we speak just before the publication of his debut novel, Night of the Animals. It\u2019s the day after the Brexit vote, and it\u2019s not the standard first-time novelist jitters that have him rattled. As his publisher is happy to point out, Brexit is a turn of events foretold by his expansive dystopian novel, set in London in 2052. I am weirded out too, I tell him. The experience of reading his novel so soon after the vote felt a little unnerving.\n\nIn Night of the Animals, a British surveillance state is led by an alternate-universe Prince Harry. He has broken the electoral system, elevated the monarchy and doubled down on existing class divisions. In this nightmarish neoliberal dystopia, access to the NHS is granted according to class, and Britain\u2019s welfare state has disappeared under the \u201cBarenotecy Alimentation Act of 2025 and Positive Disenfranchisement Act of 2028\u201d. People classified as \u201cindigent\u201d are kept away from the so-called \u201cnew aristocracy\u201d by the Red Watch, a policing force armed with deadly \u201cneuralpikes\u201d. Meanwhile, the vanishing middle class has been subdued \u201cwith purchases of chocolate and lager\u201d, as well as \u201cjingoism, and an abiding unctuousness toward the rich\u201d.\n\nThe middle class has been subdued with 'chocolate and lager'\n\nIn case that doesn\u2019t make it clear enough, the world Broun imagines in his extraordinary debut is plagued by social and economic inequality. The novel\u2019s main character, Cuthbert, is an indigent, mentally ill drug addict. (The tipple of choice in Broun\u2019s world is a hallucinogen called Fl\u014dt.) Cuthbert perambulates London from his grim little council flat to the offices of his physician Dr Bajwa, a harried, kindly man who just wants to keep Cuthbert out of the clutches of Equipoise, the NHS\u2019s sinister \u201cpsychotherapeutic division\u201d. As a giant comet approaches Earth during a moment of mass insecurity, suicide cults have taken hold worldwide. Cuthbert begins to hear the voices of animals in the London zoo, urging him to let them free; if Equipoise discovers his hallucinations, they will inevitably subdue Cuthbert inside a personality-killing \u201cNexar hood\u201d.\n\nThis, Broun worries, may be the society of the future. \u201cThe Brexit is the kind of trigger that down the road can lead to the horror of a Night of the Animals world,\u201d he says.\n\nBroun calls his book a \u201cBritish novel with American DNA\u201d. He cites Zadie Smith, Ali Smith and Monica Ali as his favorite contemporary British writers, and says he wanted to work against what he sees as a \u201cnarrow-minded and London-centric\u201d mode in British letters. His own connection to Britain is personal and complicated. His father is a retired British machinist who married an American nurse. Broun grew up in the US, but lived in London as a young man while he attended University College London. He remembers London as an exciting place, but a \u201ca very cold\u201d one. Although the novel is fanciful (if partly prophetic), it has its roots in Broun\u2019s personal experiences. Broun was aware of a \u201cdark class consciousness at a pretty young age\u201d.\n\nView image in fullscreen Bill Broun calls his debut novel a \u2018British novel with American DNA\u2019. Photograph: Bill Broun\n\nBroun\u2019s relationship with his father is similarly complex. He says that he feels the trouble between them was connected to national differences too. His father was an emotionally distant Ameriphobe, making sure his American-living son grew up with the BBC world service, Aston Villa and giant boxes of British candy.\n\nUltimately, though, Broun\u2019s father provided a lot of source material for the novel, Broun says; the author interviewed him extensively about his childhood in Worcestershire, mining his father\u2019s memories for information about English folk ways: saints, stories and modes of speech. In addition to being a vision of our dystopian future, Night of the Animals is deeply engaged with a variety of religious traditions, but particularly with medieval English Christianity. Cuthbert\u2019s zoological hallucinations usher in the return of his medieval namesake, the so-called \u201cChrist of the Otters\u201d.\n\nCuthbert, his main character, battles addiction and mental health issues that reflect a sort of road not taken for Broun, who became an alcoholic when he was living in London. During periods of psychic distress, Broun encountered a number of older men who, like Cuthbert, were living on the streets with serious mental illness. \u201cThey taught me a great deal about heroism in the face of grave material difficulties,\u201d Broun says. Broun himself is in recovery, sober 25 years.\n\nBroun\u2019s writing career had a somewhat rocky start. For a long time he considered himself a failed writer, after a publishing deal for a book of short stories fell through. Night of the Animals was conceived from his anger over the stories\u2019 fate. \u201cI\u2019m letting the animals out of the zoo,\u201d is how Broun sums up his feelings at the time. The novel would take Broun 14 years to write.\n\nMeanwhile, Broun married and had a son, and got a job as an associate professor at East Stroudsburg University in Pennsylvania. His students, who are mostly first-generation college students, inspire him. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to feel sorry for yourself when you\u2019re teaching young people who are working two jobs and trying to raise a family while going through college.\u201d\n\n\n\nBroun was encouraged in his writing by his literary fairy godmother, the novelist Mary Gaitskill, who he first met while studying for an master\u2019s degree at the University of Houston in the late 1990s. Broun helped Gaitskill learn how to drive, and regularly drove the author to the Whole Foods so she could buy groceries. She repaid him by believing in his work, and needling him to finish the book. Broun calls Giatskill \u201cincredibly generous\u201d.\n\nHe credits Gaitskill, along with his wife Annmarie Drury, a scholar of Victorian literature and poet, for helping him. \u201cFor years I just felt utter hopelessness. For years I thought: \u2018I hate this fucking novel. I hate fucking writing it. I hate that everyone wants me to keep writing it and I wish they would all just fuck off.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe end result seems to have been worth it. Broun\u2019s novel feels eerily adept at predicting the technologies that will characterize the next few decades: characters communicate using \u201cSkinWerks\u201d, a \u201cbioelectric emollient sprayed onto the epidermis\u201d that allows \u201cwearers to read and type upon their own skin \u2026 to exchange tactile sensations, and to display digital images\u201d. But it is above all a messianic story, culminating in a denouement that combines Cuthbert\u2019s hallucinations, the coming comet and a miracle.\n\nIn a similarly millenarian spirit, I ask Broun if he feels like we\u2019re doomed after Brexit. \u201cCategorically, no,\u201d he says.\n\nBroun believes there will be some kind of redemption. Animals have a role, he thinks. \u201cI\u2019m not like, \u2018I can\u2019t wait to till the rapture comes,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cBut I see a kind of new, green world. It\u2019s connected to god and it\u2019s connected to animals. I don\u2019t understand how. But I know it.\u201d",
