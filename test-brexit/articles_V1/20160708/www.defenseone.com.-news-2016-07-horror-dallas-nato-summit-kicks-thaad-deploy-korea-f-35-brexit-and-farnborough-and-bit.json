    "text": "Gunmen kill four police officers in Dallas: \u201cThis is a nightmare: The nightmare of a terrorist attack at a peaceful, familiar street intersection where we have all been a thousand times,\u201d wrote Dallas Morning News columnist Jacquielynn Floyd early this morning. She was writing, of course, about this: \u201cTwo snipers shot and killed four Dallas police officers and a DART officer Thursday night during a protest downtown. Seven other officers and two civilians were wounded in a coordinated attack during the demonstration against recent shootings of black men by police in Louisiana and Minnesota.\u201d (Read continuing coverage of the attack from the Morning News, here.)\n\nContinued Floyd: \u201cThis is terrorism. This is what terrorists do. It isn\u2019t a war \u2014 not black against blue, or us against them. When a reported two gunmen opened fire Thursday night on police officers, on our police officers, they attacked us all.\u201d\n\nBrexit casts its shadow on NATO Summit. USA Today: \u201cPresident Obama and leaders of the European Union tried to put to rest any concerns that the United Kingdom\u2019s Brexit referendum would lead to further disintegration in Europe Friday, as they kicked off a two-day summit of NATO leaders. Obama said the summit comes \u2018at a critical moment for the European Union,\" with some suggesting that \"the entire edifice of European security and prosperity is crumbling.\u2019 Those concerns, Obama said, are misplaced and hyperbolic.\u201d\n\nOthers added their own reassurances. Writing in Defense One, the UK ambassador to the United States said. \u201cThe UK has the world\u2019s fifth-largest defense budget. We are \u2013 and will continue to be \u2013 leading members of NATO, the G7, G20, and the Commonwealth, and permanent members of the UN Security Council, the only country in all of these groups which spends 2 percent of its GDP on defense and 0.7 percent on development assistance. Following our Strategic Defence and Security Review last year, we are investing $250 billion over the next decade in modern and capable Armed Forces.\u201d Read that, here.\n\nWhat\u2019s on the table in Warsaw? Nothing less than the most important decisions in 25 years, according to Ivo Daalder, a former U.S. ambassador to NATO. \u201cThe task of NATO leaders is to put in place policies and processes that respond to this triple challenge to Europe\u2019s security in ways that are clearly understood by the alliance\u2019s adversaries and supported by increasingly restive publics on both sides of the Atlantic. It is a tall task, indeed.\u201d Details here.\n\nBut can NATO\u2019s members come together? \u201cWhat are countries looking for from Warsaw? Unsurprisingly, many nations are going in with their own agendas, driven primarily by regional focuses,\u201d writes Defense News. \u201cNorway, for example, is looking for a focus on the High North region of Europe that could be imperiled by Russian naval forces\u2026\u201d Read on, here.\n\nICYMI: From the Council on Foreign Relations\u2019 Jonathan Masters, a guide to the Cold-War alliance under pressure as it transforms itself for 21st-century challenges, here.\n\nFrom Defense One\n\nWhat presidents do when naval encounters turn deadly? Three incidents that shook the nation hold lessons for future commanders-in-chief, writes Douglas Peifer of the U.S. Air Force\u2019s Air War College. Learn those, here.\n\nPanel: Overhaul veterans care by working with more private-sector firms. The Commission on Care's final report declines to recommend stripping the Veterans Health Administration of its status as a government agency. Via GovExec, here.\n\nWelcome to the Friday edition of The D Brief by Bradley Peniston. On this day in 1709, Russia defeats Sweden at the Battle of Poltava, forever shifting the region\u2019s balance of power. Send your friends this link: http://get.defenseone.com/d-brief/. And let us know your news: the-d-brief@defenseone.com.\n\nU.S. will deploy THAAD to South Korea. Pentagon officials made the announcement last night, Defense News reports. The officials stressed that the anti-missile system is being sent in reaction to North Korea, which has been issuing threats and conducting ever-more advanced weapons tests. In effect, they all but screamed \u201cChina, this isn\u2019t about you.\u201d\n\nBut that\u2019s not likely to wash in Beijing. Why? As Elbridge Colby of the Center for a New American Security sees it, China dislikes THAAD\u2019s missiles but hates its radar, which could track PLA launches. Beijing sees THAAD as a threat to its retaliatory capacity, and therefore, a reason to start building more nukes. So this decision to beef up defenses against NorK has the potential to destabilize the nuclear balance with China. Read more, here.\n\nAnd here\u2019s more on \u201cThe US Missile System Driving a Wedge Between China, South Korea.\u201d\n\nBrexit fears loom as U.K. airshows begin. The long-awaited debut of the F-35 in the U.K. has collided with the economic instability fears following Britons\u2019 vote to leave the European Union. \u201cI think much of this lies ahead of us as to actually what the impact will be,\u201d Jeff Babione, executive vice president and general manager of the F-35 program for Lockheed Martin, said Thursday. Defense One\u2019s Global Business Editor Marcus Weisgerber breaks down what to expect at the Farnborough Air Show. More here.\n\nThis week, however, there's the Royal International Air Tattoo, one of the world\u2019s largest military air shows that officially opened this morning. Defense One got a sneak peek Thursday as many of the planes arrived at RIAT (pronounced ree-ott). Check out some of his pictures, here.\n\nWhen will the Air Force\u2019s F-35 be ready for battle? Gen. Herbert \u201cHawk\u201d Carlisle, head of Air Combat Command who will make that decision, gave a whole lot of clues for when he\u2019ll declare the Joint Strike Fighter war ready during an international media day hosted by the plane-maker Lockheed Martin at RIAT. The Air Force has said the plane will be battle ready between August and December. \u201cI personally believe that we\u2019re going to be able to declare IOC at the leading edge of that window,\u201d Carlisle said. \u201cSo as we look at things, we\u2019re getting close.\u201d More here.\n\nAmong the F-35 criticisms is: can it dogfight? \u201cIt handles the way we want it to handle,\u201d said Maj. Will Andreotta, a U.S. Air Force F-35 pilot and commander of the Lightning II Heritage Flight Team. \u201cThe whole idea of stealth and when an aircraft is optimized for stealth is that we are never seen,\u201d he said. \u201cBut with that being said, if we do get in a dogfight, I have complete confidence in this aircraft \u2026 and the pilots that we have flying those aircraft.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s now shift to the F-22 Raptor, which of course is here too. It flew its practice run yesterday, its roaring engines prompting F-35 pilots to occasionally pause their discussion with reporters in a tent next to the flightline. Congress has asked to Air Force to reconsider what it would take to build more of the stealthy jets. In April, we told you it would take a lot to restart production, which was halted in 2012. Since then, many of the jet\u2019s subcontractors have \u201cgone on to other things,\u201d Carlisle said. \u201cThe F-22 is a fantastic airplane, but getting that back up to speed with all the sub[contractors] could potentially be a challenge,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s very much a personal opinion.\u201d The Air Force could better spend its money on upping the rate at which it buys the F-35 and beginning to look at what a next-generation \u201cpenetrating counter-air capability\u201d looks like.",
