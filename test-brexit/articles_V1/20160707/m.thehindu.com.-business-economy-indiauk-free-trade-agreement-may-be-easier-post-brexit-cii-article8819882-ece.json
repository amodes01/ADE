    "text": "A Free Trade Agreement between India and the UK could be easier to accomplish at a bilateral level following Britain\u2019s exit from the EU, according to Indian industry leaders.\n\nThe Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) led its annual delegation to London this week to take stock of \u2018The Future of UK-India Economic Relations\u2019 and said there was general consensus that Brexit opened up the possibility of new opportunities.\n\n\u201cWith Britain\u2019s departure from the EU, India will have to negotiate a Free Trade Agreement with the UK which may be easier to accomplish at a bilateral level... This could well be the best era for our industries to collaborate,\u201d CII Director-General Chandrajit Banerjee said, adding that there was \u201cpolitical drive and willingness\u201d on both the sides.\n\nHis views were echoed by CII President Naushad Forbes, co-chairman of Forbes Marshall Private Limited.\n\n\u201cIndia-UK relations will sustain with or without Britain\u2019s relationship with the EU and will only thrive and prosper in the years ahead,\u201d Forbes said.\n\nPointing out that India had been negotiating an FTA with the EU for over nine years and had been stuck in a couple of areas of concern for India, he said, \u201cMany of these issues will instantly go away between India and the UK. It would be an agreement that would be almost made in heaven\u201c.\n\nUK Minister of State for Universities and Science Jo Johnson said such a bilateral agreement would be on the agenda and sought to reassure Indian industry leaders against any fears over the business climate in the UK following Brexit.\n\n\u201cWe have so many strengths in our bilateral relationship, on which we must now rapidly build... It has been very frustrating that the EU-India FTA has been so slow in making progress and has suffered several pauses. I sincerely hope that tighter bilateral trade agreement between the UK and India can make rapid progress,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI want to reassure you about any uncertainty as the UK enters a new phase of its relationship with the EU... more than ever we are going to be an outward looking, adventurous, optimistic country,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nIndian High Commissioner to the UK Navtej Sarna said the political underpinning for the economic relationship between India and the UK was strong and that uncertainties should not have any adverse effect as business \u201cthrives of uncertainties\u201d and a \u201cplanned roadmap\u201d for the relationship already exists.",
