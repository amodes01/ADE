    "text": "NATO Deputy Secretary General Vershbow said Brexit may make the military Alliance more important for the UK\n\nThe British vote to leave the European Union will have minimal impact on the United Kingdom\u2019s role in NATO; it could, in fact, enhance the Alliance\u2019s importance as a forum at which to address global challenges, NATO Deputy Secretary General Alexander Vershbow said in Warsaw on July 7.\n\n\u201cThe British are going out of their way to stress that Britain\u2019s status within NATO is unaffected by Brexit,\u201d said Vershbow, \u201cthat is a fact.\u201d\n\nDescribing the United Kingdom as a mainstay of the twenty-eight-member Alliance, Vershbow said that \u201cif anything, for the UK, NATO clearly becomes more important if they go through with Brexit.\u201d\n\n\u201cNATO itself, as a forum, may become more important because this will be the place where we can address these fundamental challenges that we have to deal with over the coming years,\u201d he added.\n\n\n\nVershbow spoke at the Atlantic Council\u2019s NATO Future Leaders Summit in Warsaw. He was joined in a panel discussion by Douglas Lute, the US permanent representative to NATO, and Alexandra de Hoop Scheffer, a senior transatlantic fellow at the German Marshall Fund. Damon Wilson, executive vice president for programs and strategy at the Atlantic Council, moderated the discussion. The conference was held a day before NATO leaders were to meet for their two-day summit in the Polish capital.\n\nIn a June 23 referendum, British voters backed a UK departure from the European Union, a so-called Brexit, by 52 percent to 49 percent. The results of the vote are nonbinding. Brexit negotiations with Brussels will only officially start once the British prime minister informs the European Council of the decision to leave the EU\u2014thereby invoking Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. British Prime Minister David Cameron, who has announced his decision to step down in October, has said he will leave that invocation to his successor.\n\nVershbow acknowledged that if Brexit negotiations turn \u201cdivisive\u201d and \u201crancorous\u201d it would have some spillover onto deliberations in NATO. \u201c[NATO] Secretary General [Jens Stoltenberg] is certainly trying to underscore that if anything, NATO is now important than ever and that our unity and solidarity will have to sustain us through what will clearly be a difficult period for Europe,\u201d he said.\n\nThe UK and NATO\n\nThe UK is a significant contributor to NATO. It is one of five NATO member states that meets the goal of contributing two percent of its GDP to defense.\n\nLute noted that \u201celements of continuity\u201d\u2014the US relationship with the UK, the US relationship with the EU, and the UK\u2019s contributions to NATO\u2014would remain even if the UK were to leave the European bloc. \u201cThose are cornerstones that remain,\u201d said Lute.\n\n\u201cClearly, inside the halls of NATO, the UK is a leader, it leads with its capabilities and we don\u2019t expect that to change,\u201d he added.\n\nDe Hoop Scheffer noted that while the vote for Brexit sends a troubling political message to other EU members states, it would have the minimal impact on the \u201cdefense domain\u201d as bilateral defense cooperation\u2014such as the Lancaster House Agreement between the UK and France\u2014will continue.\n\nIn fact, the EU Global Strategy document rolled out in June advocates that Europe needs to develop its own military autonomy. \u201cWhen it comes to collective defense, NATO remains the primary framework for most member states\u201d but \u201cas Europeans we must take greater responsibility for our security,\u201d according to the document from EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini.\n\nLute said it was good news if EU member states wish to contribute to their own defense, but, he added the caveat, \u201cautonomy opens the door\u2026for duplication and inefficiency.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is simply not enough defense investment for duplicate structures,\u201d said Lute. \u201cIf we can work this in a way that we compliment and reinforce one another then the US will be the strongest advocate of this, but we are going to be very sharply watching anything that looks like duplication.\u201d\n\nHe cited NATO\u2019s command structure as an example. \u201cWe don\u2019t believe that Europe needs a separate command structure just like that into which we pour several thousand people, untold euros, only to duplicate the structure that has been so well tried and true in NATO,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, we can\u2019t simply hunker down and burrow into our own self-defense. Security for NATO starts with stability beyond NATO and that\u2019s why projecting stability is so important,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Warsaw Summit\n\nNATO leaders will meet in Warsaw on July 8 and 9. The summit takes place at a time when Europe is facing challenges from a migrant crisis on its south, a revanchist Russia to its east, and the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) or Daesh that has claimed responsibility for terrorist attacks in Paris, Brussels, and Istanbul.\n\nRussia \u201ctore up the international rulebook\u201d and \u201cchallenged our vision of a Europe whole, free, and at peace\u201d when it annexed Crimea in March of 2014, said Vershbow.\n\n\u201cNATO has shown that it is very adaptable\u2026we need some serious adaptation again,\u201d he added. \u201cWarsaw gives us the opportunity to think about the long term. We now sadly recognize that we are in a long-term strategic competition with Russia.\u201d\n\nThe Warsaw Summit is expected to send a message of deterrence and defense.\n\nAt NATO\u2019s Wales Summit in 2014, Alliance member states agreed to enhance the capabilities of the NATO Response Force (NRF) in order to respond to challenges from Russia and the Middle East and North Africa. This force\u2014the Very High Readiness Joint Task Force (VJTF)\u2014 met its intended air, sea, and land deployment goals during NATO\u2019s Exercise \u201cBrilliant Jump\u201d in which 2,500 allied troops deployed from across Europe into Poland in May.\n\n\u201cFor NATO, it is a back to basics\u201d when it comes to deterrence, said Lute, \u201cbut it is not a return to the Cold War.\u201d\n\nThe VJTF\u2019s rapid reaction capability will be complimented with a forward presence. \u201cThis forward presence literally will begin in the north in Estonia and it will end up in the south in Bulgaria,\u201d said Lute.\n\nAn Atlantic Council report, \u201cRestoring the Power and Purpose of the NATO Alliance,\u201d urges NATO to permanently station troops in the Baltic States, Poland, and the Black Sea region. R. Nicholas Burns, an Atlantic Council board member who served as under secretary of state in the George W. Bush administration, and retired Gen. James L. Jones, Jr., chairman of the Atlantic Council\u2019s Brent Scowcroft Center on International Security and a former national security advisor in the Obama administration, are the authors of the report.\n\nNATO plans to deploy four combat battalions in Poland and the three Baltic States: Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. The United States will lead the NATO battalion in Poland.\n\nIn May, US military officials inaugurated a missile interceptor site in Romania, which will be part of a larger missile defense shield. Romania will also host a multinational NATO brigade.\n\nIn June, NATO conducted a series of major military exercises\u2014known collectively as Anakonda-2016\u2014in Poland and a separate exercise\u2014BALTOPS\u2014in the Baltic Sea.\n\nFor the first time in NATO\u2019s history there will be a \u201csubstantial combat-ready capability forward across the eastern flank of the Alliance,\u201d said Lute.\n\nDiffering threat perceptions\n\nNot all NATO member states view the challenges facing Europe in the same order of priority. France, for instance, is more concerned about terrorism in the wake of the attacks in Paris in November of 2015 than the threat posed by Russia, said De Hoop Scheffer.\n\n\u201cYou cannot expect France to share the same sense of urgency when it comes to Russia [as] Poland or the Baltic States,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd you cannot ask the Baltic States or Poland to be as involved as we are in the south to face the crisis of Daesh, but that does not mean that we do not share a sense of unity of purpose.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can be divided when it comes to our own security and defense priorities, but we have to keep the Alliance as united as possible,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe more important than the military aspect of the Alliance is the political aspect of the Alliance.\u201d\n\nThe leaders of Ukraine and Afghanistan will be among those present at NATO\u2019s Warsaw Summit. US President Barack Obama announced on July 6 that he will leave 8,400 US troops in Afghanistan when he leaves office next year. That number is up from the 5,500 he had originally pledged to leave in the country.\n\nAt Warsaw, NATO leaders will look for ways in which the Alliance can supplement, not supplant, the US-led coalition\u2019s effort against ISIS and the EU\u2019s attempts to contain the migrant crisis that has been fueled by conflict across the Middle East and North Africa, particularly in Syria, Iraq, and Afghanistan.\n\n\u201cThe key is to complement, not compete,\u201d said Lute.\n\n\n\nAshish Kumar Sen is deputy director, editorial, at the Atlantic Council.
