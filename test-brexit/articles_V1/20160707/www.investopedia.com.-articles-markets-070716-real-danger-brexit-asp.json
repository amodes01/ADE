Treasury analysis: The long-term economic impact of EU membership and the alternatives,\u201d April 2016\n\nLeave supporters discounted such economic projections under the label \u201cProject Fear.\u201d A pro-Brexit outfit associated with the U.K. Independence Party (UKIP), which was founded to oppose EU membership, responded by saying that the Treasury\u2019s \u201cworst-case scenario of \u00a34,300 per household is a bargain-basement price for the restoration of national independence and safe, secure borders.\u201d\n\nAlthough Leave supporters stressed issues of national pride, safety, and sovereignty, they also mustered economic arguments. For example, Johnson said on the eve of the vote, \u201cEU politicians would be banging down the door for a trade deal\u201d the day after the vote, in light of their \u201ccommercial interests.\u201d\n\nVote Leave, the official pro-Brexit campaign, topped the \u201cWhy Vote Leave\u201d page on its website with the claim that the U.K. could save \u00a3350 million per week: \u201cWe can spend our money on our priorities like the NHS [National Health Service], schools, and housing.\u201d\n\nIn May 2016, the U.K. Statistics Authority, an independent public body, said the figure was gross rather than net, which was \u201cmisleading and undermines trust in official statistics.\u201d A mid-June poll by Ipsos MORI, however, found that 47% of the country believed the claim.\n\nThe day after the referendum, Nigel Farage, who co-founded UKIP and led it until that November, disavowed the figure and said that he was not closely associated with Vote Leave. May also declined to confirm Vote Leave\u2019s NHS promises since taking office.\n\nBrexit Economic Response\n\nThough Britain officially left the EU, 2020 was a transition and implementation period. Trade and customs continued during that time, so there wasn\u2019t much on a day-to-day basis that seemed different to U.K. residents. Even so, the decision to leave the EU had an effect on Britain\u2019s economy.\n\nThe country\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth slowed down to around 1.4% in 2018 from 1.9% in 2016 and 2.7% in 2017 as business investment slumped. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicted that the country\u2019s economy would grow at 1.3% in 2019 and 1.4% in 2020. Instead, growth was 1.6% in 2019 but -10.4% in 2020. GDP rebounded, however, touching 8.7% in 2021 before slowing to 4.3% in 2022.\n\nThe U.K. unemployment rate hit a 44-year low at 3.9% in the three months leading up to January 2019. Experts attribute this to employers preferring to retain workers instead of investing in new major projects.\n\nWhile the fall in the value of the pound after the Brexit vote helped exporters, the higher price of imports was passed onto consumers and had a significant impact on the annual inflation rate. Consumer Prices Index (CPI) inflation hit 3.1% in the 12 months leading up to November 2017, a nearly six-year high that well exceeded the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target. Inflation fell in 2018 with the decline in oil and gas prices but soared after the global COVID-19 pandemic, rising 8.7% in the 12 months preceding April 2023.\n\nA July 2017 report by the House of Lords cited evidence that U.K. businesses would have to raise wages to attract native-born workers following Brexit, which was \u201clikely to lead to higher prices for consumers.\u201d\n\nInternational trade was expected to fall due to Brexit, even with the possibility of a raft of free trade deals. Dr. Monique Ebell, former associate research director at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, forecasted a -22% reduction in total U.K. goods and services trade if EU membership was replaced by a free trade agreement.\n\nOther free trade agreements were not predicted to pick up the slack. In fact, Ebell saw a pact with the BRIICS (Brazil, Russia, India, Indonesia, China, and South Africa) boosting total trade by 2.2% while a pact with the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand was expected to do slightly better, at 2.6%.\n\n\u201cThe single market is a very deep and comprehensive trade agreement aimed at reducing non-tariff barriers,\u201d Ebell wrote in January 2017, \u201cwhile most non-EU [free trade agreements] seem to be quite ineffective at reducing the non-tariff barriers that are important for services trade.\u201d\n\nJune 2017 General Election\n\nOn April 18, May called for a snap election to be held on June 8, despite previous promises not to hold one until 2020. Polling at the time suggested May would expand on her slim Parliament majority of 330 seats (there are 650 seats in the Commons). Labour gained rapidly in the polls, however, aided by an embarrassing Tory flip-flop on a proposal for estates to fund end-of-life care.\n\nThe Conservatives lost their majority, winning 318 seats to Labour\u2019s 262. The Scottish National Party won 35, with other parties taking 35. The resulting hung Parliament cast doubts on May\u2019s mandate to negotiate Brexit and led the leaders of Labour and the Liberal Democrats to call on May to resign.\n\nSpeaking in front of the prime minister\u2019s residence at 10 Downing Street, May batted away calls for her to leave her post, saying, \u201cIt is clear that only the Conservative and Unionist Party\u201d\u2014the Tories\u2019 official name\u2014\u201chas the legitimacy and ability to provide that certainty by commanding a majority in the House of Commons.\u201d The Conservatives struck a deal with the Democratic Unionist Party of Northern Ireland, which won 10 seats, to form a coalition.\n\nMay presented the election as a chance for the Conservatives to solidify their mandate and strengthen their negotiating position with Brussels. But this backfired.\n\nIn the wake of the election, many expected the government\u2019s Brexit position to soften, and they were right. May released a Brexit white paper in July 2018 that mentioned an \u201cassociation agreement\u201d and a free-trade area for goods with the EU. David Davis resigned as Brexit secretary, and Boris Johnson resigned as Foreign Secretary in protest.\n\nBut the election also increased the possibility of a no-deal Brexit. The Financial Times predicted that the result made May more vulnerable to pressure from Euroskeptics and her coalition partners. This was evident with the Irish backstop tussle.\n\nWith her position weakened, May struggled to unite her party behind her deal and keep control of Brexit.\n\nScotland\u2019s Independence Referendum\n\nPoliticians in Scotland pushed for a second independence referendum in the wake of the Brexit vote, but the results of the June 8, 2017, election cast a pall over their efforts. The Scottish National Party (SNP) lost 21 seats in the Westminster Parliament, and on June 27, 2017, Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said her government at Holyrood would \u201creset\u201d its timetable on independence to focus on delivering a \u201csoft Brexit.\u201d\n\nNot one Scottish local area voted to leave the EU, according to the U.K.\u2019s Electoral Commission, though Moray came close at 49.9%. The country as a whole rejected the referendum by 62.0% to 38.0%.\n\nBut because Scotland only contains 8.4% of the U.K.\u2019s population, its vote to Remain (along with that of Northern Ireland, which accounts for just 2.8% of the U.K.\u2019s population) was vastly outweighed by support for Brexit in England and Wales.\n\nScotland joined England and Wales to form Great Britain in 1707, and the relationship has been tumultuous at times. The SNP, which was founded in the 1930s, had just six of 650 seats in Westminster in 2010. The following year, however, it formed a majority government in the devolved Scottish Parliament at Holyrood, partly owing to its promise to hold a referendum on Scottish independence.\n\n2014 Scottish Independence Referendum\n\nThat referendum, held in 2014, saw the pro-independence side lose with 44.7% of the vote. Turnout was 84.6%. Far from putting the independence issue to rest, though, the vote fired up nationalist support.\n\nThe SNP won 56 of 59 Scottish seats at Westminster the following year, overtaking the Liberal Democrats to become the third-largest party in the U.K. overall. Britain\u2019s electoral map suddenly showed a glaring divide between England and Wales, which was dominated by Tory blue with the occasional patch of Labour red, and all-yellow Scotland.\n\nWhen Britain voted to leave the EU, Scotland fulminated. A combination of rising nationalism and strong support for Europe led almost immediately to calls for a new independence referendum. In 2017, when the Supreme Court ruled that devolved national assemblies such as Scotland\u2019s parliament could not veto Brexit, the demands grew louder.\n\nOn March 13 of that year, Sturgeon called for a second referendum to be held in the autumn of 2018 or spring of 2019. Holyrood backed her by a vote of 69 to 59 on March 28, the day before May\u2019s government triggered Article 50.\n\nSturgeon\u2019s preferred timing was significant since the two-year countdown initiated by Article 50 ended in the spring of 2019 when the politics surrounding Brexit could be particularly volatile.\n\nWhat Would Independence Look Like?\n\nScotland\u2019s economic situation also raised questions about its hypothetical future as an independent country. The crash in oil prices dealt a blow to government finances. In May 2014, its government forecasted 2015\u20132016 tax receipts from North Sea drilling of \u00a33.4 billion to \u00a39 billion but only collected \u00a360 million, less than 1% of the forecasts\u2019 midpoint.\n\nIn reality, these figures were hypothetical since Scotland\u2019s finances were not (and are not) fully devolved, but the estimates were based on the country\u2019s geographical share of North Sea drilling, so they illustrated what it might expect as an independent nation.\n\nThe debate over what currency an independent Scotland would use was revived. Former SNP leader Alex Salmond, who was Scotland\u2019s First Minister until November 2014, told the Financial Times that the country could abandon the pound and introduce its own currency, allowing it to float freely or pegging it to sterling. He ruled out joining the euro, but others contended that it would be required for Scotland to join the EU. Another possibility would be to use the pound, which would mean forfeiting control over monetary policy.\n\nUpsides for Some\n\nOn the other hand, a weak currency that floats on global markets can be a boon to U.K. producers that export goods. Industries that rely heavily on exports could actually see some benefit.\n\nIn 2024, the top 10 exports from the U.K. were (in U.S. dollars):\n\nPrecious metals: $63.5 billion Motor vehicle manufacturing: $28.8 Aircraft, engines, and parts manufacturing: $27.4 billion Petroleum refining: $21.4 billion Pharmaceuticals preparations manufacturing: $15.4 billion Crude petroleum and natural gas extraction: $12.8 billion Off-road vehicle manufacturing: $8.9 billion Measuring, testing, and navigational equipment manufacturing: $8.4 billion Spirit Production: $6.9 billion\n\nWhiskey production: $5.8 billion\n\nSome sectors were prepared to benefit from the exit. Multinationals listed on the FTSE 100 saw earnings rise as a result of a soft pound. A weak currency was also a boon to the tourism, energy, and service industries.\n\nIn May 2016, the State Bank of India, India\u2019s largest commercial bank, suggested that Brexit would benefit India economically. While leaving the eurozone meant that the U.K. no longer had unfettered access to Europe\u2019s single market, it would allow for more focus on trade with India. India would also have more wiggle room if the U.K. were no longer under European trade rules and regulations.\n\nU.K.-EU Trade After Brexit\n\nMay advocated a \u201chard Brexit.\u201d By that, she meant that Britain should leave the EU\u2019s single market and customs union and negotiate a trade deal to govern their future relationship. These negotiations would have been conducted during a transition period once a divorce deal was ratified.\n\nThe Conservatives\u2019 poor showing in the June 2017 snap election called popular support for a hard Brexit into question. Many in the press speculated that the government could take a softer line. The Brexit White Paper released in July 2018 revealed plans for a softer Brexit. It was too soft for many MPs in her party and too audacious for the EU.\n\nThe white paper said the government planned to leave the EU single market and customs union. However, it proposed the creation of a free trade area for goods, which would \u201cavoid the need for customs and regulatory checks at the border and mean that businesses would not need to complete costly customs declarations. And it would enable products to only undergo one set of approvals and authorizations in either market, before being sold in both.\u201d This meant the U.K. would follow EU single-market rules regarding goods.\n\nThe white paper acknowledged that a borderless customs arrangement with the EU\u2014one that allowed the U.K. to negotiate free trade agreements with third countries\u2014was \u201cbroader in scope than any other that exists between the EU and a third country.\u201d\n\nThe government was correct that there was no example of this kind of relationship in Europe. The four broad precedents that existed were the EU\u2019s relationship with Norway, Switzerland, Canada, and WTO members.\n\nThe Norway Model: Join the EEA\n\nThe first option was for the U.K. to join Norway, Iceland, and Lichtenstein in the European Economic Area (EEA), which provides access to the EU\u2019s single market for most goods and services (agriculture and fisheries are excluded). At the same time, the EEA is outside the customs union, so Britain could have entered into trade deals with non-EU countries.\n\nBut the arrangement was hardly a win-win. The U.K. would be bound by some EU laws while losing its ability to influence those laws through the country\u2019s European Council and European Parliament voting rights. In September 2017, May called this arrangement an unacceptable \u201closs of democratic control.\u201d\n\nDavid Davis expressed interest in the Norway model in response to a question he received at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in Washington. \u201cIt\u2019s something we\u2019ve thought about, but it\u2019s not at the top of our list,\u201d he said. He was referring specifically to the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), which, like the EEA, offers access to the single market but not the customs union.\n\nThe EFTA was once a large organization, but most of its members left to join the EU. Today, it comprises Norway, Iceland, Lichtenstein, and Switzerland; all but Switzerland are also members of the EEA.\n\nThe Switzerland Model\n\nSwitzerland\u2019s relationship with the EU, which is governed by around 20 major bilateral pacts with the bloc, is broadly similar to the EEA arrangement. Along with these three, Switzerland is a member of the European Free Trade Association. Switzerland helped set up the EEA, but its people rejected membership in a 1992 referendum.\n\nThe country allows the free movement of people and is a member of the passport-free Schengen Area. It is subject to many single-market rules without having much say in making them.\n\nIt is outside the customs union, allowing it to negotiate free trade agreements with third countries; usually, but not always, it has negotiated alongside the EEA countries. Switzerland has access to the single market for goods (with the exception of agriculture) but not services (except insurance). It pays a modest amount into the EU\u2019s budget.\n\nBrexit supporters who wanted to \u201ctake back control\u201d wouldn\u2019t have embraced the concessions that the Swiss made on immigration, budget payments, and single-market rules. The EU would probably not have wanted a relationship modeled on the Swiss example, either: Switzerland\u2019s membership in the EFTA but not the EEA, and Schengen but not the EU, is a messy product of the complex history of European integration and\u2014not surprisingly\u2014a referendum.\n\nThe Canada Model: A Free Trade Agreement\n\nA third option was to negotiate a free trade agreement with the EU along the lines of the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA), a pact that the EU finalized but didn\u2019t fully ratify with Canada. The most obvious problem with this approach is that the U.K. had only two years from triggering Article 50 to negotiate such a deal. The EU refused to discuss a future trading relationship until December of that year at the earliest.\n\nTo give a sense of how tight that timetable was, CETA negotiations began in 2009 and concluded in 2014. But just over half of the EU\u2019s 28 national parliaments ratified the deal. Even subnational legislatures can stand in the way of a deal; the Walloon regional parliament, which represents fewer than four million mainly French-speaking Belgians, single-handedly blocked CETA for a few days in 2016.\n\nTo extend the two-year deadline for leaving the EU, Britain needed unanimous approval from the EU. Several U.K. politicians, including Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond, stressed the need for a transitional deal of a few years so that (among other reasons) Britain could negotiate EU and third-country trade deals. But this notion was met with resistance from hardline Brexiteers.\n\nAs of 2024, all EU member countries have signed the agreement yet some still need to ratify it, a process that can take two to five years.\n\nProblems With a CETA-Style Agreement\n\nIn some ways, comparing Britain\u2019s situation to Canada\u2019s is misleading. Canada already enjoys free trade with the U.S. through the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which was built on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). This means that a trade deal with the EU was not as crucial as it is for the U.K. Canada\u2019s and Britain\u2019s economies are also very different\u2014CETA does not include financial services, one of Britain\u2019s biggest exports to the EU.\n\nSpeaking in Florence, Italy, in September 2017, May said the U.K. and EU \u201ccan do so much better\u201d than a CETA-style trade agreement since they were beginning from the \u201cunprecedented position\u201d of sharing a body of rules and regulations. She did not elaborate on what \u201cmuch better\u201d looked like besides calling on both parties to be \u201ccreative as well as practical.\u201d\n\nMonique Ebell, formerly of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, stressed that even with an agreement in place, non-tariff barriers were likely to be a significant drag on Britain\u2019s trade with the EU. She expected total U.K. foreign trade\u2014not just flows to and from the EU\u2014under an EU-U.K. trade pact. She reasoned that free trade deals did not generally handle services trade well. Services are a major component of Britain\u2019s international trade; the country enjoys a trade surplus in that segment, which is not the case for goods.\n\nFree trade deals also struggle to rein in non-tariff barriers. Admittedly, Britain and the EU started from a unified regulatory scheme, but divergences would only multiply post-Brexit.\n\nWTO: Go It Alone\n\nIf Britain and the EU weren\u2019t able to agree their relationship, they would have had to revert to WTO terms. But this default solution wouldn\u2019t have been straightforward, either. Since Britain was a WTO member through the EU, it would have to split tariff schedules with the bloc and divvy out liabilities arising from ongoing trade disputes.\n\nTrading with the EU on WTO terms was the \u201cno-deal\u201d scenario that the Conservative government presented as an acceptable fallback, though most observers see this as a negotiating tactic. In July 2017, U.K. Secretary of State for International Trade Liam Fox said, \u201cPeople talk about the WTO as if it would be the end of the world. But they forget that is how they currently trade with the United States, with China, with Japan, with India, with the Gulf, and our trading relationship is strong and healthy.\u201d\n\nBut for certain industries, the EU\u2019s external tariff would have hit hard: Britain exports 78.6% of the cars it manufactures, and 60% of these go to Europe. The EU levies 10% tariffs on imported cars. Monique Ebell of the NIESR estimated that leaving the EU single market would reduce overall U.K. goods and services trade\u2014not just that with the EU\u2014by 22% to 30%.\n\nNor would the U.K. only be giving up its trade arrangements with the EU; under any of the scenarios above, it would probably have lost the trade agreements that the bloc struck with 63 developing countries, as well as progress in negotiating other deals. Replacing these and adding new ones would have been an uncertain prospect. In a September 2017 interview with Politico, Fox said his trade office, which was formed in July 2016, turned away some developing countries looking to negotiate free trade deals because it lacked the capacity to negotiate.\n\nFox wanted to roll the terms of existing EU trade deals over into new agreements, but some countries were unwilling to give Britain (66 million people, $2.6 trillion GDP) the same terms as the EU (excluding Britain, around 440 million people, $13.9 trillion GDP).\n\nImpact on the U.S.\n\nCompanies in the U.S. across a wide variety of sectors have made large investments in the U.K. over many years. The U.S. hires a lot of Brits, making U.S. companies one of the U.K.\u2019s largest job markets. The output of U.S. affiliates in the United Kingdom was $129.3 billion in 2021.\n\nThe United Kingdom plays a vital role in corporate America\u2019s global infrastructure, from assets under management (AUM) to international sales and research and development (R&D) advancements.\n\nAmerican companies have viewed Britain as a strategic gateway to other countries in the European Union. Brexit is believed to jeopardize the affiliate earnings and stock prices of many companies strategically aligned with the United Kingdom.\n\nAmerican companies and investors that have exposure to European banks and credit markets may be affected by credit risk. European banks may have to replace $123 billion in securities depending on how the exit unfolds. Furthermore, U.K. debt may not be included in European banks\u2019 emergency cash reserves, creating liquidity problems. European asset-backed securities have been in decline since 2008.\n\nWho\u2019s Next to Leave the EU?\n\nPolitical wrangling over the EU wasn\u2019t limited to Britain. Even following Britain\u2019s departure, most EU members had strong Euroskeptic movements that, while they struggled to win power at the national level, heavily influenced the tenor of national politics in the years that followed. There is still a chance that such movements could secure referendums on EU membership in a few countries at some point in the future.\n\nIn May 2016, global research firm Ipsos released a report showing that a majority of respondents in Italy and France believe their countries should hold a referendum on EU membership.\n\nItaly\n\nThe fragile Italian banking sector has driven a wedge between the EU and the Italian government, which provided bailout funds to save mom-and-pop bondholders from being \u201cbailed in,\u201d as EU rules stipulate. The government abandoned its 2019 budget when the EU threatened it with sanctions. It lowered its planned budget deficit from 2.5% of GDP to 2.04%.\n\nMatteo Salvini, the far-right head of Italy\u2019s Northern League and the country\u2019s deputy prime minister, called for a referendum on EU membership hours after the Brexit vote, saying, \u201cThis vote was a slap in the face for all those who say that Europe is their own business and Italians don\u2019t have to meddle with that.\u201d\n\nThe Northern League has an ally in the populist Five Star Movement, whose founder, former comedian Beppe Grillo, called for a referendum on Italy\u2019s membership in the euro\u2014though not the EU. The two parties formed a coalition government in 2018 and made Giuseppe Conte prime minister. Conte ruled out the possibility of \u201cItalexit\u201d in 2018 during the budget standoff.\n\nFrance\n\nMarine Le Pen, the leader of France\u2019s Euroskeptic National Front, hailed the Brexit vote as a win for nationalism and sovereignty across Europe: \u201cLike a lot of French people, I\u2019m very happy that the U.K. people held on and made the right choice.
