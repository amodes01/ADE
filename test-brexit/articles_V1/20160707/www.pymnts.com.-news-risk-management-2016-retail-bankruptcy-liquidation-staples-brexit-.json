    "text": "Remember Martin Shkreli? Probably not. Remember the Pharma Bro? Ah, of course.\n\nWhile Shkreli still sits free on bail awaiting what looks to be a short trial for his alleged price-gouging practices while helming Turing Pharmaceuticals, another of Shkreli\u2019s pharma companies \u2014 KaloBios \u2014 announced on Friday (July 1) that it had officially emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings originally begun as a result of the Pharma Bro\u2019s arrest. KaloBios wasn\u2019t afraid to stick it to Shkreli either, claiming that the company has \u201crisen from the ashes \u2026 to move forward as a successful, positive leader in our industry.\u201d\n\nOh, and just to twist the knife, new shares diluted Shkreli\u2019s former 47 percent stake in the company to 14 percent.\n\nIt just goes to prove that, even in the near-constant gloom of the Chapter 11 Watch, the good guys can still pull out a win every now and then.\n\nBankruptcies\n\nFor every Pharma Bro that gets his comeuppance, though, there are dozens of well-meaning retailers that slide into bankruptcy despite their best efforts. That\u2019s what Alabama-based Simply Fashion Stores decided last year when it filed Chapter 11 documents in April, and it might be a sign of the times that, though the merchant operated 250 stores in several states, it managed to breeze through bankruptcy proceedings and secure a judge\u2019s approval for liquidation in the space of just about 14 months.\n\n\u201cLiquidation sales and turning off the lights at each of the stores took at most two-and-a-half months,\u201d Christopher Jarvinen, debtor counsel for Simply Fashion, told Daily Business Review. \u201cThat is phenomenal for a store chain of this size.\u201d\n\nAs per terms of the hastily approved liquidation plan, Simply Fashion will be on the hook for all secured claims and between 1 and 2 percent of the $15 million in unsecured claims on its assets. It might not be the plan creditors hoped for, but the shaky brick-and-mortar retail market seems to suggest that they should gladly take a dollar today instead of two tomorrow.\n\nStore Closures\n\nRon Burgundy wasn\u2019t talking about the Brexit when he lamented, \u201cBoy, that escalated quickly. I mean that really got out of hand.\u201d But now that prime ministers, opposition leaders and dozens of other public figures are ducking for cover from public scrutiny, it appears as if Brexit fallout is just ramping up in the retail sector.\n\nAccording to The Telegraph, Staples\u2018 still-uncertain future following its failed merger with Office Depot is causing some executives to wonder whether the equally volatile situation in the post-EU U.K. is worth the retailer\u2019s time. Staples is said to be looking at cutting around $300 million from its annual costs, and the 200 stores it runs on the British Isles appear to be first in line for the chopping block. Staples has already retained KPMG for consultations on whether its U.K. business should be sold, restructured or allowed to slip into bankruptcy \u2014 all under the corporate-speak of \u201cexploring strategic alternatives for [Staples\u2019] European operations.\u201d\n\nWhatever the result, it doesn\u2019t appear as if Staples\u2019 U.K. brick-and-mortar footprint is long for the retail world.\n\nLayoffs\n\nSometimes, political shifts can bring down a retailer. Other times, it\u2019s merchants own actions that sink their once-seaworthy ships. However, in the case of Tekserve, Manhattan\u2019s three-decades-old center for consumer electronics repairs that predates any Apple Genius Bar, time simply caught up with it.\n\nIn an interview with The New York Times, Tekserve CEO Jerry Gepner disclosed that the company will be shuttering its West 23rd Street store after 29 years in business. As a result, 70 employees will be put out on the street. However, Gepner acknowledged that Tekserve\u2019s business model just doesn\u2019t apply in a world where big-box tech retailers, like Apple and Best Buy, offer similar services over a much wider physical network and often as add-ons for buying electronics from them in the first place.\n\n\u201cThis is a cultural shift,\u201d Gepner told NYT. \u201cIt\u2019s not a failure of the business. It\u2019s like this giant wave finally crashed down upon us.\u201d\n\nGepner joined Tekserve in 2014 with the mission of exploring the options of a turnaround, but he acknowledged to the owners of the business that it was unlikely even back then. Between a sea change in consumer behaviors around electronics since the 1980s and New York\u2019s well-documented problem with rent increases as high as its Midtown skyline, Gepner and Tekserve had to come to the unfortunate realization that \u201cthere comes a point where [the business] doesn\u2019t make sense anymore, as much as we love it.\u201d",
