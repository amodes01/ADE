    "text": "Last fall, with little fanfare, the Texas Teachers Retirement System, or TRS, set up an office in London. That means that Britain\u2019s recent vote to leave the European Union could be felt a little closer to home for the state\u2019s 1.4 million public education employees and retirees.\n\nThe hope was to be where the action is, so that the $130 billion pension fund could be \u201cin the room\u201d for the best opportunities in Europe\u2019s private equity and other markets. Harold Evensky is chairman of wealth management firm Evensky and Katz in Lubbock.\n\n\u201cAs the economy becomes much more global and the competition gets much stiffer, it\u2019s credible to me that having a small presence there makes sense,\u201d he said.\n\nDisclaimer: Evensky's also a professor at Texas Tech University. He's a participant in TRS, as is the staff at KUT.\n\nThe pension fund wanted to be near the action, and it got it. It opened just in time for one of the biggest economic decisions - perhaps the biggest upheaval - to hit the continent in decades, Britain\u2019s vote to leave the EU.\n\n\u201cLondon has been, really the heart of UK and European financial markets. I don\u2019t know if in a couple of years that\u2019s going to be the case, but certainly it is right now,\u201d Evensky said.\n\nLondon is the financial center of the European Union for several reasons, among them free movement of employees. That served two purposes: It allowed London-based firms to choose from the best candidates across the continent and gave them unfettered access to countries to do deals; it also made it a place for pensions, sovereign wealth funds and international companies to locate for investments.\n\nWhat\u2019s next? No one really has answers, but the sense is that there is time to figure that out.\n\n\u201cIt will be a while, years, if there is any significant transition in terms of where is the primary home for European financial markets,\u201d Evensky said.\n\nFor the dozens of Texas companies that have opened UK offices, it could mean opening more shops within the EU, as Patrick Jankowski, an economist at the Greater Houston Partnership, told Houston Public Media last week.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s as simple as if you have an office in London and you\u2019re using your office in London to serve the Continent, now you probably need an office in London and an office in Bonn, or an office in Paris or Berlin or somewhere,\u201d Jankowski said.\n\nThe same could be said for TRS.\n\nAs for market concerns after the British referendum, Evensky said it\u2019s \u201cjust simply going to be a small blip in a long-term, bumpy-but-rising international equity market.\u201d",
