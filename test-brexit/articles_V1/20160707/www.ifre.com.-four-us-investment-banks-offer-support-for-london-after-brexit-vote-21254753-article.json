    "text": "(Reuters) - Four US investment banks promised British finance minister George Osborne on Thursday that they would try to help London keep its top spot as a financial centre, but gave no commitment on jobs following Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union.\n\nOne banker at the meeting with Osborne told Reuters the banks wanted to see concrete moves to ensure firms based in London would retain access to EU markets, however, because \u201cno one in their right mind\u201d would currently invest in Britain.\u201d\n\nSince the June 23 referendum there have been fears of an exodus from the City of London if access to the EU\u2019s single market becomes significantly harder. Banks like JP Morgan have said they could move thousands of jobs.\n\nOn Thursday JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley, as well as Britain\u2019s Asia-focused Standard Chartered said they would try to support London\u2019s financial sector.\n\n\u201cToday we met and agreed that we would work together \u2026 with a common aim to help London retain its position as the leading international financial centre,\u201d the banks said in a joint statement with Osborne.\n\nThe statement said no other city in Europe had capital markets as deep as those of London, but the banks made no commitment about keeping jobs in Britain.\n\nBanks at the meeting sought immediate reassurance over the fate of EU staff currently working in London, and urged a pragmatic approach to quickly ensure Britain retained access to the EU single market.\n\nBut any permanent trade deal is likely to be years away, given the normal length such agreements take and the political vacuum as Britain\u2019s ruling Conservatives picks a new leader.\n\nThe French government pledged on Wednesday to make its tax regime for expatriates the most favourable in Europe in a land grab for London banking business.\n\nGoldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have denied speculation they were poised to shift London-based staff and operations to Frankfurt.\n\nJamie Dimon, the head of JP Morgan Chase, said before the referendum that the bank could have to move up to 4,000 staff from the UK in the event of a Brexit vote.\n\nOsborne, who was senior figure in the failed campaign to keep Britain in the EU, has spent years trying to expand London\u2019s role as a global hub for trade in China\u2019s renminbi and India\u2019s rupee, as well as Islamic finance.\n\nOn Wednesday the Lord Mayor of the City of London, the district in the capital that is home to many large banks, said the government needed to ensure EU exit talks preserved financial services firms\u2019 \u201cpassporting\u201d rights that allow them to use London as a base for EU-wide activities.\n\nOsborne has said Britain needs to ensure a heavy emphasis on trade ties, including financial services, in EU exit talks.\n\nOn Tuesday, he met British domestic banks, whose share prices have tumbled since the Brexit vote, and encouraged them to make more funds available for UK lending after the Bank of England eased capital rules.\n\nReporting by David Milliken and Lawrence White; Additional reporting by Andrew MacAskill",
