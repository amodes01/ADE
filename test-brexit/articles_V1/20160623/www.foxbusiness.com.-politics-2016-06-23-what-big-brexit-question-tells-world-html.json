    "text": "As the United Kingdom votes on whether to cut ties with the European Union, former Senior Advisor to Prime Minister David Cameron, Steve Hilton, says the most important question facing U.K. voters is who\u2019s really in control?\n\n\u201cIn Europe, the people who initiate the legislation impose regulation on all the countries, including on immigration, aren\u2019t elected by anybody \u2013 and that\u2019s why this really is a question of democracy \u2013 about who actually controls and runs a country \u2013 the people of that country or some amorphous system of bureaucracy and regulation that no one really can control,\u201d he told the FOX Business Network\u2019s Maria Bartiromo.\n\nNow living in America as a tech firm head, Hilton said the \u201cexperience of working in government\u201d and the amount of regulation and legislation coming from the EU moved the needle to vote leave.\n\n\u201cAt one point it was over half of the actions that the British government were taking, were actually driven by the EU \u2013 and they were things that the British government didn\u2019t actually agree with but we had to concede in order to win other arguments in Brussels. So it really made the job of governing a country, the elected government, kind of impossible and I thought that was fundamentally un-democratic,\u201d he said.\n\nEven though he remains at odds with Prime Minister David Cameron, Hilton says they have remained good friends. He also explained how the vote will send signals to the rest of the world.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not easy for me to be on the other side from him but I think in the end, this is a really big question that is bigger than any one general election. It\u2019s going to have an impact here for generations and I think an impact around the wider world because it will send a signal that this centralization of power that you can see going on everywhere \u2013 people have had enough of it.\u201d",
