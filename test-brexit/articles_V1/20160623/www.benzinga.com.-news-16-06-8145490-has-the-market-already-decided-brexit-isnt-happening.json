    "text": "Voters in Britain are deciding the fate of the country's membership within the European Union in a vote dubbed \"Brexit\" Thursday.\n\nBillionaire investor George Soros cautioned against a vote to leave the European Union, a view that was also shared by BlackRock's CEO Larry Fink and even the British-born comedian John Oliver.\n\nRelated Link: Everything You Need To Know About The Brexit\n\nDespite the large degree of uncertainty over the vote, not to mention complete uncertainty over what will happen to Britain's economic future, U.S. stocks were surging on Thursday \u2014 a complete reversal from the popular notion that fear and uncertainty are bad for the markets.\n\nThe UK's main index, the FTSE 100, gained 1.23 percent during its trading session on Thursday.\n\nHas The Stay Side Already Won?\n\nIt appears market participants are under the assumption that the \"stay\" vote has already won, and any and all the uncertainties under a \"leave\" outcome no longer need to be discussed.\n\nPolls out of Britain were confirming investor sentiment and calling for a \"stay\" victory. If this is the case, the new question investors and traders need to ask is if there will be large amounts of \"sell the news\" when the voting is finalized and tallied.\n\nRelated Link: Brexit Has Been A Bane For These ETFs\n\nThere is no doubt that the Brexit vote has been one of the most talked about events that could shape the markets over the past few months.\n\nThe coming days will show if the Brexit fades into a distant memory and investor attention is yet again glued to the Federal Reserve.\n\nOr, maybe the \"leave\" side will emerge victorious and investors and traders will need to re-examine their investment outlook \u2014 and quickly, as the markets have had a habit of turning nasty throughout 2016.\n\nA Few ETFs",
