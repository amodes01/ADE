His team manages about $3 billion. Parent Manulife Asset Management oversees about US$325 billion. \u201cWe will be a buyer in a leave scenario, looking at stocks we like that overreact.

The Canadian benchmark has jumped 8.7 per cent this year, the most among developed markets tracked by Bloomberg amid rallies in commodities producers. Belisle has an elevated 6 per cent cash position in his portfolio, and suggests investors \u201cplay defense\u201d in preparation for the voting results. Polls close in the referendum at 10 p.m. London time. Polling before Wednesday suggested the vote is finely balanced between the two camps, while financial markets and betting odds indicate \u201cRemain\u201d is on course to win. Recommended from Editorial Terence Corcoran: Trump, Clinton and Brexit \u2014 the three horses of democracy\u2019s Apocalypse Joe Chidley: These are the lessons of Brexit, regardless of what happens with the vote Could Plunge In the event of a Brexit, developed world markets could plunge as much as 8 per cent over the following two trading days, Belisle said. The Canadian market meanwhile could drop 6 per cent to 12 per cent. If there is a correction in crude prices, Belisle will be on the hunt for Canadian energy stocks.\n\nTop Stories Get the latest headlines, breaking news and columns.

WSP Global Inc., an engineering services company with offices in 40 countries, is another stock to consider, he said. If the U.K. votes to stick with the EU, Belisle will consider Canadian and U.S. banks amid \u201cmore widespread buying\u201d as the overhang of Brexit concern fades. In such a scenario, global stocks could gain about 5 per cent over several days, with the S&P/TSX having as much as 8 per cent upside. With investors paying a premium for protection against calamity in the equity market, this presents an opportunity for options investors to take advantage by buying cheap calls if Brexit fails, according to Hans Albrecht, a fund manager at Horizons ETFs Management Canada Inc. A measure of the spread in prices between 1-month bullish and bearish options, or skew, in the iShares S&P/TSX 60 Index exchange-traded fund, the largest, most liquid ETF in Canada, jumped to the highest level since 2011 Wednesday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Even after the S&P/TSX rally this year, the too-close-to-call outcome of the vote and the low cost of contracts that pay in the event Canadian shares rise make now the time to boost bullish bets, Albrecht said.\n\nAdvertisement 4 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content \u201cRight now you either have nothing going on in the market or you have everyone overdoing it on the fear side,\u201d Albrecht said. Horizons manages about US$5.4 billion in ETF products. \u201cWith bullish sentiment levels at multi-year lows and in some cases multi-decade lows, buying inexpensively priced upside calls makes great sense. It\u2019s a great time to own upside calls. They\u2019re way cheaper than they usually are.\u201d The vote\u2019s impact on Canada\u2019s currency meanwhile is likely to be muted, said Shaun Osborne, chief foreign-exchange strategist at Bank of Nova Scotia. \u201cOur fundamental ties with the U.K. make up a small portion of the economic pie,\u201d Osborne said in a phone interview from Toronto. The U.K. is Canada\u2019s fifth-largest trading partner, with about US$21.2 billion in total trade last year, compared with more than US$540 billion for the U.S. Osborne estimates the Canadian dollar, or loonie, may strengthen to as high as $1.2650 in the event of a \u201cRemain\u201d vote, or fall to $1.34 against the U.S. dollar in an exit. The loonie fell 0.7 per cent to $1.275 at 11:26 a.m. in Toronto trading. Either way, the impact on North American equity markets will be short-lived, Manulife\u2019s Belisle said. Once the referendum excitement dies down, investors will turn their attention back to more pressing issues including the upcoming U.S. presidential election and the pace of potential interest-rate increases at the Federal Reserve, he said. \u201cThings will settle down and then we will go back to our more typical concerns,\u201d Belisle said.
