    "text": "DODD AND FRANK FIGHT TO DEFEND DODD-FRANK: The primary authors of the Dodd-Frank financial reform law have joined a court fight over one of its central powers.\n\nA group of 20 current and former lawmakers, all Democrats, filed an amicus brief Thursday arguing a judge missed the mark ruling against regulators in a critical test of the law\u2019s powers.\n\n{mosads}Among those signing on to the effort are former Sen. Chris Dodd (D-Conn.) and former Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.).\n\nIn the brief, the lawmakers argued that if a district judge\u2019s ruling stands, it would \u201cfundamentally undermine\u201d Congress\u2019s vision for Dodd-Frank as drafted. Both have since retired from office.\n\n\u201cBy substituting its own judgment for that of [regulators], the district court undermined not only the statutory scheme that Congress put in place in Dodd-Frank, but also the nation\u2019s ability to prevent another financial crisis,\u201d they wrote. The Hill\u2019s Peter Schroeder explains: http://bit.ly/28RjxxE.\n\nRYAN REBUKES OBAMA ON BREXIT: House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) on Thursday called out President Obama for weighing in on the United Kingdom\u2019s vote to stay in or leave the European Union.\n\nRyan joined several Republican lawmakers by refusing to state a preference as British voters head to polls, while Obama has urged the nation to stay in the EU.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to do exactly what the president did not do and not weigh in on this, and send the signal to our great friends and allies in Britain that we stand with them regardless of what decision they make,\u201d Ryan told reporters. I\u2019ll tell you why here: http://bit.ly/28QJEmB.\n\nAnd check out TheHill.com for the result.\n\nCLINTON CAMPAIGN BOASTS BOOST FROM BUSINESS LEADERS: Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign on Thursday released a list of corporate leaders from both parties that have endorsed her, pushing back on Donald Trump\u2019s claims of support in the business world. We\u2019ve got the full list\u2013including Sheryl Sandberg and Magic Johnson\u2013right here: http://bit.ly/28TzSVy.\n\nHAPPY THURSDAY and welcome to Overnight Finance, where we\u2019re saluting our colleagues who stayed up as long as the Democrats did. I\u2019m Sylvan Lane, and here\u2019s your nightly guide to everything affecting your bills, bank account and bottom line.\n\nTonight\u2019s highlights include trouble for the Puerto Rico debt bill, Obama\u2019s warning for Wall Street and a line in the sand on ObamaCare.\n\nSee something I missed?

And if you like your newsletter, you can subscribe to it here: http://bit.ly/1NxxW2N.\n\nPUERTO RICAN OFFICIALS PLEAD WITH SENATE TO PASS DEBT RELIEF: Top Treasury Department and Puerto Rican officials are begging the Senate to move quickly on a bill to help the commonwealth handle more than $70 billion in unpayable debt.\n\nFunding for public services in Puerto Rico is drying up under the commonwealth\u2019s shrinking economy and lack of access to credit markets, so leaders are pushing the Senate to clear a House-passed bill before a crucial debt payment that is due July 1.\n\n\u201cWe need the bill by July 1,\u201d Puerto Rico Gov. Alejandro Garc\u00eda Padilla (D) said during a Thursday panel hosted by the progressive Center for American Progress Action Fund. \u201cWe need the bill yesterday.\u201d I\u2019ll tell you here about their concerns: http://bit.ly/28TzEhe.\n\nSENATE DEM OPENS DOOR TO BLOCKING BILL: Senate Democrats are pushing to amend a House-passed debt relief bill for Puerto Rico, and one says he won\u2019t rule out blocking the bill if they don\u2019t get the chance.\n\n\u201cI will consider all of my options if I don\u2019t get a chance to amend it,\u201d Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), a long-time critic of the House bill, said Thursday.\n\nMenendez could put a \u201chold\u201d on the bill, blocking it from consideration unless at least 60 senators vote to advance it.\n\nMajority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is expected to schedule a vote right before the Senate breaks for its July 4 recess. That would force Democrats to back the bill without a chance to amend it.\n\nA senior Senate Republican leadership aide said this month that any amendments would need unanimous approval, and a senior Democratic leadership aide said most Democrats would support the bill without a chance to amend it: http://bit.ly/290mNXR.\n\nAREA DAD TALKS ABOUT DAUGHTERS, FINANCIAL REGULATION: President Obama knows one place his daughters won\u2019t end up working: Wall Street.\n\nIn a new interview, Obama laughed off the idea that anyone in his family would end up working in the financial sector. In fact, he suggested that too many talented Americans may be wooed by power and paychecks on Wall Street and could use their abilities elsewhere.\n\n\u201cIf you start getting to the point where 40 percent of the economy is taken up by the financial sector and that our best and brightest are going into financial work as opposed to engineering or computer science, then we could actually lose our competitive edge over time,\u201d he told Bloomberg Businessweek.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty certain that my daughters will not end up working on Wall Street,\u201d he said when asked about their future.\n\nObama went on to argue that the financial sector still needs to take a broader perspective on its role in the country and the lingering anger in the public toward Wall Street. Peter Schroeder has more: http://bit.ly/28QafUL.\n\nREID: HOUSE-PASSED ZIKA DEAL A DISGRACE: Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) ripped a GOP deal to provide $1.1 billion to fight the Zika virus hours after it passed the House.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a disgrace. It\u2019s a mockery of how Congress should treat an emergency,\u201d he said from the Senate floor. \u201cThis is something that I\u2019m sorry to say is part of the McConnell-Trump tactics we\u2019ve found lately.\u201d\n\nReid\u2019s comments come after House Republicans approved the plan in an early morning vote over the protest of Democrats.\n\nThe Zika deal \u2014 which is attached to a larger military and veterans spending bill \u2014 would be partially paid for by using money from other health department proprieties, including the Ebola virus fund.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) tried to temper Democratic opposition, saying the House-passed deal \u201crepresents our only chance to put Zika control money to work right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe House did its part. Now the Senate needs to do its part,\u201d he added. The Hill\u2019s Jordain Carney takes us there: http://bit.ly/28TzZ3s.\n\nFED WEIGHS CHANGES AFTER HEIST: The Federal Reserve is considering \u201cenhanced monitoring\u201d for certain kinds of transactions, after hackers stole $81 million from the Bangladesh central bank\u2019s account at the New York branch, Fed chairman Janet Yellen told lawmakers Wednesday.\n\n\u201cWe expect the institutions we supervise to make sure that they comply with procedures to control access to critical payment services and to review and insure that they\u2019re meeting security requirements,\u201d Yellen said in response to questions from Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.), who said she was \u201cvery concerned\u201d about the breach.\n\n\u201cI think this is a threat to the U.S. banking system,\u201d Maloney said.\n\nThe New York Fed\u2019s systems weren\u2019t compromised, Yellen emphasized during a House Financial Services hearing on monetary policy.\n\nIn February, unknown hackers stole $81 million from the Bangladesh Bank account at the New York Fed in what is considered the largest cyberheist in history.\n\nTo pull off the heist, the hackers exploited a flaw in SWIFT, a messaging network used by banks across the globe to exchange information about financial transfers. The Hill\u2019s Katie Bo Williams breaks it down: http://bit.ly/290n7pE.\n\nGOP DRAWS BATTLE LINE WITH OBAMACARE: Speaker Paul Ryan on Wednesday formally unveiled the House GOP alternative plan for the Affordable Care Act, billing it as the culmination of years of party pledges and effort.\n\n\u201cFor six years now, we\u2019ve promised to repeal and replace ObamaCare and make healthcare actually affordable,\u201d the Wisconsin Republican said at an event at the American Enterprise Institute. \u201cWell, here it is: a real plan \u2014 in black and white \u2014 right here.\u201d\n\nThe plan envisions a simpler system than ObamaCare with limited financial assistance, lighter regulation and less federal spending on healthcare. It allows for less generous, basic health plans, as opposed to ObamaCare plans, which must cover an array of required elements.\n\nDemocrats immediately attacked the plan, saying it is just a broad outline, and one that, if ever implemented, would roll back the coverage gains of ObamaCare. The Hill\u2019s Peter Sullivan explains: http://bit.ly/28QazTu.\n\nCONFEDERATE FLAG BAN DROPPED FROM SPENDING BILL: A measure to restrict the display of the Confederate battle flag in national cemeteries approved by the House last month has been pulled from the chamber\u2019s final compromise spending bill.\n\nThe House passed a spending package along party lines early Thursday morning that includes appropriations for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), as well as emergency funding for combating the Zika virus.\n\nRep. Jared Huffman\u2019s (D-Calif.) amendment, adopted as part of the House\u2019s version of the 2017 VA spending bill, would have prohibited the large-scale display of the Confederate battle flag in cemeteries run by the VA, such as flying the banner over mass graves.\n\nIt would still have allowed families to still place small flags on individual graves on two days of the year: Memorial Day and Confederate Memorial Day. Here\u2019s more from The Hill\u2019s Cristina Marcos: http://bit.ly/28VG7qe.\n\nTAX BREAK TALK: House Ways and Means Committee ranking member Sandy Levin (D-Mich.) on Thursday expressed optimism that Congress will eliminate the carried interest tax break in the future.\n\n\u201cIf we go to the public \u2026 my guess is that the overwhelming number of people would say, overwhelmingly, that carried interest is a loophole that needs to go,\u201d Levin said at a press conference.\n\nCarried interest refers to the share of profits that investment fund managers take in exchange for running the funds. Carried interest is currently taxed as capital gains rather than like normal income.\n\nLevin and Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) last year introduced legislation that would tax carried interest as income. The lawmakers spoke about the need to end the tax break along with members of the Patriotic Millionaires, a group of wealthy individuals who want to reduce income inequality. The Hill\u2019s Naomi Jagoda tells us more: http://bit.ly/28VG7qx.\n\nFURMAN SAYS PACIFIC TRADE DEAL WILL PASS THIS YEAR: A top Obama administration official said Thursday that Congress will pass an expansive Pacific Rim trade agreement before President Obama leaves office.\n\nJason Furman, chairman of the White House\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, said he expects lawmakers on Capitol Hill to pass the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) during the lame-duck session after the November election.\n\n\u201cI think the support is there,\u201d Furman said during a discussion with Bloomberg Politics.\n\nFurman said passing the TPP is \u201cperfectly reasonable\u201d \u2014 even with a new administration moving into the White House in January \u2014 because the agreement will have been available for public scrutiny for a year by that time, much longer than most legislation gets vetted. The Hill\u2019s Vicki Needham tells us why: http://bit.ly/28ON3Du.\n\nPOLL: TRADE POPULAR IN SWING STATES AND WITH DEMS: Trade is more popular with voters in swing states than the presumptive Democratic and Republican presidential nominees might think, especially among Democrats, according to a new poll.\n\nVoters in four battleground states \u2014 Colorado, Florida, Nevada and Ohio \u2014 expressed positive views about the U.S. expanding trade, even while Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump call for major changes to the nation\u2019s global commercial outreach.\n\nA new Progressive Policy Institute (PPI) poll on Wednesday shows that by a 55 to 32 percent margin swing-state voters say that new high-standard trade deals can help the U.S. economy and support good-paying jobs.\n\nDemocrats are particularly supportive, 66 to 25 percent.\n\nAll four states will play an outsized role in who wins the presidency in November: http://bit.ly/28TZS15.\n\nWrite us with tips, suggestions and news: slane@thehill.com, vneedham@thehill.com; pschroeder@thehill.com, and njagoda@thehill.com.
