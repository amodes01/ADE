Our analysis of their policy positions, from fracking to air pollution, suggests that a government led by them would be swift to water down the protections agreed by their elected predecessors. That\u2019s part of why they want us out\u2026Climate is the one area where the UK has \u2013 in some ways \u2013 gone further than it\u2019s been forced to go by agreements made collectively at a EU level, at least in terms of the targets which it has set. Yet those targets are already on course to be missed and what the UK\u2019s targets do not have is any clarity about possible punishment for failing to meet them. What will be enforced is the commitments to reduce emissions which we\u2019ve made with our EU partners. Unless we leave.\u201d",
