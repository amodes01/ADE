That\u2019s how Ireland is viewing today\u2019s referendum on the British membership in the European Union, a divisive debate where polls have shown citizens vacillating between \u201cLeave\u201d and \u201cRemain\u201d in the days leading up to the decisive vote.\n\nFrom an economic perspective, Ireland would very much like the United Kingdom to remain in the bloc, citing the uncertainty that would follow a \u201cBrexit,\u201d as the abandonment of the status quo has been called.\n\n\u201cThey are our largest trading partner, and we\u2019re unequivocal in our view that it would be better for everybody, including the Irish, if the United Kingdom stays within the EU,\u201d said Emmanuel Dowdall, head of IDA Ireland for North America, who fears a two-year period of uncertainty that would follow if Britain has to negotiate the terms of its EU breakup. In terms of trade deals, the U.K. would have to start from scratch, and what\u2019s hammered out with the EU as a whole would affect all its individual European trading relationships.\n\nBrexit could have a potential downward impact on the British pound, hurt bilateral trade with Ireland and engender ambiguous implications for the credibility of the EU, he said.\n\n\u201cI think it validates the strength and the aspirations of the European Union in a way that would be far better if they stayed,\u201d he said.\n\nThat said, the EU\u2019s only other English-speaking country (and already the only one in the euro area) realizes that many multinational corporate headquarters would be up for grabs, given that that many want one base for the entire 28-member bloc.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re already having a very good level of success in terms of (foreign direct investment), but I do think that in the short term you\u2019ll see some increased activity, particularly in the financial services environment,\u201d Mr. Dowdall said in an interview in late May in Atlanta, where he previously worked and maintains a home. \u201cFrom that perspective, Ireland is already hearing from companies that are doing a range of scenario planning.\u201d\n\nIreland knows a thing or two about how investors value predictability when making major decisions.\n\nThe country underwent a major financial crisis caused by a property bust in 2009 but had the discipline to implement austerity measures that have reined in debt without touching the sacrosanct corporate tax rate of 12.5 percent. That has been a major arrow in Ireland\u2019s recruitment quiver.\n\n\u201cIreland was able to restructure and re-profile itself to international investors,\u201d Mr. Dowdall said.\n\nIn 2015, FDI surged to record levels, and more importantly for a country that has embarked on a job creation plan, the levels of employment by foreign investors also swelled. The economy overall grew by more than 7 percent last year.\n\nAbout 180,000 jobs in Ireland, a country of 4 million people, are directly supported by foreign investment, 137,000 of them by companies from the United States. Multiplied out by broader economic impacts of those infusions, Invest Ireland calculates that nearly 20 percent of the total private-sector labor force can be traced back to investment from overseas.",
