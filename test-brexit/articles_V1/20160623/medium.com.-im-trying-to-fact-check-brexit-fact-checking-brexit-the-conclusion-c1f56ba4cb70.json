    "text": "I\u2019ve now spent the last three weeks fact-checking every detail on Brexit that I possibly could.\n\nI\u2019ve read 90-page government reports on my way to a wedding. I\u2019ve hacked through academic analyses of the EU when I really should have been promoting my Virtual Reality game. I\u2019ve treated myself to a fun Google search for the accounts of pro-Remain activists to check that they\u2019re not biased. And so on.\n\n(Here are all the posts I wrote as a result. )\n\nIt has been surprisingly interesting, in some ways. And frustrating in others.\n\nBut that\u2019s not what you care about.\n\nYou care about who\u2019s telling the truth, who isn\u2019t, and who you should vote for.\n\nSo who\u2019s more reliable?\n\nI came into this leaning cautiously to Remain. However, I really hoped to find that my initial impressions of Leave were wildly wrong, and I was hoping they had very strong arguments.\n\nWhy? Because the country might vote for Leave. And if that happens I\u2019d much rather be saying \u201cwell, at the end of the day both sides have a good point\u201d than \u201coh god, oh god, we\u2019re in real trouble now\u201d.\n\nUnfortunately, \u201cwell, at the end of the day both sides have a good point\u201d is not what I found.\n\nLeave\u2019s Reliability\n\nAt every single turn, I found that the Leave campaign\u2019s arguments were founded on lies. Sorry, it\u2019s as simple as that. I wish it wasn\u2019t.\n\nThey lie about how much money we spend on the EU. I\u2019d love to say \u201cthey\u2019re misinformed\u201d, or \u201cthey exaggerate\u201d, but they don\u2019t. They lie. Outright.\n\nThey lie about the business case for Leave. I still have found absolutely no support whatsoever for the figures that are confidently quoted here.\n\nThey lie about the state of democracy in the EU. The more I investigate the EU, the more I find out it\u2019s fairer and better set up than the UK\u2019s government. Just today I discovered that the European Commission\u2019s role in legislation is actually far more balanced than I thought.\n\nAnd the Leave campaign lie a lot more. I haven\u2019t had time to post all the mini-fact-checks I\u2019ve found. As just one example, the Vote Leave website claims\n\nBecause of free movement laws, the UK cannot test every EU doctor operating in the UK for whether they can speak English\n\nAs proof, they link to an article in the Guardian about a horrible accident thanks to a doctor not understanding English. In that article, it explicitly states:\n\nThe GMC, which registers doctors and licenses them to work, has been able to check EU medics\u2019 English since last summer\u2026\n\nIn other words, Leave\u2019s statement is absolutely untrue, and that\u2019s proved by an article they themselves use as \u201cproof\u201d of their untrue statement.\n\nI haven\u2019t had time to fact-check every single Leave claim, and some, like the claim that leaving \u201cwill make Britain Great again\u201d, aren\u2019t possible to fact-check.\n\nBut every single Leave claim I\u2019ve checked has turned out not to be exaggeration, not to be well-meaning misunderstanding, but to be obviously false.\n\nRemain\u2019s Reliability\n\nRemain\u2019s campaign has been criticised for being dull, being negative, and being led by people who are thoroughly disliked.\n\nAll of those claims are entirely reasonable. Personally I intensely dislike both Cameron and Osborne. I\u2019m about as much of a fan of the current UK government as I am of bowel cancer.\n\nBut every claim of theirs I\u2019ve checked \u2014 even the ones that had pro-Remain friends shouting about how over the top and ridiculous they were has turned out to be more or less sound.\n\nTheir arguments are evidence-based.\n\nTheir evidence is solid.\n\nTheir backup studies are detailed and provide sources and reasoning.\n\nI could rarely pick any holes in their logic.\n\nTheir studies tally with independent studies of the same things, and sometimes they\u2019re using independent studies rather than anything they control.\n\nThe worst I was able to prove was that one point in a 90-page review seemed to lack backup evidence. And that\u2019s the same review whose conclusion almost all credible external sources agreed with.\n\nI really wasn\u2019t expecting that. I was expecting both sides \u2014 as many people have claimed \u2014 to be equally full of it.\n\nBut Remain seems to have played it pretty straight, and presented solid, well-founded claims. Having dug deep into their campaign, I\u2019ve actually emerged more impressed than when I started.\n\nSo Which Way Should You Vote?\n\nBased purely on which side\u2019s arguments are actually true, and which side\u2019s aren\u2019t, you should vote Remain.\n\nRemain claim that Brexit would be bad for the country, and they\u2019ve presented evidence to support that claim. I\u2019ve checked quite a lot of that evidence, and it all seems to be reliable.\n\nRemain appear to be telling the truth, Leave don\u2019t.",
