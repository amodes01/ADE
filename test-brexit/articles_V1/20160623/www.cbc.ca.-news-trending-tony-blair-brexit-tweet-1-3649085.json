    "text": "Former British prime minister Tony Blair is the latest politician to become prey to Twitter users' penchant for Photoshop memes.\n\nBlair weighed in on today's Brexit vote, tweeting a photo of himself holding a white card announcing his stance. In other words, he gave the internet a blank slate and said, \"Go nuts.\"\n\nI believe voting to Remain will secure Britain\u2019s place as a proud, influential country with a strong economy. TB <a href=\"https://t.co/q6rIJI8JIx\">pic.twitter.com/q6rIJI8JIx</a> \u2014@tonyblairoffice\n\nBlair remains a controversial figure after his time in office and Brits took this opportunity to criticize his political legacy. Within minutes, Twitter users were replacing \"I Voted Remain\" with some pointed remarks.\n\nNo Tony, stop that <a href=\"https://t.co/Un6glHIHaJ\">pic.twitter.com/Un6glHIHaJ</a> \u2014@TechnicallyRon\n\nOthers went beyond British politics with their posts, targeting both Blair and Donald Trump.\n\nFar too proud of this <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jimwaterson\">@jimwaterson</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/6z9qyOydWw\">pic.twitter.com/6z9qyOydWw</a> \u2014@_CalumBrown\n\nSomeone also couldn't pass up the opportunity to make a reference to Beyonc\u00e9's latest album.\n\nAh the old white card problem. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/EUref?src=hash\">#EUref</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/A43SIH2CZD\">pic.twitter.com/A43SIH2CZD</a> \u2014@LouisAlexDore\n\nOf course no internet meme is complete without John Cena.\n\nGood to see Tony Blair doing his bit. <a href=\"https://t.co/83O4gu7zCB\">pic.twitter.com/83O4gu7zCB</a> \u2014@Mike_Vaughan\n\nBlair isn't the only U.K. politician to make a Twitter faux pas. Two years ago, British Prime Minister David Cameron's Twitter photo of a phone call with U.S. President Barack Obama was mocked by celebrities, including Patrick Stewart.\n\nThe Brexit referendum ends today, but the internet is forever. Even when it's this weird.",
