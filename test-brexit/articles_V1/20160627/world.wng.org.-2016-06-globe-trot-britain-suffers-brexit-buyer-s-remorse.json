    "text": "BREXIT: All the experts seem to suggest the U.K. faces an economic downturn in the wake of last week\u2019s decision via referendum to leave the European Union. That\u2019s one reason real is sinking in this week.\n\nConservative opinion in the U.S. remains divided.\n\nMichael Barone suggests unaccountable EU bureaucrats fed the Brexit vote (and similar high voter turnout in November could fuel a Trump victory);\n\nJohn Bolton says the United States has a profound interest in Brexit success;\n\nDanielle Pletka warned Brexit won\u2019t improve security as long as the West pursues an incoherent strategy in Syria; and\n\nCharles Krauthammer : \u201cI think those who revel in the recovery of the sovereignty of Great Britain could find that it doesn\u2019t exist in 10 years.\u201d\n\nGarry Kasparov, increasingly one of my go-to foreign policy commentators, on Brexit as one more triumph of the demagogues:\n\n\u201cAll of this complacency and cowardice has shown how little our leaders care about the big picture, the long-term, and the future of Europe and the world. They have ignored that they are under real attack from political and religious extremists in their own countries, from radicals abroad, and from a wealthy dictator in Russia. This has left a vacuum to be filled by the demagogues, the hateful, the ignorant, the dream-sellers, and the jihadists. They have plans and they have purpose\u2014and they are winning.\u201d\n\nANGOLA: Oh my, there\u2019s an explosion of yellow fever in Africa no one seems to be talking about.\n\nCUBA\u2019s state-owned tourism company will take over Old Havana in \u201cone of the most brazen and underhanded measures ever taken by this military-run corporation,\u201d according to the historian of the City of Havana.\n\nPERU: Respected economist Pedro Pablo Kuczynski\u2014or P.P.K., as he\u2019s called\u2014takes office in late July with a worldly pedigree rare in a region with a longstanding love for folksy populists and authoritarians.\n\nTERRORISM: Not a day in April passed without a terror attack, leaving 858 killed from Peru to the Philippines.\n\nUNITED STATES: An Oklahoma district court has rejected a suit filed by a Syrian convert to Christianity against a local church. He alleged the church endangered his life by publishing news of his baptism. The court upheld the church\u2019s view that the public dissemination is \u201crooted in religious belief.\u201d",
