    "text": "In 1934, at the dawn of the Stalinist Terror, the great Russian writer Isaac Babel offered a daring quip at the International Writers Conference in Moscow:\n\n\u201cEverything is given to us by the party and the government. Only one right is taken away: the right to write badly.\u201d\n\nA onetime Soviet loyalist who was eventually shot as an enemy of the state, Babel was likely trying to say something profound: that the freedom to make mistakes is itself an essential component of freedom.\n\nAs a rule, people resent being saved from themselves. And if you think depriving people of their right to make mistakes makes sense, you probably never had respect for their right to make decisions at all.\n\nThis is all relevant in the wake of the Brexit referendum, in which British citizens narrowly voted to exit the European Union.\n\nBecause the vote was viewed as having been driven by the same racist passions that are fueling the campaign of Donald Trump, a wide swath of commentators suggested that democracy erred, and the vote should perhaps be canceled, for the Britons\u2019 own good.\n\nSocial media was filled with such calls. \u201cIs it just me, or does #Brexit seem like a moment when the government should overrule a popular referendum?\u201d wrote one typical commenter.\n\nOn op-ed pages, there was a lot of the same. Harvard economics professor and chess grandmaster Kenneth Rogoff wrote a piece for the Boston Globe called \u201cBritain\u2019s democratic failure\u201d in which he argued:\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t democracy; it is Russian roulette for republics. A decision of enormous consequence\u2026 has been made without any appropriate checks and balances.\u201d\n\nRogoff then went on to do something that\u2019s become popular in pundit circles these days: He pointed to the lessons of antiquity. Going back thousands of years, he said, Very Smart People have warned us about the dangers of allowing the rabble to make decisions.\n\n\u201cSince ancient times,\u201d he wrote, \u201cphilosophers have tried to devise systems to try to balance the strengths of majority rule against the need to ensure that informed parties get a larger say in critical decisions.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s picks\n\nPresumably playing the role of one of the \u201cinformed parties\u201d in this exercise, Rogoff went on:\n\n\u201cBy some accounts\u2026 Athens had implemented the purest historical example of democracy,\u201d he wrote. \u201cUltimately, though, after some catastrophic war decisions, Athenians saw a need to give more power to independent bodies.\u201d\n\nThis is exactly the argument that British blogging supernova Andrew Sullivan unleashed a few months ago in his 8,000-word diatribe against Donald Trump, \u201cDemocracies end when they are too democratic.\u201d\n\nLike Rogoff, Sullivan argued that over-democratic societies drift into passionate excesses, and need that vanguard of Very Smart People to make sure they don\u2019t get themselves into trouble.\n\n\u201cElites matter in a democracy,\u201d Sullivan argued, because they are the \u201ccritical ingredient to save democracy from itself.\u201d",
