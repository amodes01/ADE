    "text": "Much of the commentary in the media since the Brexit vote has focused on the parallels between Britain and the United States, particularly the similarities between the revolt against the elites in Britain and the Trump phenomenon in the United States. Both are presented as misguided and vaguely distasteful.\n\nThe media has seen Trump as successful because he has attacked and opposed the establishment in Washington, including those in his own party. If this is an accurate portrayal, the Republican elites should be as distressed by Brexit as the US Democrats, the British Conservatives, and the members of the international bureaucracies such as the IMF and the EU who have been so prominent in the media of late, denouncing Brexit.\n\nBut the absence of prominent Republicans from this crowd is notable and significant. Indeed, both Speaker Ryan and Senator Majority Leader McConnell praised Brexit over the weekend. This says a lot about the central ideas that dominate and motivate the GOP and how Republicans and conservatives differ from Democrats in their view of individuals and the role of government.\n\nTo most Republicans, the Brexit vote is an expression of a legitimate desire for self-governance and self-determination. Over the years, many Republicans have come to see the EU as an unaccountable bureaucracy, unconcerned about the interests of the people they govern and largely focused on preservation of their own power. How Europeans in general endured this illegitimate rule was a puzzle, and simply reflected the same lack of spirit and self-confidence that seemed to prevail in post-WWII Europe.\n\nBureaucracies are the enemies of innovation and change, and regulation \u2014 which enables bureaucracies to suppress innovation \u2014 is thus the enemy of economic progress.\n\nBut a contrary spirit is still alive in the Republican Party, with wide-spread protests over the last seven years against the regimentation of ObamaCare and the suppression of risk-taking by the Dodd-Frank Act. Many Republican and conservative intellectuals have begun to focus on the growth of the administrative state in the US \u2014 an EU-like unaccountable bureaucracy to which the courts have repeatedly deferred.\n\nHostility to the growth of the administrative state arises from the same view of government that induced the Framers to build a separation of legislative, executive and judicial powers into the US Constitution; they saw this separation as the foundation of liberty. The administrative state is a fourth branch, unrecognized and unrecognizable in the Constitution.\n\nThat the British people should revolt against the power of the EU bureaucracy seems perfectly reasonable in this light, especially to Republicans who still retain a belief in the importance of popular sovereignty and a people\u2019s self-determination.\n\nEven more deeply embedded in Republicanism is the idea that freedom promotes economic progress. Bureaucracies are the enemies of innovation and change, and regulation \u2014 which enables bureaucracies to suppress innovation \u2014 is thus the enemy of economic progress.\n\nWhile the EU\u2019s supporters wring their hands at the uncertainties that Brexit has loosed, those who believe that individual initiative is the ultimate source of progress can only smile at the prospect of what our British cousins will now be able to achieve.",
