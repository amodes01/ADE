    "text": "Britain\u2019s most powerful family \u2014 its royal family \u2014 has taken a neutral stance one one of the most controversial topics in UK history: the Brexit.\n\nWhile the House of Windsor has remained mum on the UK\u2019s departure from the EU, we know that UK Prime Minister David Cameron traveled to Buckingham Palace to resign to the Queen in person.\n\nAccording to the queen and the royal family\u2019s representatives, royals in the UK \u201cabove politics,\u201d and do not vote. In the past, indications of Queen Elizabeth\u2019s political leanings have been met with controversy. In 1986 The Sunday Telegraph wrote a scathing editorial in response to reports that the queen was worried about then-prime minister Margaret Thatcher\u2019s opposition to sanctions against South Africa, as The New York Times noted at the time.\n\n\u201cThese are matters which the monarchy can only meddle with at the institution's gravest peril,\u201d The Telegraph editorial asserted.\n\nAfter the referendum for Scottish independence back in 2014, Cameron let it slip to then-New York mayor Michael Bloomberg that the queen \u201cpurred down the line\u201d when he called her to report that Scotland would indeed be staying in the UK. He issued a public apology for confirming the world\u2019s suspicions that the queen didn\u2019t want Scotland to divorce the UK.\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise that the royals have remained neutral during the whole Brexit debate, though everybody\u2019s been looking for signs of how they really feel.\n\nIn February, Prince William gave a speech to British diplomats at the Foreign Office in London saying, \u201cIn an increasingly turbulent world, our ability to unite in common action with other nations is essential. It is the bedrock of our security and prosperity and is central to your work.\u201d\n\nMany speculated that he was calling for his country to stay in the EU, but Kensington Palace immediately clarified with this statement: \u201cThis speech was not about Europe. He does not mention the word Europe once.\u201d\n\nSo does this officially neutral stance mean the royals must sit idly as they watch their country fall to economic and political uncertainty? Yes and no.\n\nThe royal family provides a point of stability for a very unstable Britain, and can help the country by promoting tourism (which will prove an important job if the pound continues to fall). Approval ratings for the British Monarchy range between 65% and 80%, and their \u201ckeep calm and carry on\u201d attitude could set an example for the rest of the UK. Their power remains unthreatened, and they will continue to attend events and public ceremonies.\n\nThe Queen is 90, and though she is in seemingly good health, there is a worry that she\u2019ll pass away before Brexit negotiations are finished. In that case, the UK may have another referendum, as British Republicans have demanded a vote to end the monarchy in the case of her death.",
