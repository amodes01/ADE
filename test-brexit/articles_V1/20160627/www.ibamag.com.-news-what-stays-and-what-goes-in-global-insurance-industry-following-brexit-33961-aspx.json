    "text": "The UK\u2019s historic vote Thursday to leave the European Union prompted several pressing questions for the global insurance industry, which major players are now beginning to answer.In a rush to assure investors and consumers of their stability, companies from Lloyd\u2019s to XL Catlin have issued statements saying they are fully prepared for the consequences of Brexit, and are equally assured that London will continue as the center for global industry activity.While the long-term effects of the vote are unknown, Lloyd\u2019s of London Chairman John Nelson stressed that the exit will not take place for two years, and that it is likely to take up to a decade for the UK to repeal all EU legislation and regulations \u2013 leaving plenty of time for the industry to adapt.\u201cFor the next two years, our business is unchanged,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cLloyd\u2019s has a well-prepared contingency plan in place and Lloyd\u2019s will be fully equipped to operate in the new environment.\u201dXL Group Chief Executive Mike McGavick made similar comments, saying Brexit is \u201can outcome that we have been preparing for,\u201d and the International Underwriting Association of London called the UK market \u201cresilient and well-positioned to respond to the [referendum] result.\u201dAlready, companies are seeking the ability to passport business services in the EU, a great advantage the UK enjoyed under its membership in the body. So if these efforts win out, and the strength of London\u2019s position in the market will remain \u2013 at least after some initial difficulties \u2013 how will Brexit change the industry?Several analysts are looking to Solvency II, an EU regulatory regime that exercises risk-based capital requirements over companies doing business in the EU. Meant to protect insurance buyers, the rules manage capital, governance and reporting for insurers.David Snyder, vice president of policy development and research for the Property Casualty Insurers Association of America (PCI), sees Britain\u2019s break with the EU as promising for US companies in this regard.\u201cThere\u2019s value in a European common market, in the ability to be admitted once and operate all throughout the EU,\u201d Snyder said. \u201cOn the other hand, Solvency II is creating problems for US insurers [operating] in Europe.\u201dBecause Solvency II deems the US a \u201cnon-equivalent regulatory environment,\u201d the regime has been an issue for companies operating in London and the UK in general.\u201cSolvency II is starting to close markets that have been open to the US,\u201d he said.Frank Nutter, president of the Reinsurance Association of America, believes the EU Referendum vote may provide the perfect opportunity to redouble efforts to achieve the free flow of capital and risk transfer in cross-border business, a goal that has been dislodged somewhat by EU regulations.\u201cThe impact of Solvency II, and now Brexit, has fostered some uncertainty for US-based companies doing business in EU countries,\u201d Nutter said in a statement. \u201cIn light of the Brexit vote, it is important for the covered agreement negotiations between the US and EU to remain a top and immediate priority among all concerned parties. Such an agreement can resolve uncertainty and set a precedent for future regulatory agreements.\u201dYet not everyone agrees that Brexit will mean changes for Solvency II and its application to insurers doing business in the UK. Daniel Bruce, director at Crowe Horwath LLP and co-founder of consulting firm BaxterBruce, expects these requirements to remain, particularly given the UK\u2019s role in the drafting process.\u201cThe UK has been a key player in formulating Solvency II requirement and we expect that the Prudential Regulatory Authority will be keen to proceed on a similar path,\u201d Bruce said, adding that he expects requirements to remain both in the two-year negotiating period and in the long term.In fact, he anticipates an increase in oversight from regulatory authorities, both from Prudential and the UK\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority.\u201cIn particular, the PRA will be keen on insurance companies ensuring that their stress and scenario testing is up to date and reflective of the current economic and political environment,\u201d Bruce said. \u201cThey will expect remedial management actions to be taken, as and where necessary, to maintain ongoing solvency.\u201d",
