    "text": "Last week the world went batcrap crazy\u2026..you see Britain voted to leave the EU and that set off days of speculation by the media\u2026.especially who would be the next nation to choose the path of exit\u2026\u2026will it be Greece (my choice) or maybe Holland or Italy or Denmark\u2026even France because they were never completely on board with the whole EU thingy\u2026\u2026\n\nI could write about these wannabes but instead I would like to write about the \u201cexit\u201d thing here in the US.\n\nI know what could I possibly be talking about, right?\n\nTexas fools!\n\nHow many times has the subject come up in the news with Texas attached to it?\n\nAfter the \u201cBrexit\u201d vote and all the news coverage and all the worthless speculation\u2026.the whole secession thing has once again come up and Texas center\u2026\u2026.\n\nNot content with celebrating liberty on July 4, a group of Texans has gleaned inspiration from Brexit\u2014the UK\u2019s decision to leave the EU\u2014with its own push for independence. The similar-sounding \u201cTexit\u201d movement, which gained significant support online Friday, is mainly being pushed by the Texas Nationalist Movement, which is basically the US soulmate of the UK secession initiative, according to its leader, David Miller, right down to the \u201cLeave\u201d campaign slogan that TNM says it\u2019s been using for years. With a motto of \u201cTexas First, Texas Forever,\u201d the group, like those behind Brexit, advocates for \u201cself-government,\u201d Miller tells News.com.au. \u201cAt this moment, we don\u2019t enjoy that right,\u201d he says. \u201cThe vast majority of the laws, rules, and regulations that affect the people of Texas are created by the political class or unelected bureaucrats in Washington.\u201d Vocativ decided to see how often the phrase \u201cTexit\u201d has been used in 2016 and found that online references spiked after the Brexit tally came in. Nearly 1,800 people tweeted something Texit-related in the hour of the announcement, with thousands more tweets following. Some of the posts are frighteningly serious, others are somewhat clever (cue the \u201cmost likely to secede\u201d memes), and still others can\u2019t do anything but virtually shake their heads. It\u2019s not the first time some of the state\u2019s residents have vied for a breakaway: Right after President Obama\u2019s reelection, the White House turned down a petition signed by 125,000 people calling for Texas\u2019 freedom, Fox News reported. One Texit supporter tells the Guardian that a secession would bring back \u201cTexas solutions\u201d on issues such as gay marriage, gun rights, and immigration. (Here, a fewlegaltakes on secession rules.)\n\nI am sick of hearing this crap from Texas\u2026I say if they like then by God let\u2019s let them go\u2026\u2026but first build that Trump wall around the state and only put in a couple of in and out gates\u2026.and then we will see just how serious these fools are about leaving the union\u2026\u2026\n\nIf they do not want to be part of the US then let the f*ckers go! I am sick of listening to these whiney twats\u2026\u2026let them GO!",
