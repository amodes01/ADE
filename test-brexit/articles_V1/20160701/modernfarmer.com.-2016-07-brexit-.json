    "text": "Known by the somewhat cutesy name of \u201cBrexit,\u201d many UK farmers feel the move is anything but cute. The National Farmers Union, which represents around 55,000 farmers in England and Wales, was against breaking with the EU from the start. Its president, Meurig Raymond, called the vote\u2019s result a \u201cpolitical car crash,\u201d warning it could lead to increased food prices due to a weakened pound and the UK\u2019s reliance on imports, according to The Independent newspaper.\n\nThe effects upon UK farmers covers a broad swath of issues \u2013 including the potential loss of subsidies, markets, and a ready labor pool \u2013 and travels across a range of products, from dairy, to arable crops, to livestock. A vital issue is the subsidies, which UK farmers enjoyed under the EU. Without these supports, farmers already near the brink (due to British supermarkets\u2019 artificially low prices for staples, like milk) could go under. According to Mike Thomas, a spokesman for the NFU, the organization wants to ensure the independent UK government will continue to provide similar supports for the agricultural sector.\n\nToday the NFU\u2019s governing body held an internal meeting to determine next steps, or as Thomas puts it, to \u201cput some flesh on the bones\u201d of what they want in the wake of the decision to leave the EU, including achieving the best possible access to European markets; continued access to the rest of the world\u2019s markets (while ensuring the UK won\u2019t be flooded by cheap imports made with lower standards); continued availability of foreign labor; and crafting a British agricultural policy that is simple, flexible, and leaves British farmers on a level playing field with EU farmers.\n\n\u201cThe vote to leave the European Union will inevitably lead to a period of uncertainty in a number of areas that are of vital importance to Britain\u2019s farmers,\u201d Thomas tells Modern Farmer in an email. \u201cOur members will rightly want to know the impact on their businesses as a matter of urgency. We understand that the negotiations will take some time to deliver, but it is vital that there is early commitment to ensure British farming is not disadvantaged. British farming is the bedrock of the food industry \u2013 Britain\u2019s largest manufacturing sector.\u201d\n\nNot everyone agrees leaving the EU will have negative effects, however. In February, before the referendum, British author, journalist, and former farmer, Nigel Farndale penned a piece for The Spectator, in which he argues that leaving the EU could save Britain \u00a33 billion ($3.97 billion) a year while maintaining the same amount of farming subsidies currently supporting British farmers. He writes, \u201cJust to continue paying farmers the same subsidy as they are getting now would cost the British taxpayer half as much, because, at present, we pay \u00a36 billion [$7.95 billion] a year into the CAP [Common Agricultural Policy, an EU program meant to increase agricultural productivity and ensure farmers receive a fair income, among other aims], but our farmers get only \u00a33 billion back. British farmers are effectively subsidising their competitors: the French, by far the biggest beneficiary of the CAP, receive three times as much.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, says Farndale, UK farmers could become more competitive on the world stage without being mired in the red tape that comes from being a member of the European Union.\n\nProfessor Patrick Minford, an economist and former advisor to Margaret Thatcher, who teaches at Cardiff University, also believes Brexit will be good for farmers. \u201cWe\u2019d stop listening to French farmers and instead the UK would help struggling farmers in our own country stand on their own two feet while protecting our beautiful rural environment in different ways,\u201d he wrote in an op ed piece in The Sun.\n\nWhile the future of the UK agricultural sector in the face of these major changes is uncertain, Thomas says this is the moment farmers need to work together to not just ensure a smooth transition out of the EU, but to decide where they want their agriculture sector to head in the long term.\n\n\u201cThis is about planning a UK food and farming plan that is fit for the future and builds strong foundations for the young people who want to enter into the industry,\u201d he says. \u201cThe loss of state aid rules will mean that we can be really ambitious in our plans for promoting and marketing British food for retail, public procurement, and to the export market.\u201d\u009d\n\nUK farmers and British shoppers will be watching Brexit unfold with bated breath, as will American farmers hoping to find a new export opportunity.",
