    "text": "Britain\u2019s decision to leave the European Union sent shock waves of volatility through global financial markets, but Eric Schmidt is keeping his cool.\n\nThe executive chairman of Alphabet, parent company of Google, told an audience at the Viva Technology conference in Paris, France that he doesn\u2019t foresee Brexit affecting his business in serious way, or forcing him to move employees from Britain to countries still in the European Union.\u201dI think it\u2019s unlikely Google will change our allocation \u2026 we have large operations in Ireland in Britain in France, in Germany \u2026 you never know, but it\u2019d be hard for me to imagine we would make much of a change,\u201d Schmidt said, according to a report on CNBC.\n\nThe decision of British voters last week to leave the European Union took place during a referendum that wasn\u2019t legally binding, though leaders of the U.K.\u2019s ruling conservative party have said they will respect the will of the voters and ultimately move to extricate their country from EU membership. But the details of what exactly that means remain unclear.\n\nSome in the U.K. would like to keep the nation in the European Economic Area, which would allow British businesses to keep access to the single European market, but would force the country to accept immigrants from other EU countries, a dynamic that motivated much of the anger Brits felt toward the union.\n\nA more thorough breakup would enable Parliament to set its own immigration limits but would imperil the trade relationship between the U.K. and the rest of Europe. It\u2019s this second scenario that has business leaders in London most concerned, and it\u2019s motivated executives from companies like Vodafone to consider moving their operations from London to the European continent.\n\nFortune has reached out to Google and will update the story if the company responds.",
