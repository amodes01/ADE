    "text": "Earlier this year, the Guardian sought out Bernie Sanders supporters who said they would rather vote for Donald Trump than Hillary Clinton. Surveys at the time suggested a small proportion of Sanders fans, 7%, were willing to make such a switch.\n\n\n\nWe decided to go back to 150 of the 500 or so supporters who contacted us to see if Britain\u2019s decision to leave the European Union had made them more or less likely to favor the Republican Trump over the Democrat Clinton. Our thinking was that the economic and political turmoil caused by the success of a campaign based on nationalistic, anti-immigration sentiment led by a charismatic rightwing leader might have prompted some second thoughts.\n\n\n\nSanders penned an op-ed for the New York Times this week urging the Democrats to bring struggling working-class disaffected voters into the party fold rather than pushing them towards Trump. So what was this group of Sanders supporters thinking, post-Brexit?\n\nAbout 50 responses were received. Some said they were no longer considering switching to Trump. About half backed Brexit, half opposed it.\n\nMost of those who were still switching to Trump said they saw the Brexit result as vindication of their decision to back the Republican. Except in one case, those who opposed Brexit did not feel inspired to change their voting behavior in the wake of the UK\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201c[The] outcome only concretes my vote for Trump, because I think in the long run it will do us good rather than harm, just like this Brexit vote,\u201d wrote Peter Kartachian, a 34-year-old machinist from California. \u201cThese Chicken Littles who are claiming the world is ending because of this will soon be shown to be the empty suits that they are.\u201d\n\nIn at least two cases, Brexit has flipped previously unsure voters into the Trump column. One New York woman, Janet H, who asked for her surname not to be used as she didn\u2019t want her family to know she is backing Trump, said she\u2019d been leaning towards the Republican candidate until his racist comments about a judge of Mexican origin led her to switch, begrudgingly, to Clinton. \u201cThen Brexit happened,\u201d said Janet H. She continued:\n\nAs I was watching I felt a kinship with \u2013 and an admiration for \u2013 those in Britain who stood up to the taunting and shaming and voted to leave. They took their country back from Brussels and the elite establishment. Even now they are being shamed! But I was proud of them for going ahead. It made me think twice. I\u2019d like to take my country back again too. I\u2019d like to take it back from the elites and the establishment and the politically correct in my country ... But if I do decide to vote for Trump I won\u2019t tell anyone. I\u2019ll let them think I\u2019m voting for Hillary.\n\nDan Lutts, a 70-year-old museum official, also said the UK\u2019s decision had pushed him more towards the Republican. \u201cI think the Brexit vote makes me more inclined to vote for Trump than to write in Sanders\u2019 name or vote for a third-party candidate. Maybe Trump would take us out of Nafta and actually kill the TPP [Trans-Pacific Partnership],\u201d he wrote.\n\nBoth a vote in favor of Brexit and a vote for Trump \u201crepresent a rebellion against a political ideology and intellectual strait jacket that does not work\u201d, said Colin Wright, a 58-year-old retiree from Hawaii. He added:\n\nWe \u2013 or at least I \u2013 will freely grant that Donald Trump on the one hand and Brexit on the other may not work either, but we have to try something, and just as in the US Hillary Clinton represents continuing along the same path that has so far yielded increasingly dismal results, so remaining in the EU offered the same uninspiring choice to Britons.\n\nJohn Bolger, a 26-year-old software developer from New York City, noted the similarities between Trump and the Brexit campaign. He wrote:\n\nThe Brexit shows that the establishment, and the establishment media that parrots it, is completely out of touch with the population they purport to represent. The unheard masses are rejecting the establishment in the only way the current system allows them to. For better or for worse, the Brexit is the product of years of establishment suppression, and it is a global phenomena that is far from over.\n\nAnd while he didn\u2019t personally support Trump, he noted: \u201cIf Trump causes the White House to burn, it will be a stronger and wiser America that raises from the ashes, and so be it.\u201d\n\nOnly one respondent said watching the result of Brexit motivated him to back Clinton.\n\n\n\n\u201cBrexit will impact my behavior in that I will give more money to Democrats down ballot, vote for Hillary, and I am considering making calls and canvassing for her if I have time, which might be unlikely,\u201d said Farzad Abdollahi, 39, who owns a manufacturer business.\n\n\n\nHe even hoped it would challenge Sanders voters who have switched to Trump. \u201cIf anything, this will shake up the Bernie voters seeing what a disaster Brexit looks like it is going to be,\u201d added Abdollahi, from California. But from our informal poll, he was the only one flipped over to Team Clinton.",
