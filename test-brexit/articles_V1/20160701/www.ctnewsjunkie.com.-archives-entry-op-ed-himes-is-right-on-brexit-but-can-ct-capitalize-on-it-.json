    "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nThe shockwaves felt by the United Kingdom\u2019s stunning decision to leave the European Union reverberated around the world late last week, eventually finding their way to Connecticut. Interestingly, few public officials here have come forward to comment extensively on one of the most important European policy decisions in decades.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to know precisely what Connecticut\u2019s congressional delegation is thinking since House websites have been down for maintenance for the last several days. Perhaps they\u2019ve been too busy helping to stage the much-publicized sit-in for gun control legislation to weigh in on this momentous move. Or perhaps they think we Nutmeggers are bored by foreign policy or that we\u2019re preoccupied with the impending holiday commemorating our own independence to consider events across the pond. And as far as I can tell, neither of our senators has weighed in on this.\n\nStepping up to the plate to fill the void was U.S. Rep. Jim Himes. As was the case with the FBI\u2019s attempt to force Apple to unlock San Bernardino terrorist Syed Farook\u2019s iPhone, the Democratic congressman from the 4th District is willing to go where others in the state\u2019s congressional delegation fear to tread.\n\nIn an interview with MSNBC the day after the vote, Himes said he was \u201cvery disappointed by the decision taken by a very slim majority of the British public.\u201d He blamed it partly on older voters, whereas \u201cthe millennials, the people in London, understand what the markets are saying today that this is a very bad thing for the U.K.\u201d\n\nHimes knows something about international trade. Born in Peru, Himes speaks fluent Spanish and was a vice president at Goldman Sachs, working as a banker in Latin America and New York. He sits on the House Committee on Financial Services and the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.\n\nHimes correctly theorized that Scotland, which narrowly voted not to secede from the U.K. in 2014, might now want to reconsider that vote in light of the fact that Scotland overwhelmingly voted to stay in the EU, while the country it wanted to secede from voted to do the opposite by four percentage points.\n\nBut perhaps more importantly was the effect Brexit had on the financial markets, which \u201chave been devastated,\u201d Himes said, as the British pound suffered its largest single-day loss in history.\n\n\u201cMarkets speak,\u201d said Himes, who was working at Goldman Sachs during the Asian financial crisis.\n\nHimes then held forth on the right-wing isolationist in European politics that drove the Brexit, adding that \u201cthis is where that xenophobic angry right-wing dark instinct takes you.\u201d He had harsh words for Nigel Farage, the leader of the pro-Brexit UK Independence Party, whom he accused of \u201ccompletely reneging on the financial promises\u201d his party had made.\n\nI\u2019m not sure I agree completely with Himes on right-wing politics being the only culprit here. To be sure, xenophobia, isolationism, and an anti-immigrant backlash were key factors. But if you believe former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, it was a \u201cconvergence of the far left and far right. The right attacks immigrants while the left rails at bankers.\u201d Indeed, the Brexit opposition of left-wing Labor Party leader Jeremy Corbyn was lukewarm. That, in part, has led to a political crisis within his own party and to calls for his resignation.\n\nHere at home, it remains to be seen whether Brexit will have an effect on Connecticut. Stamford is home to a number of branch offices of large European financial institutions such as the Royal Bank of Scotland and UBS, a global financial services company headquartered in Switzerland.\n\nAccording to the Stamford Chamber of Commerce, \u201cStamford is the biggest international trade center between New York and Boston.\u201d\n\nUConn economist Fred Carstensen told Hearst that \u201cthere are [European] managers that may well decide that the U.S. is a better place from which to operate, at least in the short run.\u201d But don\u2019t get your hopes up that they will flock to Connecticut.\n\n\u201cConnecticut could capture some significant growth opportunities, if it were prepared,\u201d Carstensen said. \u201cBut Connecticut is not well prepared. It is so consumed with the budget crisis that it is hard to find enough attention to make it more economically competitive.\u201d\n\nThank you, Fred, for cutting through the fog once again. Failure begets failure. And until Connecticut\u2019s leaders can find a way to make our state more competitive and attractive to new businesses, they will mostly stay away unless we bribe them with special deals. Perhaps Greenwich and other parts of Fairfield County want to exit the state. I know some hedge fund managers who would gladly vote for the Grexit.\n\nContributing op-ed columnist Terry Cowgill lives in Lakeville, blogs at ctdevilsadvocate.com and is news editor of The Berkshire Record in Great Barrington, Mass.
