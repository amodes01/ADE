We will see how they all put democratic principles into practice.\u201d\n\nIs Brexit good for Russia?\n\nSome European politicians have called for the UK to implement Article 50 and start the process of leaving the EU immediately but the move has not yet been debated in the Houses of Parliament.\n\nThe narrow margin in last week's vote sparked calls for a second referendum by Remain voters but the Prime Minister said the result was final and would be respected.\n\nSpeaking in Moscow on Thursday, Mr Putin noted that the EU was \u201cnot having an easy time right now\u201d but predicted that instability in \u201crattled\u201d markets would be resolved in the medium term.\n\nRussia hopes to establish a \u201ccommon economic and humanitarian space\u201d in co-operation with Europe and will work with the next American President, whether Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton win the contest, he added.\n\nMr Putin also called for Russian diplomacy to take \u201ca more active part\u201d in current conflicts, including the Syrian civil war, as well as fighting terrorism and protesting national interests.\n\nHe hit out against a \u201cgrowing barrage of information attacks unleashed against Russia\u201d and said it would challenge the \u201cWestern media\u2019s information monopoly\u201d.\n\nThere has been speculation that the Russian President would relish the prospect of turmoil within the EU amid frosty relations over Ukraine and his intervention in support of Bashar al-Assad.\n\nSpeaking at the World Economic Forum last month, David Cameron said: \u201cWho would be happy if we left? Putin might be happy, I suspect al-Baghdadi might be happy.\u201d\n\nMr Putin responded by saying the claim had \u201cno basis\u201d and were an attempt to influence British voters ahead of the referendum on 23 June.\n\nHe slammed the Government\u2019s approach to the election as \u201cnothing more than overconfidence and a superficial approach to solving fateful decisions for one's country\u201d following the shock vote for a Brexit.\n\nTies between Russia and the EU are at their lowest point since the Cold War after a series of sanctions and counter-sanctions over Moscow\u2019s alleged role in the Ukraine crisis.",
