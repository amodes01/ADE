    "text": "A post-Brexit survey by the Institute of Directors, the United Kingdom\u2019s longest running organization for business leaders, found 22% of the respondents are considering moving some of their operations outside of the U.K. Of those considering an operations shift, most anticipate a move to another EU country.\n\n\u201cShould I stay or should I go,\u201d a refrain from The Clash\u2019s 1982 rock anthem, is on the minds of corporate decision-makers with major operations in the U.K. These concerns are keeping site selection consultants, a select breed of counselors who advise large and mid-size companies on location strategies, exceptionally busy. \u201cOur phones have been ringing since the day after the vote,\u201d according to Darin Buelow, a Principal with Deloitte Consulting LLP. \u201cThere is a tremendous amount of uncertainty right now. It\u2019s a very complex situation and we\u2019ve been advising our clients to sit tight for the moment.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s been one week since the news of the U.K. \u201cleave\u201d vote. That makes it a good time to speak with a panel of four respected site selection consultants for their views on the fallout and their assessment of the cities and countries likely to see an increase in foreign direct investment as a result.\n\nMost of their observations focused on specific industry clusters:\n\nFinancial Services: Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, HSBC and Morgan-Stanley are among the major banks rumored to be weighing relocation options for at least a portion of their London-based offices. From a regulatory perspective, most of these jobs need to remain in the European Union.\n\nOur site consultant panel picked cities with established financial sectors \u2013 Dublin, Paris, Amsterdam and Frankfurt \u2013 as likely winners. But the Grand Dutchy of Luxembourg \u2013 a country with the second smallest population in the EU but a vibrant banking sector \u2013 is also on the consultant\u2019s radar.\n\nInformation Technology: The IT cluster has been the U.K.\u2019s fastest growing sector with London accounting for more than 250,000 technology workers. \u201cTechnology investment is all about talent,\u201d according to Wouter Schuitemaker, Managing Director, EMEA at Hickey & Associates. \u201cThe recent vote sends a negative message to Britain\u2019s technology workers that hail from outside the U.K. Many may opt to return home or go to other EU cities with strong technology sectors.\u201d\n\nDublin, Paris and Amsterdam again make the list of top contenders. But so do Munich, Berlin and Stockholm. Estonia, an EU country that is the birthplace of the highly popular Skype, is a dark horse candidate for tech investment. India and the Philippines have also emerged as strong options outside of the EU.\n\nManufacturing: Our panel of consultants see a range of options including Spain and Italy (which has a lower cost structure than the U.K.) and Germany (known for exceptionally high productivity). \u201cEastern Bloc countries like the Czech Republic and Hungary also have a good story to tell,\u201d according to Douglas Van den Berghe, CEO, Investment Consulting Associates (ICA).\n\nFinally, let\u2019s turn to the potential battleground for highly sought-after European headquarters operations. Buck Consultants International (BCI), an independent consulting firm, conducted a pre-vote survey of American companies with a European headquarters in the U.K. One in eight companies indicated it is likely they will move their headquarters to a different city as a result of a \u201cleave\u201d vote. The top three countries likely to be considered in a headquarters move were the Netherlands (61%), Ireland (45%) and Switzerland (45%).\n\nAccording to Rene Buck, Director at BCI, \u201cThere is panic in the boardroom and companies are developing contingency plans right now. You can\u2019t expect a company to wait around for two years of bureaucratic negotiations between the EU and Great Britain.\u201d\n\nWatch on Forbes:",
