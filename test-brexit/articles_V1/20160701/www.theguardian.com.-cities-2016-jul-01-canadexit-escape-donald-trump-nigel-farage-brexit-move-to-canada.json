    "text": "In the wake of Brexit and with the rise of Donald Trump, Richard Nixon now seems like a quaint historical curiosity. Were Tricky Dicky\u2019s revivified corpse to shamble on stage at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland later this month to demand the nomination, it would probably be hailed as an improvement. However, there was a time when decent Americans saw Nixon as an unprecedented threat to democracy.\n\nOne of those Americans was my grandfather. When Nixon was elected vice-president in 1952, my grandfather made good on that perennial threat of outraged American liberals throughout history: he loaded the family into the station wagon, drove up the coast from Orange County to Salmon Arm, British Columbia, and settled in Canada.\n\n\n\nSo it\u2019s in part thanks to Nixon that I now live and work in Toronto, having carried on the family tradition of making existential life decisions without thinking them through by using my Canadian passport to move from Australia. The Canada I moved to seven years ago was thought of as a pleasant backwater: cold, bland.\n\nBut Canada has become something very different. For one thing, Canada now has Drake, and a prime minister who can credibly claim to have had sex. For another, the US and the UK are voting their way toward national cosplays of Children of Men, and the less credulous among their populations are eyeing the exits.\n\nGoogle searches for 'how do I move to Canada' spiked in the UK following the Brexit vote\n\nGoogle searches for \u201chow do I move to Canada\u201d spiked in the UK following the Brexit vote, in inverse correlation to the value of the pound. Trump has already begun challenging his critics to make the move, perhaps anticipating the gulags (fabulous gulags, the best gulags) he will establish in our frozen north.\n\nThough frequently cited as an empty threat, it\u2019s not unreasonable for Brits and Yanks anticipating a future transatlantic summit between God-Emperors Trump and Farage to contemplate a move to Canada. Many have come before.\n\nView image in fullscreen ... run away! Photograph: AP\n\nOur first wave of disgruntled immigrants crossed the Bering Land Bridge into North America some 40,000 years ago, although history doesn\u2019t record the identity of the neanderthal real estate tycoon they were fleeing. Their First Nations ancestors were later displaced by Americans, loyal to the British crown, who fled the Revolutionary War. During the 19th century, somewhere between 30,000 and 100,000 escaped slaves made their way to Canada on the Underground Railroad.\n\n\n\nIn the early 1900s they were followed in turn by the Doukhobors, a pacifist Russian sect who fled oppression in their homeland and resettled in the prairies of western Canada. Upon experiencing the reality of life in the prairies of western Canada, the Doukhobors regretted their decision, and devised a plan to return to Russia: they would force the Canadian government to repatriate them by stripping naked and setting fire to their own houses. Canadians are a patient people, but only to a point. The most devout of the Doukhoubors now live in Azerbaijan.\n\nThe next great wave of refugees arrived in the late 1960s and early 70s, when between 50,000 and 100,000 Americans chose to live in Canada rather than to fight in the Vietnam War. Deserters from America\u2019s subsequent wars continue to seek refuge here, as do Syrian refugees fleeing the consequences of those same wars.\n\nSo, how to move? And can it be done before Michael Gove and Donald Trump begin fumbling with launch codes in their sweaty fists?\n\nIt\u2019s not as easy as you might think. Americans with professional degrees can live and work in Canada with relative ease under Nafta, but for everyone else, the best strategy, as in all aspects of life, is to be hot. If you\u2019re married to or live with a Canadian citizen for a minimum of one year, they can sponsor you to become a permanent resident. In the era of the internet, seducing and then marrying a Canadian is easier than ever, and regardless of how unexceptional you were in your country of origin you will likely appear exotic to a Canadian. Act quickly, while your passport and currency still holds out some value to a potential partner.\n\nView image in fullscreen John Lennon and Yoko Ono spent one week in bed in Montreal\u2019s Queen Elizabeth Hotel to promote peace during the Vietnam War. Photograph: Gerry Deiter/AFP/Getty Images\n\nFor those without sexual capital, Canada offers an opaque, points-based visa system that takes into account language proficiency, education, skills and family ties, and which my Venezuelan Spanish teacher assures me is muy Kafkaesque. Quotas apply, the application process can take years, and the system is weighted heavily toward middle-class professionals. While UK citizens might reasonably assume that our shared aristocracy would give them an advantage here, this is not the case. They are in fact subject to the same eligibility criteria as Americans \u2013 all the more reason to get the applications in before Trump\u2019s thousand-year reich begins in November.\n\nThose who don\u2019t manage to escape the UK and the US immediately should consider taking advantage of Canada\u2019s refugee asylum system. While more humane than Europe and Australia\u2019s strategy of hoping the boats sink in someone else\u2019s waters, it is by no means perfect. The application process for Syrian refugees, for example, is also weighted towards middle-class professionals. Unaccompanied males are excluded.\n\nShould your application nevertheless be successful, you then need to decide where to settle. It\u2019s not an exaggeration to say that 98% of Canada is a frozen wasteland. Of the remaining 2%:\n\nVancouver\n\nCanada\u2019s only beautiful city has already been rendered unaffordable by the same borderless capital flows whose panicked stampedes are about to devastate London. Suitable for aspirational fregan employees of weed dispensaries and 17-year-old Lamborghini-driving daughters of Chinese Communist Party officials.\n\nView image in fullscreen So wealthy they have their own reality show ... Vancouver\u2019s Ultra Rich Asian Girls. Photograph: HBICtv\n\nCalgary\n\nThe birthplace of Ted Cruz, Calgary is to Dallas as your local Chinatown is to China. Perfect for #NeverTrump Americans who like their hats big, their politics pro-life, and their carbon emissions uncapped and un-traded.\n\nSt John\u2019s\n\nNewfoundland is the Ireland of Canada, and its capital\u2019s friendly and incomprehensible inhabitants make it a good place to wait out a civilisational collapse.\n\nMontreal\n\nMuch like the EU, Canada has its own group of plucky and troublesome separatists, willing to cripple their economy in a quixotic defence of the specialness of their culture. Brits spoiling for a second Brexit, or those nostalgic for the experience of being sneered at by Parisians for trying to speak French and eager to recreate that experience in a colder climate, should consider making Montreal their home.\n\nOttawa\n\nCanada\u2019s seat of government is everything you would expect of \u201cCanada\u2019s seat of government\u201d. Ideal for those who enjoy sitting and governing.\n\nQuebec City\n\nMontreal with less culture or vice, Ville de Qu\u00e9bec is the perfect place to resettle any elderly Francophile aunts.\n\nToronto\n\nCanada\u2019s largest city is now best-known for the antics of its late mayor, beloved domestic abuser and crack addict Rob Ford. His brief reign so ashamed Torontonians that they promptly elected a man so boring that his name is actually \u201cJohn Tory\u201d, and whose soporific public persona might be particularly reassuring to Trump/Johnson refugees.\n\nAs for those of us already here, I think I\u2019m safe in saying that we are conflicted by Canada\u2019s status as a refuge for the politically dissatisfied. On one hand, we would prefer that control of the US and UK governments not fall into the hands of populist demagogues. On the other, periodic influxes of liberals are an electoral bulwark against their rise in our own country. On behalf of Canada, let me assure you that you\u2019re welcome here, but politely suggest that you consider standing and fighting.",
