    "text": "We reported on June 1 that Donald Trump apparently has no idea what the Brexit is and today, on the eve of Britain's referendum vote, we bring you an update: Donald Trump still has basically no idea what the Brexit is.\n\nWhen asked Wednesday how he feels about the possibility of the United Kingdom leaving the EU, Trump said it was his \"inclination\" that they should get out. But \"I don't think anybody should listen to me [because] I haven't really focused on it very much,\" the potential next leader of the free world said.\n\nOn Thursday, Britain will decide whether to remain or leave the EU, a decision that has threatened to divide Europe. The implications are radical for the United States: Following World War II, the EU brought stability and order to Europe, and as a single unit it has helped the U.S. with geopolitical responsibilities around the world. On the economic front alone, President Obama has urged against a Brexit, saying it could take as many as 10 years for Britain to negotiate new trade deals with the States.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.
