    "text": "Investors and markets around the world are on edge as Britain decides whether it will stay in the European Union. The uncertainty around the future of Europe as we know it sent markets tumbling last week, and the CBOE volatility index, a measure of investor fear, spiked.\n\nInvestors have significant positions in foreign funds these days. Over the last decade, investors poured $643 billion into world stock funds, while they pulled $834 billion out of U.S. stock funds, according to the Investment Company Institute\u2019s 2016 Fact Book. So they\u2019re naturally concerned about how the so-called Brexit could affect their portfolios.\n\nSome investors have recently sold their foreign funds. \u201cInvestors pulled $1.1 billion from U.K. equity funds in the week to yesterday, according to data from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. This was the fastest rate of withdrawals in 13 months,\u201d according to data from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. This was the fastest rate of withdrawals in 13 months,\u201d according to The Street.\n\nBut we know that the best returns come from staying invested long term. Those who sell out of the market today will have to decide when to get invested again, and history shows that by the time investors feel ready to get back in the market, they\u2019ve often missed out on significant gains.\n\nDon\u2019t let uncertainty hold you back\n\nOften investors wait to see how things progress, but this assumes that eventually they\u2019ll feel more certain about where the market\u2019s headed. The reality is that uncertainty is part of investing, just like it\u2019s part of life, and as investors, we have to come to terms with uncertainty if we hope to get ahead.\n\nEven after Thursday\u2019s vote, there will still be uncertainty. If Britain votes to leave the E.U., there will be two years of negotiations on the terms of the separation. And even then, we won\u2019t know how Britain and the E.U. will do on their own. So if you need to be invested to reach your goals, then get invested. Don\u2019t let the uncertainty of a Brexit hold you back from doing the work you need to do to get ahead.\n\nInvest in what you know now -- and adapt as markets change\n\nFocus on what you know now. You know why you\u2019re invested and what you\u2019re trying to accomplish. For most of us, investing isn\u2019t just about money, it\u2019s about having the freedom to live the life we want\u2014to retire on our schedule, to give our kids the option to go to the college of their choice. These goals aren\u2019t tied to the result of the British referendum.\n\nYou also know that over the long term\u2014even through times of global crisis and political upheaval\u2014investing in stocks has been the best way to make money. The volatility of stocks makes it tough to hold stocks long enough to benefit from their terrific long-term results, but if you stick it out, those gains can change your life.\n\nAnother thing you probably know is how different areas of the market have been performing lately and, long before the Brexit, Europe wasn\u2019t performing well. Most Europe funds and ETFs have been out of favor for some time now; the iShares MSCI Eurozone ETF (EZU) has lagged the S&P 500 for the last three years running, and my firm\u2019s Upgrading strategy has kept us out of these funds.\n\nU.S. funds are currently in favor\n\nDecades of academic research and a January 2016 Morningstar study have found that funds that have done well recently tend to continue to do well for the next few months or even years . At the moment, that means U.S. stock funds. And funds that haven\u2019t performed well tend to remain out of favor for some time. Academics call this \u201cpersistence of performance.\u201d\n\nTo capitalize on persistence of performance, I invest in funds that have strong recent returns, and that\u2019s led me to own U.S. funds for the last few years. I\u2019ve largely avoided foreign funds, not because of the possible Brexit, but simply because foreign funds haven\u2019t done as well.\n\nKeep a global focus\n\nBut don\u2019t write off Europe entirely. Markets change over time, and these changes are often different than anyone expects. While Europe hasn\u2019t been a good place to invest lately, sooner or later, it should come back into favor. When that happens, I\u2019ll be happy to buy back in. For now, though, there are clearly better gains to be made here at home.",
