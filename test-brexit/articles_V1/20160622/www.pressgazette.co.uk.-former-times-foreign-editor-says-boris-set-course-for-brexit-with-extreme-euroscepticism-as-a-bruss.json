    "text": "Former Times foreign editor Martin Fletcher has claimed Boris Johnson, in his former role as a Brussels correspondent for The Daily Telegraph, helped create a narrative for Brexit.\n\nIn a comment piece in the New York Times , published online yesterday, he claims the Conservative MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip made his name in Brussels \u201cwith extreme Euroscepticism, tirelessly attacking, mocking and denigrating the European Union\u201d.\n\nFletcher, who was appointed to report on the European Union for The Times in 1999 shortly after Johnson had returned to London (he covered the Brussels beat from 1989 to 1994), says he had to \u201clive with the consequences\u201d of Johnson\u2019s reporting approach.\n\nHe said the former Mayor of London\u2019s dispatches on the EU were \u201cundoubtedly colourful\u201d, including writing about \u201cEuropean Union plans to take over Europe, ban Britain\u2019s favourite potato chips, standardise condom sizes and blow up its own asbestos-filled headquarters\u201d.\n\nRelated\n\nBut he said: \u201cBy the time I arrived in Brussels, editors wanted only reports about faceless Eurocrats dictating the shape of the cucumbers that could be sold in Britain, or plots to impose a European superstate, or British prime ministers fighting plucky rear-guard actions against a hostile Continent.\n\n\u201cMuch of the British press seemed unable to view the European Union through any other prism. These narratives reflected and exploited the innate nationalism, historical sense of superiority and disdain for Johnny Foreigner of many readers.\u201d\n\nPress Gazette analysis has shown that national newspapers have predominantly come out in favour of Britain leaving the EU. Britain goes to the polls tomorrow to vote on whether to leave or remain in the European Union.\n\n(Picture: Shutterstock)\n\nEmail pged@pressgazette.co.uk to point out mistakes, provide story tips or send in a letter for publication on our \"Letters Page\" blog",
