    "text": "The people of Britain have spoken, and by a miniscule margin, voted to leave the European Union. We all know what this could mean for the economy, immigration, jobs, fishing and even VISA-free travel, but what does Brexit mean for technology?\n\nTech is big business for the United Kingdom. The UK\u2019s IT industry is worth \u00a358 billion to the economy annually. London-based tech firms alone raised \u00a31.09 billion in venture capital last year. There are 42.4 million smartphone users in the UK, and that\u2019s steadily rising. We\u2019re the world\u2019s fifth biggest economy, and technology and science make up a big part of that.\n\nLeaving the EU will have consequences for every sector, and technology is no exception. No one can say for certain what will happen when (presumably) leave, however Norway \u2013 who chose not to enter the EU in 1994 and was often cited as an example by pro-Brexit campaigners \u2013 delivered a warning that being alone is not all fun and games.\n\nOf course the politicians can be wrong, the experts can be wrong, and the business leaders can be wrong \u2013 this is new territory. They can also be right, and some of the world\u2019s most influential technologists have been quite vocal about the EU referendum.\n\nRelated: 4 ways Brexit is melting the internet\n\nWhat are big tech companies saying?\n\nThere\u2019s no shortage of corporate bigwigs wading in on the EU debate, and that\u2019s a good thing. When it comes to Brexit, it\u2019s important to get a view of what our country\u2019s biggest technology business leaders believe will happen. It\u2019s their livelihoods on the line, after all.\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise that the Remain camp has garnered the lion\u2019s share of support from big business. The majority of UK exports to the EU, across both services and manufacturing, can largely (though not exclusively) be sourced to the major corporations.\n\nSome of the key tech players throwing their lot in with Remain include: Bill Gates (Founder of Microsoft), Richard Branson (Founder of Virgin), Stephen Hawking (Award-winning physicist), Stephen Fry (Actor and technology columnist), Dr Ian Robertson (Board member at BMW, Gavin Patterson (CEO of BT), Martha Lane Fox (Founder of Lastminute.com), Dido Harding (CEO of TalkTalk), Ronan Dunne (CEO of Telefonica O2 UK), David Stokes (CEO of IBM), and Tim Berners-Lee (inventor of the World Wide Web).\n\nHere\u2019s Richard Branson talking about his fears for Brexit:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1u8iMKml8xI\n\nBill Gates said that a post-Brexit Britain would be a \u201csignificantly less attractive place to do business and invest\u201d. He added:\n\n\u201cWhile ultimately a matter for the British people to decide, it is clear to me that if Britain chooses to be outside of Europe\u2026it will be harder to find and recruit the best talent from across the continent; talent which, in turn, creates jobs for people in the UK.\u201d\n\nAnd Chris Kenyon, the Senior Vice President at Canonical \u2013 the British minds behind the Ubuntu operating system \u2013 said:\n\n\u201cCanonical supports the Remain campaign, and believes the UK will fare better, socially and economically, inside the European Union. Employment conditions, safety standards, scientific advancement and economic vibrancy all improve with access to larger pools of talent and customers.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft founder Bill Gates supports the Remain campaign\n\nKenyon added that the UK has a \u201cspecial deal\u201d with Europe, that is \u201ca better deal than any other country will ever obtain, or that the UK could ever attain again\u201d.\n\nThe technology industry\u2019s Leave camp is a little smaller, granted. Nevertheless, important industry leaders have spoken out in favour of a Brexit vote, including: Sir James Dyson (Founder of Dyson), John Caudwell (Founder of Phones4u), Lord Kalms (Former Chairman of Dixons Retail), and even Julian Assange (Creator of Wikileaks).\n\nHere\u2019s Julian Assange talking about why he believes in Brexit:\n\nSpeaking to the Daily Telegraph, Sir James Dyson said that the UK would \u201ccreate more wealth and more jobs by being outside the EU than we will within it\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhen the Remain campaign tells us no-one will trade with us if we leave the EU, sorry, it\u2019s absolute cobblers. Our trade imbalance with Europe is running at \u00a39 billion a month and rising. If this trend continues, that is \u00a3100 billion a year.\u201d\n\nRelated: EU Roaming Charges\n\nWhat are tech start-ups saying?\n\nSo we\u2019ve heard from big business, but there\u2019s more to the UK economy that giant corporations. What does the UK\u2019s booming tech start-up sector have to say about the prospect of Brexit?\n\nWell, it seems that the vast majority of start-ups are keen to stay in the EU. A recent study by Coadec found that 81% of people in the digital start-up sector are hoping for a Remain vote. The sample size was 175, including 126 start-up founders, 26 start-up employees, 19 investors, and four others.\n\nThe study revealed that the key issues for the Remainers were:\n\nAccess to a large single market, with harmonised regulations\n\nFree movement of labour, giving access to a talented workforce\n\nHaving a \u2018seat at the table\u2019\n\nStability and security\n\nThe key issues for Leavers, meanwhile, were:\n\nSovereignty\n\nOver-regulation and red tape\n\n\u201cThese results aren\u2019t surprising,\u201d explains Coadec in its survey analysis. \u201cThe UK\u2019s start-up community is international in its outlook and in its composition. Founders come to the UK from across Europe (and the world) to launch and grow their businesses. They look to Europe for talented staff to help them grow. And they aim to sell and expand across a trading block of 500 million consumers.\u201d\n\nThe Coadec survey isn\u2019t alone in its findings, either. A survey from Tech London Advocates found 87% of start-ups wanted to remain, while research by techUK found that 71% wanted to remain in a reformed EU.\n\nIn fact, a Brexit vote could be felt very acutely by many of the UK\u2019s tech start-ups. That\u2019s because of the uncertainty over immigration legislation and the possible loss of free movement of labour.\n\nRobert Newry, who founded technology recruitment service Arctic Shores, believes that the current interest in UK start-ups will \u201cdry up\u201d if we leave the EU:\n\n\u201c We currently have 14 employees, four are European, three of whom are first-generation . We need multi-lingual staff and we can\u2019t find all the expertise we need from within the UK. Brexit would cause us not just hiring issues, but contract and revenue ones too.\u201d\n\nToday, Britain\u2019s EU membership guarantees free movement of people. But if we leave, there\u2019s a chance that the UK could place new restrictions on who can enter and leave the UK. However, if the UK negotiates access to the single market post-Brexit, it\u2019s highly likely we\u2019d have to accept free movement of labour as a caveat anyway.\n\nAlex Hemsley, who co-founded Global M, an international technology recruitment start-up based in London, said that being in the EU makes it much easier to hire people in the tech sector:\n\n\u201cThe great thing about being a member of the EU when it comes to hiring is that the search for talent is not constrained by borders or hindered by red tape and therefore startups are free to concentrate on sourcing the best talent quickly and efficiently to support their growth.\u201d\n\nNick Bolton, who created Rota, an app that connects hospitality companies to rated staff, believes that Brexit could \u201ccripple\u201d a number of tech start-ups in the UK.\n\n\u201cOne of the biggest challenges facing tech start-ups is the shortage of good quality developers and many of these highly skilled workers currently come from the EU.\n\nBolton argues that the only thing worse for fundraising than a declining economy is an uncertain one, and that Brexit is likely to cause both: \u201cVenture capitalists will look at more certain, stable economies and avoid pouring money into London.\u201d\n\nInvestment in science research\n\n\n\nTechnology isn\u2019t just about business, though. The UK is one of the largest recipients of research funding in the EU, which has significant impact on science and tech.\n\nAccording to the Royal Society, we receive a greater amount of EU research funding than we contribute. Between 2007 and 2013, we received 8.8 billion euros for research, development, and innovation activities. It\u2019s estimated that we contributed around 5.4 billion euros to Europe\u2019s research coffers in return.\n\nNaturally, scientists welcome this cash, which might explain a Nature poll that revealed 83.46% of researchers oppose Brexit, regardless of whether they intend to vote. A further 4.63% are unsure, and 11.91% want to leave the EU. And even amongst researchers that intend to vote, 80% are against leaving the EU.\n\nProfessor Stephen Hawking called the prospect of Brexit a \u201cdisaster for UK science\u201d in a letter to the Times newspaper, signed by over 150 fellows of the Royal Society. The letter reads:\n\n\u201c First, increased funding has raised greatly the level of European science as a whole and of the UK in particular because we have a competitive edge. Second, we now recruit many of our best researchers from continental Europe, including younger ones who have obtained EU grants and have chosen to move with them here.\u201d\n\nHowever, Professor Angus Dalgleish, of St George\u2019s Hospital at the University of London, who is campaigning for Brexit, argues:\n\n\u201cWe are standing up against what is a very large body of people who feel that if we leave the EU it will be a disaster for funding and collaboration \u2013 and we completely refute that. The bottom line is that we put far more into Europe than we get out. Any difference we can more than easily make up with the money we would save.\u201d\n\nHowever, it\u2019s not actually guaranteed that the government would match the EU\u2019s research spending if we vote for Brexit on Thursday. There\u2019s a real risk that the recouped funds could be used elsewhere, leaving tech research high and dry.\n\nHow would Brexit affect technology for the average person?\n\nIf you\u2019re not spending your days in a Shoreditch caf\u00e9, churning out \u2018game-changer\u2019 apps by the dozen, you have to wonder how the EU\u2019s impact on technology affects the average person.\n\nWell, to answer the age-old question of what has the EU ever done for us, here\u2019s a quick run-down:\n\nScrapping EU roaming charges\n\nLast year, the European Union announced plans to lower the price cap on roaming charges as of April 30, 2016. Better still, roaming charges across Europe will be scrapped entirely from 2017. That means you can\u2019t be charged extra for using your phone texts, minutes, or data when travelling within the European Union.\n\nThat\u2019s an impressive feat, and here\u2019s why. Unlike the USA, Europe\u2019s phone market is hugely complex and fragmented, so getting them to operate on a level playing field is very difficult. It may be fair to say that this simply would never have happened without the existence of the EU.\n\nAnd you care about this, apparently. Research from Broadband Genie recently revealed that 74% of Brits think it\u2019s important for the government to negotiate a deal to eliminate European roaming charges in the event of a Brexit.\n\nEuropean Union has scrapped roaming charges across EU (Coming 2017)\n\nRob Hilborn, Head of Strategy at Broadband Genie, said:\n\n\u201cLike much of the EU debate, it\u2019s hard to cut through the political rhetoric and find hard facts, and that\u2019s no different when it comes to roaming. What is clear is that, regardless of the results on June 23, consumers are demanding the abolishment of EU roaming charges.\u201d\n\nHolding corporations to account\n\nThe European Commission, the executive arm of the EU, is also an excellent body for holding corporations to account.\n\nThe UK, by comparison, has been less successful. Earlier this year, Chancellor George Osborne came under fire after calling the UK\u2019s tax deal with Google a \u201cmajor success\u201d, despite backlash against the \u00a3130 million agreements leniency.\n\nBut the EU has no qualms about putting pressure on Google. Earlier this year, the Commission formally charged Google with unlawfully \u201cpreventing competition\u201d in the mobile (read: Android) and search (read: Google) markets. There\u2019s still some deliberation to go through, but the result could a fine against Google for 10% of its global turnover. Considering its annual revenue in 2015 was $74.5 billion, that\u2019s no small sum.\n\nWithout the EU, it would be much harder for countries to organise collective pressure on multi-national monopolies.\n\nProtecting privacy\n\nThe EU also acts as a buffer against national governments trying to infringe the rights of their citizens. Richard Patterson, the director of security, privacy and comparison website Comparitech, puts it neatly:\n\n\u201cWhile the in-out debates have focused mostly on immigration, spending and so forth, it\u2019s also important that the public gives consideration to their right to privacy. The UK\u2019s proposed Investigatory Powers bill \u2013 or Snooper\u2019s Charter \u2013 would make it easier for the government to snoop on its citizens, but so far the EU courts have been holding the bill back as it is at odds with European Law. Without this protection, the public\u2019s privacy could quite literally be at the stake.\u201d\n\nPatterson added that we could end up in a situation where British citizens have \u201cfar less protections than their EU counterparts\u201d.\n\nSummary\n\nThe UK was split nearly 50/50 on Brexit, but the same certainly isn\u2019t true of the technology sector. It seems that, on balance, Britain\u2019s tech and science industries would have liked us to stay in Europe, and that makes sense. Much of the UK\u2019s technology industry is based in London, a city that has benefited massively from the European Union. But in small towns far detached from the hi-tech capital, it\u2019s likely that the benefits are less conspicuous.\n\nNevertheless, almost everyone gains from research in science and technology, and rulings like the abandonment of EU roaming charges are hard to gloss over. Had the referendum only been open to geeks, a Brexit vote just wouldn\u2019t have happened. Fact.\n\nIt seems that contrary to popular belief, sometimes, computer says yes.\n\nRelated: iPhone 7\n\nThe Refresh: Catch up on the latest tech news\n\nWhat\u2019s your view on Brexit?
