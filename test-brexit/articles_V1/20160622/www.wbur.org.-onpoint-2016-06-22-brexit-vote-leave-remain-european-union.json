(Frank Augstein/AP)\n\nAn epic vote in Britain tomorrow to decide whether the U.K. will stay in the European Union or take the \u201cBrexit.\u201d Passions are running very high. A promising British politician last week murdered by a man shouting \u201cBritain First!\u201d There are real consequences waiting here. For Britain, for Europe. By extension, the United States, the West. This hour On Point, on the eve of Britain\u2019s vote, we talk with Lionel Barber of the Financial Times, Roger Cohen of the New York Times and the Daily Telegraph\u2019s Tim Stanley on \u201cBrexit.\u201d \u2014 Tom Ashbrook\n\nGuests\n\nLionel Barber, editor of the Financial Times. (@lionelbarber)\n\nRoger Cohen, columnist for the New York Times. Author of the book, \"The Girl From Human Street.\" (@NYTimesCohen)\n\nTim Stanley, historian and columnist for the Daily Telegraph. (@timothy_stanley)\n\nFrom Tom\u2019s Reading List\n\nFinancial Times: Young people will be the losers if Britain opts for isolation \u2014 \"If the UK votes for Brexit, there will be \u2014 as with all political experiments \u2014 a variety of unintended consequences. Many of these will fall hardest on the most vulnerable, in particular the young.\"\n\nNew York Times: Jo Cox and Britain\u2019s Place in Europe \u2014 \"The European Union has been through a tough decade. It has been beset by the structural flaws of the euro and a weak response to the financial meltdown of 2008. It has faced the ongoing difficulties of absorbing former Communist bloc nations and the challenge of mass immigration. It needs reinvigoration \u2014 of a kind Britain could lead.\"\n\nDaily Telegraph: Brexit isn't about nostalgia. It's about ambition. Trust me, I'm a historian \u2014 \"There is no historical case for leaving the EU. There is no historical case for staying in. That\u2019s because this isn\u2019t an existential matter. It\u2019s a practical decision. Do you think your country is better off in or out? I think the latter. So I\u2019m voting for Brexit.\"",
