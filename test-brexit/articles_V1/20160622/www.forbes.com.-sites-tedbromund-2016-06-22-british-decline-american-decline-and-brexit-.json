    "text": "James Pethokoukis of the American Enterprise Institute is \u2013 at least to this historian of Britain \u2013 one of the most readable and stimulating commentators on economic affairs out there today. His recent column on \u201cIs America Really in Decline? What We Can Learn from Britain\u201d raises a few points which shed some light on the declinist argument and on the case for Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union, or Brexit.\n\nAs Pethokoukis puts it, drawing on historian Robert Tombs, the so-called decline panic that Britain experienced in the post-1945 decades \u201crests on two assumptions: First, Britain experienced a collapse in global influence and economic dynamism. Second, those results stemmed from \u2018long-standing failures\u2019 of the nation\u2019s core institutions.\u201d\n\nPethokoukis implies this was false. But a good bit of it is actually true. British influence in the world did decline precipitously after 1945, as British withdrawals from the eastern Mediterranean (1947) and East of Suez (1967-68) illustrate. Some of this decline resulted from the rise of the superpowers after 1945, who outmatched the U.K. There was nothing the U.K. could have done about this.\n\nLoss of influence\n\nAnother and much more complicated problem was Britain\u2019s post-war economic weakness, which led directly to most of these withdrawals. In any case, this wasn\u2019t a panic: it felt like a loss of influence for the simple reason that it was a loss of influence.\n\nThen there is Britain\u2019s post-war economic dynamism. Again, it is \u2013 to me \u2013 inarguable that Britain performed worse after 1945 than most of Western Europe. The question is why. It may, as Tombs implies, have been mere post-war catch-up. But it was likely more than that. Britain does seem to have suffered from union-induced overmanning and amateurism in sectors of British corporate management (car manufacturers spring to mind). Worse, after 1945, the U.K. went down the road of nationalization, currency controls and demand management, all of which tended to prioritize stability and vested interests over creative destruction and dynamism.\n\nPethokoukis is completely right, on the other hand, that this led to an assault on \u201cthe nation\u2019s core institutions,\u201d which were taken to be stolid, stuck in the mud, and undynamic. The results can be seen if you look around any British town \u2013 all of which underwent an attack of architectural vandalism of the most Brutalist kind, in the belief that the large scale use of reinforced concerted was, ipso facto, modernizing and would somehow jolt the British psyche from its torpor.\n\nMore broadly, if there was a guiding theme in Britain between the early 1960s and the late 1990s, it was \u201cmodernization.\u201d Of course, that term meant different things to different people \u2013 but by and large it meant more top-down control, relentless legislative fiddling, and, except during the Thatcher/Major era, an expanded state.\n\nThe U.S. is not the UK, but the comparison has its merits\n\nThis isn\u2019t as far from the U.S. experience as Pethokoukis implies. We aren't, fortunately, dwarfed by superpower competitors. On the other hand, there is near-peer China, a range of regional competitors, and we really haven\u2019t won a war for 25 years. We\u2019re not at risk, right now, of a U.K.-style collapse, but we\u2019re on the back heel in Europe and the South China Sea, we\u2019re clearly doing far worse than that in the Middle East, and U.S. defense spending trends look a bit too much like those of the U.K. for comfort.\n\nAnd, on the economic front, while we do look good compared to Europe, that\u2019s cold comfort \u2013 especially when President Obama\u2019s calls for the U.S. to focus on domestic rebuilding (i.e., more domestic spending) have been echoed by current presidential candidates. The U.S. is showing some of the same centralizing trends that did Britain few favors in the post-war era \u2013 trends that, on the progressive side of politics, are accompanied by just the sort of critique of U.S. institutions that the U.K. experienced (find me, for example, a progressive who praises federalism or rejects government-run healthcare). In short, while I agree we\u2019re not the U.K., the comparison has its merits.\n\nThe EU is part centralizing hindrance, part distraction\n\nAnd what of Brexit? One of the major arguments offered for British entry into the European Economic Community (as it then was), was that British industry needed the \u201ccold shower\u201d of greater competition to snap out of its tradition-induced torpor. This was nonsense: British industry (and British unions) had plenty of problems, but the answer wasn\u2019t the EU. It was better government policies. And today, while the U.K. \u2013 thanks in large part to the fact that it\u2019s kept the pound \u2013 still has a fair amount of freedom to make its own policies. EU membership is all about reducing that freedom. The EU today is partly a centralizing hindrance and partly, as it was in the 1960s, a distraction from focusing on substantive issues.\n\nAnd besides, if anyone today needs a cold shower, as Pethokoukis\u2019s graphs imply, it\u2019s the continent. Britain and the U.S. could and should be doing better, but it\u2019s the EU that\u2019s really underperforming. Focusing on the EU as your best market is a bit like emphasizing selling into the British Empire in 1945: It\u2019s a declining, fissiparous market that still has imperial ambitions.\n\nBritain suffered after World War II, in part, because it had had the Empire as a more or less captive market for too long. If what you want is more dynamism in your economy \u2013 and that\u2019s the ultimate answer to concerns about decline \u2013 the last thing you need, politically or economically, is more EU.",
