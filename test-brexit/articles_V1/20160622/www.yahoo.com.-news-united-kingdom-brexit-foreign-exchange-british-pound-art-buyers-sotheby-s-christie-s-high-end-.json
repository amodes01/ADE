    "text": "The United Kingdom votes this week on whether to stay in the European Union, and equity and forex investors are worried about the effect of a so-called Brexit (British Exit) on the markets.\n\n\n\nBut the Brexit could have could have legitimate implications for a more niche interest group: art collectors.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn periods of market uncertainty, we tend to see collectors seek out well known blue chip names over younger, more emerging artists, as these are seen to be stronger investments and less risky,\u201d says Jacqueline Towers-Perkins, a specialist in post-war and contemporary art at artnet auctions. \u201cSo that could be something to bear in mind with these potential changes happening.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn other words, the market uncertainty stemming from a possible Brexit could influence high-end art connoisseurs to stick with established folks rather than experiment on up-and-coming artists.\n\n\n\nThe EU referendum vote on Thursday happens to fall between Sotheby\u2019s (BID) major impressionist and modern art sale, which was Tuesday, and its contemporary sale on June 28. Christie\u2019s major sales will be held on Friday and June 29.\n\n\n\nTowers-Perkins hasn\u2019t seen any change in bidder interest on her site, though. \u201cPeople are still buying and selling in the same way and still looking for the pieces that they\u2019re searching for in the same way that they\u2019ve always had,\u201d she says.\n\n\n\nStill, in a note to clients, Consumer Edge Research\u2019s Dave Schick cautioned that \u201cpolitical concerns are global in nature\u201d and the Brexit vote will \u201clikely [have] some impact on consignment wins for major auction houses.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut it\u2019s not clear whether a Britain\u2019s potential exit from the EU would encourage people to buy or sell art. According to a Bloomberg survey of economists, the British pound will move one way or another depending on how the vote goes. The economists found the currency will either sink to the lowest level in more than 30 years if the \u201cleave\u201d camp wins or potentially climb 6% to its highest level so far this year if the \u201cremain\u201d camp prevails.\n\n\n\nAnd this week in an opinion piece in The Guardian George Soros sounded the alarm that the pound will plummet if Britain leaves the EU.\n\n\n\nSchick says the volatility in currency markets would leave \u201ccollectors in the UK largely unaffected\u201d but would make an impact on foreign bidders, who would be able to use the pound\u2019s potential weakness in their favor.\n\n\n\nUltimately, though, high-end art collectors may be more influenced by their own tastes than outside market forces.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere might be some fluctuations in the market but I think ultimately if collectors continue to buy what they love and continue to hold onto the pieces that they\u2019ve loved, I think the market isn\u2019t going to affect people\u2019s collection and buying and selling habits too much,\u201d says Towers-Perkins.\n\n\n\nRead more about the Brexit:\n\nWhat is a 'Brexit'?\n\nHere\u2019s what the Brexit vote could mean for the US stock market\n\nNAFTA architect articulates the global story at the core of the Brexit vote\n\nHarry Potter author JK Rowling uses Voldemort as a metaphor for Brexit\n\n\n\n\n\nView Comments",
