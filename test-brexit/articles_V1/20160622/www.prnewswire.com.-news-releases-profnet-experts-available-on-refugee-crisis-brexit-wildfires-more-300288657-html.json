Since 2003, Iraqi and Syrian Christians have experienced multiple displacement. They live in terrible conditions, their children are not being educated, and they are dying of simple diseases due to lack of medicine.\"\n\nTaimoorazy is a former refugee and human rights advocate who is well versed in the refugee crisis and U.S. policy in the Middle East. She is able to address human rights, religious freedom and nation building. She has a master's degree from Northeastern Illinois University; was granted the prestigious Philos Project fellowship in 2015; and is a sought-after speaker and expert with media appearances/interviews that include Varney and Company, WSJ TV, New York Post, and \"The Sean Hannity Show.\" Based in Chicago, Taimoorazy travels extensively and is frequently in Washington, D.C., and New York. She is fluent in Italian, Farsi and Assyrian.\n\nWebsite: http://iraqichristianrelief.org\n\nContact: Karen Swim, [email protected]\n\nThe Truth Behind Brexit\n\nJonathan Citrin\n\nFinancial Advisor\n\nAmeriprise Financial\n\n\"Brexit is grabbing global headlines due to the very nature of the decision. But let's be clear, this is not a vote on economics or even finance. This referendum is about something even bigger and everyone \u2013 from voters to investors to policy-makers \u2013 are wise to know the truth.\"\n\nExamining the issue from a behavioral perspective, Citrin can share his thoughts on what Britain's landmark referendum says about voter and investor psychology and what Brexit could mean to financial markets. He is a prominent commentator in the media, for outlets such MarketWatch and CNBC, and has been a contributor to numerous publications, including Investopedia and the Wall Street Journal. He was recently quoted in an article on Brexit for U.S. News & World Report: http://tinyurl.com/h9pk23n\n\nProfNet Profile: http://www.profnetconnect.com/jonathancitrin\n\nWebsite: http://www.JonathanCitrin.com\n\nContact: William Citrin, [email protected]\n\nActor's Death Shows Lack of Auto Industry Urgency\n\nWes Ball\n\nAutomotive Defect Attorney\n\nFarrar & Ball, Houston\n\nDisturbing new details are emerging in the tragic death of actor Anton Yelchin, who was killed when his Chrysler Jeep Cherokee unexpectedly rolled down his inclined driveway, pinning him against a brick pillar. Yelchin's 2015 Grand Cherokee SUV is one of the models recently recalled by federal regulators for a gear shift lever that can slip out of gear and was designed to operate in a way that regulators say could be confusing. Automakers need to show more urgency when dangerous defects become apparent. Says Ball: \"What we see over and over again in these situations is that automakers are aware of product defects, but they alert consumers only after injuries mount and regulators finally step in to force a recall. Once recalls are issued, these global corporations show a shameful lack of urgency in making sure vehicle owners are aware of the dangers. While investigators are calling this a 'tragic accident,' it's clear that Jeep should be doing a much better job warning motorists of the potential problems that could cause their vehicles to roll away like this.\"\n\nContact: Robert Tharp, [email protected]\n\nDrought-Related Fire Hazard and Environment Impact/Issues\n\nTimothy Krantz\n\nProfessor, Environmental Studies\n\nUniversity of Redlands\n\n\"One has a situation where the past decade of average or below-average precipitation has resulted in a cumulative fire risk. In our mountains, poor forest lands management in our urban forest communities, such as Big Bear, Running Springs and Lake Arrowhead (building foundations within drip lines or right up to the trunks, trees growing through decks, paving over treed areas, etc.), has weakened trees and caused an exacerbation of bark beetle populations even in average rainfall years. The trees' natural means of expelling bark beetles is to pump sap, literally blocking the beetles in their bore holes. With the drought, the trees can't produce enough sap and the bark beetle populations have exploded from the urban forest areas out into the natural forestlands, devastating some areas with high numbers of tree mortalities. These standing dead trees are like match sticks, waiting for a spark or lightning strike.\"\n\nWebsite: http://www.redlands.edu\n\nContact: Jennifer Dobbs, [email protected]\n\nCauses of Wildfires and Environmental Impacts of Drought\n\nWendy McIntyre\n\nProfessor, Environmental Studies\n\nUniversity of Redlands\n\n\"The drought is the most important reason that fire season is growing each year. Weather does play a role, especially when rain or snow changes the susceptibility of ecosystems to fire, and how the rain or snow falls -- i.e., do we get rains in huge downpours (which mostly runs off) or in slower steady showers that can soak into the ground and be available to plants to keep them growing and less fire-prone.\"\n\nWebsite: http://www.redlands.edu\n\nContact: Jennifer Dobbs, [email protected]\n\nDeaf-Blind Awareness Week Begins June 26\n\nBeth Kennedy\n\nDirector of DeafBlind Central\n\nCentral Michigan University\n\n\"Deafblindness is a disability of access. An intervener works one-on-one with a child who is deafblind to provide access and support. They foster growth within the student, assist them in making social connections and help them access the curriculum. They are a bridge between the student and teacher.\"\n\nKennedy developed CMU's new online Deafblind Intervener Certificate Program. She is available to discuss deafblindness, working with deafblind children and the training of deafblind interveners -- professionals who improve educational outcomes for those who are deafblind. She is an expert in working with deafblind children, helping to provide access, foster communication growth and help the student reach their potential. CMU offers only one of only two deafblind intervener programs in the nation.\n\nWebsite: http://cmich.edu/news\n\nContact: Rachel Esterline Perkins, [email protected]\n\nMEDIA JOBS:\n\nFollowing are links to job listings for staff and freelance writers, editors and producers.

They're the heart of a newsroom and where almost every story begins. They find the stories by fielding calls from the public, listening to scanners, reading news releases (yes, it still happens), planning the stories and assigning them to a reporter. They're producers and troubleshooters and also make the suggestions as to whether or not a story should be covered.
