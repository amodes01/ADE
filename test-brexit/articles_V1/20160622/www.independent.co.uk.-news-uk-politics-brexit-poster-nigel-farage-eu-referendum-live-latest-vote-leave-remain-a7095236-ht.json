The poster Mr Farage unveiled showed refugees on the Slovenian border - part of Europe's passport-free Schengen area.\n\nNext to the billboard was the headline \u201cBreaking Point\u201d and underneath it \u201cthe EU has failed us all\u201d.\n\nWhen asked if he had apologised for the controversial billboard \u2013 as one Ukip MEP claimed during the television BBC debate on Tuesday \u2013 Mr Farage responded after his speech: \u201cI apologised for the timing\u2026 but I can\u2019t apologise for the truth.\u201d\n\nThe SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon described the poster as \u201cdisgusting\u201d while one of her MPs, Pete Wishard, also weighed in saying that a \u201cvote for leave is pretty much become a vote for petty xenophobia and anti-immigrant rhetoric\u201d. American playwright Bonnie Greer, who has famously clashed with Mr Farage in the past, compared him to Nazi military leader Herman Goering.\n\nGeorge Osborne, the Chancellor, described it \u201cdisgusting and vile\u201d and said it had \u201cechoes of literature used in the 1930s\u201d.\n\nMr Farage also used his last major speech before voters head to the polls to cast their vote in the EU referendum to urge British people to vote with the \u201cheart\u201d and \u201csoul\u201d. He added that voters could make Friday the UK\u2019s \"Independence Day\u201d.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s stop pretending what this European project is,\u201d the Ukip leader said in his speech. \u201cThey have an anthem, they are building an army, they\u2019ve already got their own police force and of course they\u2019ve got a flag.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day tomorrow when people vote they must make a decision: which flag is theirs? I want, I want us to live under British passports and under the British flag.\u201d\n\n\u201cVote with your heart, vote with your soul, vote with pride in this country and its people and together we can make tomorrow our Independence Day \u2013 a big day in our national history.\n\nSpeaking to press from all over the world and Vote Leave supporters in Westminster, Mr Farage branded the EU \"a big business cartel\".\n\nHe said: \"We find ourselves, for the benefit of tariff-free trade, having to accept unlimited free movement of people. We find ourselves prohibited from making our own deals with the rest of the world.\"\n\nMr Farage accused Brussels of usurping control and sovereignty from the UK, and imposing EU law which \"is supreme\". His voice rising with passion and pulling out his passport from his jacket and waving it in front of the microphone - a signature move by the Ukip leader - he declared: \"We don't even have a British passport anymore\" - raising a clap from his supporters in the audience.\n\nHe said: \"Let's stop pretending what this European project is - they have an anthem, they are building an army, they have already got their own police force, and of course they have got a flag. \"At the end of the day tomorrow when people vote they have to make a decision - which flag is theirs? \"I want us to live under British passports and under the British flag.\"\n\nThe EU referendum debate has so far been characterised by bias, distortion and exaggeration. So until 23 June we we\u2019re running a series of question and answer features that explain the most important issues in a detailed, dispassionate way to help inform your decision.\n\nWhat is Brexit and why are we having an EU referendum?\n\nDoes the UK need to take more control of its sovereignty?\n\nCould the UK media swing the EU referendum one way or another?\n\nWill the UK benefit from being released from EU laws?\n\nWill we gain or lose rights by leaving the European Union?\n\nWill Brexit mean that Europeans have to leave the UK?\n\nWill leaving the EU lead to the break-up of the UK?\n\nWhat will happen to immigration if there's Brexit?\n\nWill Brexit make the UK more or less safe?\n\nWill the UK benefit from being released from EU laws?\n\nWill leaving the EU save taxpayers money and mean more money for the NHS?\n\nWhat will Brexit mean for British tourists booking holidays in the EU?\n\nWill Brexit help or damage the environment?\n\nWill Brexit mean that Europeans have to leave the UK?\n\nWhat will Brexit mean for British expats in Europe?",
