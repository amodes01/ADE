He wants it.\n\nAsian automakers and Indian conglomerates are against it.\n\nA vote in favor of exiting the EU (currently too close to call) could end Game of Thrones.\n\nGood BBC cheat-sheet here.\n\nCENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC: In 2013, the West stood back and watched as French-speaking Central African Republic\u2014which is 76 percent mostly Protestant Christian\u2014fell to a well-armed and heavily funded alliance of Arabic-speaking jihadists. Now the country is awash in competing militias, with Christians caught in the crossfire: More than 250 have been abducted in the first three months of this year.\n\nIRAQ: Fighting Islamic State in Fallujah is not a zero-sum game, as this article suggests. But Iraq\u2019s divided Sunnis will have to be brought alongside the fight in order for the country to have a future.\n\nThe American aid group Preemptive Love Coalition continues to bring aid to the estimated 90,000 Fallujah residents in dire need\u2014100,000 pounds of aid delivered over the weekend, I\u2019ve been told.\n\nEGYPT: The Jesus Fragment (or \u201cThe Gospel of Jesus\u2019 Wife\u201d) is a fake\u2014in case you were wondering. The Harvard scholar who \u201cdiscovered\u201d it now admits as much.",
