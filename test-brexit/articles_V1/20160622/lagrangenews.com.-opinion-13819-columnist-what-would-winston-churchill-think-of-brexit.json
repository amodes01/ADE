    "text": "Columnist: What would Winston Churchill think of Brexit? Published 12:00 am Wednesday, June 22, 2016\n\n\u201cI wish to speak to you today about the tragedy of Europe,\u201d Winston Churchill told his audience in 1946. But he wasn\u2019t speaking of a united Europe as a bad thing. Actually, he strongly supported the development of a European Union, and probably wouldn\u2019t embrace \u201cBrexit,\u201d the decision of the United Kingdom to leave the EU, which will soon be in the hands of voters.\n\n\u201cLet Europe Arise!\u201d former Prime Minister Churchill stated at a speech to the University of Zurich, which you can find in \u201cVital Speeches of the Day\u201d published on Oct. 1, 1946 (you can also find it in the book The Sinews of Peace, under \u201cPost-War Speeches by Winston S. Churchill, published by Cassell & Company, Ltd. in 1948).\n\n\u201cIf Europe is to be saved from infinite misery and, indeed, from final doom, there must be this act of faith in the European family and this act of oblivion against all the crimes and follies of the past, and the free peoples of Europe must rise to the height of these resolves of the soul and of the instinct of the spirit of man,\u201d Churchill said.\n\nAnd he wasn\u2019t some \u201cBritain First\u201d character like the assassin of British MP Jo Cox, where everything is about national sovereignty.\n\n\u201cThe structure of the United States of Europe, if well and truly built, will be such as to make the material strength of a single state less important,\u201d Churchill stated. \u201cSmall nations will count as much as large ones and gain their honor by their contribution to the common cause.\u201d\n\nOf course he didn\u2019t like some of the specific plans of his day, namely the Treaty of Paris as well as the European Defense Community. But when he got back into office after his party lost parliament in 1945, he pushed hard for the West European Union.\n\n\u201cIf we are to form a United States of Europe, or whatever name it may take, we must begin now. \u2026 Our constant aim must be to build and fortify the strength of the United Nations organization. Under and within that world concept, we must recreate the European family in a regional structure, called, it may be, the United States of Europe, and the first practical step would be to form a Council of Europe. If at first all states of Europe are not willing or able to join the union, we must nevertheless proceed to assemble and combine those who will and can.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m sure there are some who would say that things are different now than in Churchill\u2019s time, with Middle East refugees. But the great British Prime Minister knew that xenophobia and hatred of others was what led to the need for a stronger Europe to combat these in the first place.\n\n\u201cIt is from Europe that has sprung that series of frightful and nationalistic morals originated by the Teutonic nations in their rise to power, which we have seen in the 20th century and which have for a long time wrecked the peace and marred the prospects of all mankind,\u201d Churchill told the people.\n\nHe also credited \u201cthat great republic across the Atlantic Ocean has at length realized that the ruin or enslavement of Europe has involved their own fate as well.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s right \u2014 Churchill wanted the United States to play a strong role in helping foster a unified Europe. We need to study what Churchill said, beyond the Iron Curtain speech and catty comments to Lady Astor.\n\nIf we\u2019re so angry over a bust of him being allegedly removed from the White House \u2014 fact check it \u2014 we should listen to his words about what should be done in Europe.\n\nhttp://lagrangenews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/37/2016/06/web1_WEBTuresJohn2014RGB-4.jpg\n\nBy John A.
