    "text": "With less than two days till the referendum, campaigners did their utmost to project their messages in the BBC debate\n\nLess than 48 hours before the U.K. decides the E.U.\u2019s fate at the polls on June 23, Remain and Leave campaigners aggressively battled to project their core messages in the last and largest debate of the the two-month campaign at London\u2019s Wembley Arena on Tuesday.\n\nIn front of a crowd of 6,000, three Remain debaters \u2014 London Mayor Sadiq Khan, Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson, and General Secretary of the Trades Union Congress Frances O\u2019Grady \u2014 faced off against Vote Leave\u2019s Boris Johnson, Minister of State for Energy Andrea Leadsom, and Labour MP Gisela Stuart. The televised debate was moderated by the BBC\u2019s David Dimbleby.\n\nThe referendum campaign has been marked by a new civility following the assassination of MP Jo Cox last week, but you might not have guessed it from the tenor of the debate. The Remain side wasted no time in attacking the allegedly misleading campaign materials and claims of their opponents. Khan held up a Vote Leave leaflet that suggested Iraq and Syria would soon share the same border with the E.U. Addressing his predecessor Boris Johnson, he said: \u201cYour campaign hasn\u2019t been Project Fear, it\u2019s been Project Hate as far as immigration is concerned.\u201d\n\nRead more: Brexit: Should They Stay or Should They Go?\n\nWhen Johnson called the E.U. a \u201cjob destroying engine,\u201d Davidson launched a strong attack against her fellow Conservative Party member \u2013 and potential leadership rival \u2014 saying: \u201cYou\u2019re going to be asked to vote in two days time and all you\u2019ve heard tonight is \u2018trust us and it will all be fine\u2019 and that\u2019s not good enough\u201d she said. \u201cThey [Vote Leave] won\u2019t tell us how much the economy will be hit by, they won\u2019t tell us how many jobs might go, they won\u2019t tell us what they will replace the single market with.\u201d\n\nWhile audience members TIME spoke to said they were most excited to see Khan and Johnson in action, it was Scotland\u2019s Davidson who stole some of the limelight. She won applause by angrily lambasting the opposite side\u2019s call to \u201ctake back control\u201d of the the country\u2019s borders, by withdrawing from free movement rules that have seen up to 3 million Europeans settle in the U.K. \u201cYou lose control by losing your seat at the table,\u201d Davidson responded.\n\nBut the blonde-haired former mayor wrapped-up the event on a high. In rousing ending remarks, Johnson declared that Vote Leave was the side of \u201chope\u201d and June 23 could become Britain\u2019s \u201cIndependence Day.\u201d Speaking after the debate, Remain audience member Jason Tay, 23, conceded that Vote Leave had received the audience\u2019s most enthusiastic response, which he credits to Johnson\u2019s \u201cnatural charm.\u201d \u201cI personally believe Remain had more substance\u201d said Tay. \u201cBut, it was Boris\u2019s speech that got a standing ovation.\u201d\n\nNaturally, both campaigns claimed a win. \u201cThe in campaign had nothing positive to contribute tonight\u201d Vote Leave spokesperson Matthew Elliott told reporters afterwards. \u201cJust like they have failed to make a positive contribution to the whole campaign.\u201d Director of Britain Stronger In Will Straw said the leave campaign \u201cblew their last chance\u201d to give a credible plan for Britain\u2019s future.\n\nRead more: A Brief History of Britain\u2019s Tortured Relationship With the European Union in 11 Quotes\n\nPro-Remain Labour MP Chuka Umunna told TIME after the event that a vote to leave would be devastating for Britain\u2019s relationship to the wider world as it acts \u201cas an important bridge\u201d to countries like the U.S. and India. \u201cPresident Obama has been very clear that Britain amplifies its influence by being a member of the European Union,\u201d Umunna said. \u201cIf we leave the European Union we won\u2019t be that.\u201d\n\nEuroskeptic MP Priti Patel thinks the opposite is true, citing the common Vote Leave platform that bilateral relations with countries beyond the E.U. would improve if there is a vote to leave. \u201cQuite frankly the reality is when we vote to leave we would have the freedom to grow our relationships\u201d she told TIME.\n\nAs spirited as both sides\u2019 arguments may be, according to an average of six recent polls the referendum could go either way with Remain currently holding a small 2 point lead. And besides, few in this crowd were open to having their minds changed. The political affiliations of the audience were on display: a group of attendees could be heard chiming \u2018Vote Remain\u2019 instead of \u2018cheese\u2019 when having their photo taken. A Vote Leave supporter wore what looked to be a bespoke, bright red suit with the campaign group\u2019s logo stitched to the back, while Antonio Vitiello from Bedfordshire, a \u201ccard carrying member\u201d of the U.K. Independence Party, sang the anti-E.U. parody song Britain\u2019s Coming Home.\n\n\u201cMost are here to reinforce their ideals,\u201d said Euroskeptic pilot Peter Griffiths, 67. \u201c[Tonight] won\u2019t change my mind.\u201d",
