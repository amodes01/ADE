    "text": "Britain will soon decide whether to remain in the European Union, with a process known as Brexit, and the leader of a state nationalist movement hopes Texas will one day have its own Texit vote.\n\nDaniel Miller hopes the secessionist Brexit movement will motivate citizens of Texas to call for their own Texit referendum to peacefully leave the union and establish their own independent country, reports the Guardian.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of people asking, if Brexit why not Texit?\u201d\n\nMiller points to the failed Scottish Independence vote in 2014 and the upcoming Brexit vote this week to say the secessionist movement is sweeping the Western world, according to the Guardian.\n\n\u201c[This] only helps our case because there is a concrete first world example of a modern democracy having a legitimate and public debate where the people of a country, not the political class, get to vote on how they govern themselves and that will resonate not just through Europe but here as well.\u201d\n\nThe Brexit secessionist movement is fueled by the idea of independent determination with the knowledge people don\u2019t like to be governed by institutions that are far away and culturally different from their own.\n\nThe #Brexit vote is in less than 48 hours. ?? Could \"Texit\" be next? https://t.co/v1xJrzN1mh \u2014 Frank Luntz (@FrankLuntz) June 21, 2016\n\nBritons in the Leave camp complain about the UK\u2019s loss of status, the millions spent on the EU government and open borders that allow free movement within the EU. Those in the Remain camp, however, argue the open borders help improve trade, create jobs, and that leaving the EU would devastate Britain\u2019s economy.\n\nBack in Texas, Miller argues the secessionist emotions boiling over in Britain and the desire to be free from the intervention of faraway governments is the same felt by Texans across the Lone Star State, reports the Guardian.\n\n\u201cYou could take \u2018Britain\u2019 out and replace it with \u2018Texas\u2019. You could take \u2018EU\u2019 out and replace it with \u2018US\u2019. You could take \u2018Brussels\u2019 out and replace it with \u2018Washington DC.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s not alone in his desire to see a free and independent Texas, but the Texit movement to withdraw from the union hasn\u2019t been widely popular recently \u2014 it didn\u2019t make it to the ballot or onto the Republican platform.\n\nA group called the Republic of Texas believes the Lone Star State never surrendered its sovereignty to the United States when it became a state in 1845; they argue the U.S. illegally annexed the country, according to their website.\n\n\u201cThe great deception can be undone, stay tuned\u2026\u201d\n\nCan't wait for the #Texit Republic secession referendum. Backtested to 1836, market generally goes up long run. pic.twitter.com/EvycoHz9Xz \u2014 Barbarian Capital (@BarbarianCap) June 22, 2016\n\nThey claim to run a parallel government complete with identity cards and printed money that is trying to secede from the union via a Texit referendum, just like those in Britain who want to leave the European Union in a Brexit vote.\n\nMiller claims the Texas secessionist movement has 260,000 supporters and, in fact, soon after Barack Obama was re-elected as president, a Texit petition garnered more than 125,000 signatures.\n\nThe White House\u2019s response was simple: No.\n\nThe last leader of the modern-day Texas secession movement, Lance McLaren, was arrested after a standoff with federal authorities and is currently serving a 99-year jail term with a 2090 release date.\n\n#Texit: #Brexit American Style \u2013 Why Texas Wants Independence From the United States https://t.co/LTrZtLePDu \u2014 Canary Trap (@canarytrap) June 22, 2016\n\nMeanwhile, the Texas National Movement, TNM, is calling for a Texit secession through a referendum, just like the British have done in the UK. A petition drive last year asking for a non-binding vote on the secession failed to gather enough signatures, but the issue was brought up at the Texas Republican Convention.\n\nThe Texit idea never made it to the floor for a vote, but just the fact that it was brought up means the idea is becoming more mainstream.\n\nShould Texans be allowed a Texit vote to decide whether to stay in the union?\n\n[Photo by Brian Bahr/Getty Images]",
