The incident occurred on a Juneyao Airlines flight from Guiyang to Shanghai on August 24. The child, who was traveling with her grandparents, reportedly cried non-stop during the nearly three-hour flight. In an attempt to &quot;educate her,&quot; two female passengers took the child to the restroom with the grandmother's consent. The video of the incident was posted on Douyin, China's version of TikTok, by one of the women involved.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the video, one woman can be heard telling the crying child, &quot;We won't let you out unless you stop crying.&quot; Once the child stopped crying, the woman filming the video picked her up and warned her, &quot;If you make any noise again, we'll come back (to the bathroom).&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>The video quickly went viral, with many social media users accusing the women of being heartless and bullying the child.

After eighteen years of dedicated service, Deanna West-Torrence will step down from her role as CEO and assume the title of Founder. Deanna has been a driving force behind NECIC since its inception in 2006 and her legacy in the North End community is profound. A longtime resident and community leader, she has dedicated her life to improving the quality of life and economic landscape of the North End.\u003cbr />\u003cbr />Her journey with NECIC began with a vision of a resident driven plan to address the numerous challenges faced by the neighborhood. Having served on Mansfield City Council as the Fifth Ward council representative, she recognized that there was no comprehensive plan that addressed the issues residents wanted solved. As early as 2005, following her council service, Deanna was hired under former Mayor Lydia Reid, to be the Director of the city’s Department of Regional Community Advancement (formerly the Neighborhood Youth Corps). It was then that she began conversations with the then Fran and Warren Rupp Foundation and they suggested convening a group of residents and community leaders to address the challenges faced by the neighborhood. Under her leadership, NECIC has become a cornerstone of community development, empowering residents and fostering sustainable growth. The Community Economic Development plan was the first of its kind, laying the groundwork for future community planning efforts such as Mansfield Rising that also encompassed parts of the North End. Under Deanna’s leadership, the organization has delivered three iterations of the Community Economic Development Plan and has accomplished many of the goals of the program through its programming that has grown to include the African American Leadership Initiative, neighborhood small grants, blight elimination projects, elder and youth programming, civic engagement programs, housing related services, small and minority business development, an alternative staffing agency, community garden grants program, a teaching garden, and urban farming. All of these efforts were part of fulfilling the residents’ wishes and building on the assets available. Most recently, the organization launched an effort to build a Community Impact Center which is a long-term goal that will provide healthcare, mental health arts, education, recreation, and office space to several partner agencies who have come together to impact the community, even beyond the neighborhood.\u003cbr />\u003cbr />Deanna recently relocated to San Diego to be with her family, including her daughter, son-in-law, and grandson. Although she is stepping back from her role as CEO, she will continue to provide her invaluable wisdom and guidance to NECIC as its Founder. In this role Deanna will focus on strategic mentorship of the incoming CEO, program development and innovation, managing special projects, and supporting grant writing and fund development efforts. This role allows Deanna to leverage her deep institutional knowledge and community connections to ensure NECIC's ongoing growth and success while empowering the new CEO to lead independently.\u003cbr />\u003cbr />We are also pleased to announce that Tony Chinni, our current Research and Development Manager and the longest-serving staff member at NECIC, will be stepping into the role of Interim CEO. Tony joined NECIC in 2007 as its first intern, even before the doors were officially open. He has played a critical role in helping Deanna establish the organization and has been at the forefront of our community development planning efforts ever since. Tony has served as the CommunityDevelopment Manager, Housing Coordinator, and most recently its Research and Development Manager.\u003cbr />\u003cbr />Born and raised in Mansfield, Tony graduated from Mansfield Senior High in 1994 and later earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in European History from The Ohio State University in 2007. Throughout his time at NECIC, Tony has been the primary author of the North End’s Community Economic Development Plans, the key documents that have guided our work in the community. He is currently leading the latest update to this plan, ensuring that our efforts continue to reflect the needs and aspirations of North End residents.\u003cbr />\u003cbr />“As I step into this role, I am deeply honored and humbled to continue the incredible work that Deanna and I dedicated ourselves to over the past seventeen years,” Tony Chinni stated. “Deanna has not only been a mentor but also a dear friend, whose leadership and vision have profoundly shaped this organization, this community, and me personally.

Smith | The Glenn Beck Podcast ","duration":5410,"isExplicit":false,"description":"Do you know why a cowboy takes his hat off before dinner? Forrie J. Smith from \"Yellowstone\" says it’s all part of the “cowboy culture.” In this episode of \"The Glenn Beck Podcast,\" Forrie recounts his career — from cowboy to stuntman to beloved actor — and that one time he had to track down “illegals” wreaking havoc on his ranch at the U.S.-Mexico border. He and Glenn discuss the decline in American beef, how social media has created political silos, and the transgender agenda being pushed on America’s youth in public schools. “When you start messing with my children ... with my animals, you crossed a line,” Forrie says, which is why he isn’t afraid to ask the questions that make most actors' knees buckle. Will the 2024 election be secure? What will be done with all the fentanyl flowing across our open border? Forrie isn’t worried about what the rich and powerful think. As he says, they’ll come looking for him when disaster strikes because he can “survive with a knife.” With all his success, he’s most proud that everywhere he’s lived he’s been called a “good neighbor,” even by that one neighbor with “different politics,” who wants to relocate the rattlesnakes in the front yard when Forrie would rather just shoot them. \nForrie is an ambassador for the Special Operations Warrior Foundation: https://specialops.org/ \n \nSponsors \n\nRelief Factor \nRelief Factor can help you live pain-free!

The incident occurred on a Juneyao Airlines flight from Guiyang to Shanghai on August 24. The child, who was traveling with her grandparents, reportedly cried non-stop during the nearly three-hour flight. In an attempt to &quot;educate her,&quot; two female passengers took the child to the restroom with the grandmother's consent. The video of the incident was posted on Douyin, China's version of TikTok, by one of the women involved.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the video, one woman can be heard telling the crying child, &quot;We won't let you out unless you stop crying.&quot; Once the child stopped crying, the woman filming the video picked her up and warned her, &quot;If you make any noise again, we'll come back (to the bathroom).&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>The video quickly went viral, with many social media users accusing the women of being heartless and bullying the child.
