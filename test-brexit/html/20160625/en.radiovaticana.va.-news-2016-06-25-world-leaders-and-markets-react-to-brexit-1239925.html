            With the British pound declining and shares plunging in Europe, the United States
            and other markets, government leaders wonder who else may leave the European Union
            after Britain. If it's up to populist leaders, Brexit is the beginning of the unraveling of
            the EU.</p>
            
            <p>Dutch firebrand politician Geert Wilders who leads the anti-Islam PVV party told
            Vatican Radio that he wants a similar 'Nexit' vote in the Netherlands. "It's a historic
            day. The people of Britain have been teaching the elite in London and Brussels a lesson,"
            he said.</p>
            
            <p>"They choose for an independent Britain that can take care of its own affairs,
            its own borders its own migration policy and money. And I hope and think that the
            Netherlands should do the same."</p>
            
            <p>His comments worry governments in Eastern Europe as his party is leading in opinion
            polls in the Netherlands ahead of upcoming elections. Hungary, Czech Republic, Poland
            and Slovakia, known as the Visegrad Group view Brexit as a major loss for the EU.</p>
            
            <p><strong>EU subsidies</strong></p>
            
            <p>They are heavily dependent on billions of euros in EU subsidies and fear for the
            future of the many East Europeans working in Britain. Slovakia, which take over the
            EU's rotating presidency on July 1, has already urged Britain to say when it will
            leave in an effort to end the uncertainty.</p>
            
            <p>Poland, the largest economy among East Europe's EU member states, is worried too.
            Poland's Foreign Minister Witold Waszczkowski said Brexit would lead to "problems,
            problems for both Great Britain and for Poland. Problems, troubles, chaos, long chronic
            negotiations."</p>
            
            <p>In Western Europe, French President Francois Hollande warned: "The danger of extremism
            and populism is immense. It's always quicker to undo than to create. To destroy than to
            build. France, founding member of the EU, won't accept it."</p>
            
            <p>The United States also expressed concern. And shock waves are felt in Brussels
            where the president of the European Council, Donald Tusk, tried to calm down his worried
            colleagues. "I always remember what my father used to tell me: 'what doesn't kill
            you, makes you stronger'."</p>
            
            <p>Yet for now the uncertainty continues over the future of the EU, once founded after
            World War Two to avoid new conflicts in Europe.</p>
            
            <p>It also comes amid mounting East-West tensions over Russia's annexation of Ukraine's
            Crimean Peninsula and its alleged support for pro-Russian separatists. However Russian
            President Vladimir Putin denied allegations that he had influenced the vote in Britain
            to leave the EU.</p>
