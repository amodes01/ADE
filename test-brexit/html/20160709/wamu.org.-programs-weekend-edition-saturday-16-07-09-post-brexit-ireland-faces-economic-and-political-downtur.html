Here\u2019s Why","content":"<p>The European Union and the United Kingdom reached a new Brexit agreement on Thursday, and while it appeared to mark a big breakthrough in the years-long process, the saga doesn&#8217;t end here.<\/p>\n<p>The withdrawal deal still needs approval in both the U.K. and European parliaments. Although EU leaders unanimously endorsed it in Brussels on Thursday, it faces stiff opposition in Britain&#8217;s Parliament, which has voted down three previous Brexit deals.<\/p>\n<p>The U.K. is scheduled to leave the EU on Oct. 31.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some of the sticking points in the latest withdrawal deal and what could happen next.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What are some details of the agreement?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>After Britain leaves the EU, Northern Ireland would still legally be inside the U.K.&#8217;s customs area, but it would begin collecting duties for the EU on products arriving from Great Britain that could eventually be destined for Ireland. That arrangement prevents the need for a customs border between the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland. But it effectively creates one in the Irish Sea, which opponents of the deal say amounts to a separation of Northern Ireland from the rest of the U.K.<\/p>\n<p>The Northern Ireland Assembly \u2014 which hasn&#8217;t met in more than two years \u2014 would vote every four years on whether to continue this arrangement.<\/p>\n<p><strong>So is Brexit a done deal? <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>No, the deal has to be ratified by the British Parliament on Saturday. The opposition Labour Party, the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National Party are expected to reject it. Prime Minister Boris Johnson can count on the support of his Conservative Party, but it doesn&#8217;t have a majority in Parliament. It has relied on the 10 votes of the Democratic Unionist Party of Northern Ireland. That group is opposed to the new Brexit deal. &#8220;The proposals are not &#8230; beneficial to the economic well-being of Northern Ireland and they undermine the integrity of the Union&#8221; of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.britannica.com\/place\/United-Kingdom\">United Kingdom<\/a> of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/duponline\/status\/1184823399438323712\">the DUP said in a statement<\/a>. Johnson was &#8220;too eager by far to get a deal at any cost,&#8221; Nigel Dodds, the DUP&#8217;s deputy leader, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.itv.com\/news\/2019-10-17\/we-ve-got-a-great-new-deal-boris-johnson-and-jean-claude-juncker-agree-on-brexit\/\">told reporters<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What is the Democratic Unionist Party&#8217;s problem with the deal?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The DUP is worried that if Northern Ireland is linked with Ireland on EU trade, customs and even some regulations, that could drive a wedge between Northern Ireland and the rest of the U.K. The party is adamant that Northern Ireland should remain part of the U.K. and never join the Irish Republic to its south.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Why is avoiding a customs border on the island of Ireland so important? <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Both Ireland and the U.K. are members of the EU, and the border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic is open and seamless. It is no longer the symbol of division and violence it once was during the conflict between Protestants and Catholics in the last century. Customs checks along the Irish border would emphasize the partition of the island, and there are fears that the goodwill developed since the 1998 Good Friday peace agreement would be lost and that there could even be violent attacks on customs posts.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Has the fear of Britain leaving the EU without a deal now receded?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A no-deal Brexit now seems much less likely. There is considerable political will to get this deal approved. If it fails in Parliament, Johnson is required to seek another extension from Brussels to enable more negotiations. Yet British government ministers and EU politicians say they hope the deal will pass and there will be no need for a further delay beyond Oct. 31.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What&#8217;s next?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>All eyes will turn to the British Parliament on Saturday to see whether Johnson can push this deal through. People will march through the streets of London to call for a second referendum to give voters a &#8220;final say&#8221; on Johnson&#8217;s withdrawal agreement, with an option to stay in the EU. If British lawmakers approve Johnson&#8217;s deal, the U.K. will legally leave the EU at the end of this month, but it will enter a transition period in which all the current rules remain the same to avoid disruption as the U.K. and EU negotiate a new relationship. The transition period would run to the end of December 2020.  <\/p>\n<div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2019 NPR.

Like other European countries, Ireland has been in a period of austerity \u2014 higher taxes and more cutbacks.<\/p>\n<p>The nation&#8217;s technology sector has been protected, however, as Ireland makes a concerted effort to attract foreign businesses through tax incentives and development programs.<\/p>\n<p>But Ireland&#8217;s methods have also been criticized \u2014 locally and internationally.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Apple In Ireland<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The government&#8217;s heavy hand in growing its tech industries has raised some eyebrows around the world. One tech company with offices in Ireland drew the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.npr.org\/2013\/05\/21\/185688463\/ceo-cook-to-defend-apple-before-senate-committee-hearing\">watchful eye of the U.S. Senate<\/a> earlier this year: Apple.<\/p>\n<p>Apple has been in Ireland for 30 years. But it drew attention in May when it came to light that Apple kept 70 percent of its profits under the umbrella of its Irish subsidiary.<\/p>\n<p>Ireland&#8217;s corporate tax rate is 12.5 percent, compared to more than 30 percent in the U.S. Ireland has loopholes that make it possible for companies like Apple to pay almost nothing.<\/p>\n<p>In May, Apple CEO Tim Cook was grilled by Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona. Cook chafed at accusations that Apple&#8217;s offices in Ireland were simply a shell for profits.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The relationship between Apple and the Irish government is still there today, and we built up a sizable population,&#8221; he insisted before McCain jumped in.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;With all due respect,&#8221; he told Cook, &#8220;given the tax rate that you are paying in Ireland, I&#8217;m sure you have a very close relationship.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In October, in the wake of growing international pressure, Ireland announced it was closing a loophole. Off the record, at least a few company executives told me that it was the low rate that kept them in Ireland.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Grants And Pub Crawls<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Yet Ireland&#8217;s efforts to draw more tech companies to its shores go beyond tax incentives.<\/p>\n<p>A few weeks ago, the Nasdaq moved its opening bell to Dublin to kick off <a href=\"http:\/\/2013.websummit.net\/\">Web Summit<\/a>, the largest tech conference in Europe. With financial support from the government, the tech conference brought business leaders and journalists \u2014 including me \u2014 to Ireland.<\/p>\n<p>Enda Kenny, Ireland&#8217;s prime minister, rang the bell. He proclaimed to conference attendees that Ireland is &#8220;the most open economy in the Western world. And we celebrate our pro-business ethos and environment without hesitation.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Tech entrepreneurs say Ireland&#8217;s low tax rate is just one item on an appealing checklist that includes an army of Irish officials ready to help foreign companies set up \u2014 usually with Ireland&#8217;s Industrial Development Agency, or IDA.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Our engineers, they love them because they take them out for whiskey crawls and pub crawls and these different things,&#8221; says Mikkel Svane, the CEO of customer-support software company Zendesk.<\/p>\n<p>Zendesk has its headquarters in San Francisco, and it just chose Ireland to be its European headquarters.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s just a lot of experience here because they have attracted over the years so many tech companies,&#8221; Svane says. &#8220;They have the machine rolling, and they&#8217;re prepared for companies like us. They know what we need.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Barry O&#8217;Dowd, head of the IDA&#8217;s emerging business division, spoke with me while taking some American entrepreneurs on a pub crawl.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We help the companies when they&#8217;re here, and we get them sort of locked into the economy,&#8221; O&#8217;Dowd says. &#8220;We work with them on [research and development] agendas, for instance. We&#8217;ve got a grant and aid support program where we can give them support financially.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>According to O&#8217;Dowd, the development agency&#8217;s recent efforts to attract newer companies, like Zendesk, have created between 2,000 and 3,000 new positions. O&#8217;Dowd says the companies&#8217; presence helps spawn other local jobs \u2014 although two-thirds of the jobs by foreign firms go to people who aren&#8217;t Irish.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Investment From Silicon Valley<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Ireland competes with other European countries to draw tech investment: Amsterdam, Berlin, London. But Jennifer Schenker, editor-in-chief at Informilo \u2014 a magazine that covers the global tech industry \u2014 says Ireland stands out.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;They are, bar none, the most proactive government in Europe in trying to attract tech companies of all sizes,&#8221; she says.<\/p>\n<p>But beyond that, she says, Ireland is creating an ecosystem. The country&#8217;s workforce is highly educated and young \u2014 50 percent of the population is under 35. Young Irish techies often start work at a foreign company and then leave to do their own start-up.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Some of Silicon Valley&#8217;s most famous angel investors are investing in very early-stage companies based in Dublin that have been founded by Irish entrepreneurs,&#8221; she says.<\/p>\n<p>Certainly the country hopes that, someday, a company the size of Google or Apple will emerge from its startup scene.<\/p>\n<p>But Chris Horn, an Irish former entrepreneur-turned-angel investor, says homegrown businesses face a steeper tax bill than foreign ones. If a company goes public, Irish entrepreneurs face a capital gains rate of more 30 percent on their profits.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;And what drives places like Silicon Valley and indeed Boston and New York,&#8221; he says, &#8220;is the growth of companies and then their sale and then the reinvestment of those profits and proceeds into the next companies.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Still, despite the criticism, Irish officials say the combination of low tax rates and government support is building a tech industry that&#8217;s helping to lift it out of the economic doldrums.  <\/p>\n<div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2013 NPR.

Stier says economically, the federal workforce is D.C.&#8217;s &#8220;most central element.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201d Though Yesim Sayin, executive director of nonprofit D.C. Policy Center, says the federal workforces&#8217; economic importance has \u201cgreatly diminished\u201d \u2013 in part because of remote work (In D.C., federal buildings use only about <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.pbrb.gov\/files\/2024\/03\/3.21.24-FINAL-PBRB-Interim-Report.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">12%<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> of their office space on average).<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cIt\u2019s not zero,\u201d Sayin says. \u201cBut it\u2019s much less than it was back in 2019.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">She says the city can\u2019t rely on the federal workforce or jobs to secure its economic future and should look to other strategies, like investing in housing.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">However, the District\u2019s ability to shape that future may hinge on this election.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Tom Sherwood, resident political analyst of WAMU\u2019s <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Politics Hour,<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> says if Trump wins and Republicans control Congress, there\u2019ll be much more interference with D.C.\u2019s local government \u2013 at minimum.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cAt worst, our government will cease to exist,\u201d he says.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The D.C. government exists only because of the <a href=\"https:\/\/dccouncil.gov\/dc-home-rule\/\">Home Rule Act<\/a> \u2013 congressional law passed in 1973. Congress can choose to strike it down.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Sherwood says that might seem extreme, but also that we live in extreme times. \u201cIt is the worst possibility. But it is entirely realistic,\u201d he added.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Top city officials like Mayor Muriel Bowser have refrained from publicly going into detail about worst case scenarios for local government (Bowser declined an interview with WAMU for this story). But she has said that Trump\u2019s threats &#8211; including unleashing the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2024\/10\/21\/nx-s1-5155005\/trump-threatens-to-use-the-military-and-doj-to-go-after-those-who-are-disloyal\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">military<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> on the American people &#8211; should be taken seriously.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cUntil we become a state, we are susceptible to people trampling on our autonomy,\u201d Bowser has said.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Regardless of who wins the presidency, union leader Ashaki Robinson says she\u2019s committed to her mission: serving the people. In her 18 years living in the region, she says she\u2019s put down\u00a0 \u201cblood and tears.\u201d She raised her kids here.

Region","content":"<p>Fall is in full swing, and that means it&#8217;s time for one of the region&#8217;s most beloved pastimes, leaf-peeping!<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;re a little bit past peak fall foliage, but there&#8217;s still time to take in the season&#8217;s vibrant colors. This week on Get Out There, WAMU&#8217;s Kayla Hewitt shared some recommendations on where to see the most brightly colored leaves.<\/p>\n<p>But first, to learn a little more about the leaf color changing process, Hewitt reached out to an expert, Shenandoah National Park botanist <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=T4JgNgoIL0w\">Wendy Cass<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Cass told Hewitt that as the seasons change and the days get shorter, the leaves are cut off from the tree&#8217;s vascular system. &#8220;Without that influx of nutrients, the chlorophyll that&#8217;s in the leaf breaks down in the sunlight and it reveals these other colors that have been in the leaf all along, but they were just masked by the green of the chlorophyll,&#8221; Cass said.\u00a0\u00a0The reds of the season come from extra sugars in the leaf mixing with the chlorophyll, creating a new red pigment called anthocyanin.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to catch those reds, yellows and oranges at Shenandoah, Cass recommends checking out the park&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nps.gov\/shen\/planyourvisit\/maps.htm\">lower elevations<\/a>, in the northern and and southern regions. If you&#8217;re looking to do some leaf-peeping a little closer to home, check out a\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/dnr.maryland.gov\/publiclands\/pages\/parkmap.aspx\">Maryland State Park<\/a>. Folks wanting to stay inside the city limits should try out a hike in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nps.gov\/rocr\/index.htm\">Rock Creek Park<\/a>, check out the <a

Glenn Youngkin ordered. He told state election officials to remove people daily, saying he was targeting people who identified as noncitizens during DMV transactions.<\/p>\n<p>Republicans nationwide have said that noncitizens are voting in the 2024 election, a claim not supported by evidence. Court records in Virginia don\u2019t show noncitizens being charged with illegally voting in the last 20 years. A\u00a0<a class=\"Link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.brennancenter.org\/our-work\/research-reports\/noncitizen-voting-missing-millions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-cms-ai=\"0\">study by the Brennan Center for Justice<\/a>\u00a0said only 2 of 42 jurisdictions it analyzed had instances of noncitizen voters in the 2016 election.<\/p>\n<p>Former President Donald Trump has claimed \u201cmillions\u201d of noncitizens voted in that election, which he won.<\/p>\n<p>Illegally voting as a noncitizen can carry charges of perjury and result in deportation.<\/p>\n<p>On Aug. 7, Youngkin issued an executive order directing the agencies maintaining lists of registered voters to do it more frequently. EO 35 claimed that since January 2022, Virginia had removed 6,303 people for saying they were a noncitizen at the DMV, either on purpose or by accident. The number could be smaller because of the way that Virginia tracks those records, an administration official told VPM News.<\/p>\n<p>The governor\u2019s order was challenged by the U.S. Department of Justice and a coalition of Virginia civic groups in early October, under the federal National Voter Registration Act\u2019s 90-day \u201cquiet period.\u201d The 1993 law says states cannot remove voters systematically from voter rolls in that time frame. Aug. 7, the day it was issued, was exactly 90 days before Election Day, leading to speculation that it was intended to trigger a court case.<\/p>\n<p>The Supreme Court did not give a rationale for issuing the stay in its order; it noted that Associate Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson voted to deny Virginia\u2019s request. Ultimately the court\u2019s order \u2014 and Virginia\u2019s enhanced purge process \u2014 could end if it later declines to review the case.<\/p>\n<p>In the immediate term, it\u2019s unclear what nationwide effect of this will have on voter registrations. Bertrall Ross, director of the Karsh Center for Law and Democracy at the University of Virginia, wrote in an email that the NVRA would prevent people being removed from voter lists.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis process takes much longer than the six days we have until the general election,\u201d he wrote, adding that it could mean purges of voter rolls in the months before an election, depending on how the Supreme Court resolves the question.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIf, for example, the Supreme Court holds that state actors can purge the voter rolls of suspected non-citizens anytime before an election, then states will be permitted [to] purge voter rolls 90 days before the next election after the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, which would probably be the 2026 midterms.\u201d<\/p>\n<div class=\"Enh\" data-align-center=\"\"><\/div>\n<p>Amanda Wintersieck, director of the Institute for Democracy, Pluralism and Community Empowerment at Virginia Commonwealth University, said the messaging around noncitizens is a partisan strategy to lay groundwork for challenging the election results after Tuesday.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI would say that this is a grand narrative and that it&#8217;s not a new narrative,\u201d said Wintersieck. \u201cWe&#8217;re seeing a full court press for nearly a year in advance of this election: setting up legal arguments and denialism for the event that he doesn&#8217;t win the election.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Protect Democracy, a nonprofit founded by two lawyers who worked in President Barack Obama\u2019s administration, said in an email Tuesday that the new processes are laying the\u00a0<a class=\"Link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.ifyoucankeepit.org\/p\/the-deceive-disrupt-deny-strategy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-cms-ai=\"0\">groundwork to overturn election results<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Anthony Ashton, associate general counsel for the NAACP, raised the same concern in a press conference Wednesday.<\/p>\n<p>Youngkin, speaking to reporters in Petersburg on Wednesday, didn\u2019t directly answer a question from VPM News on whether this would enable challenges to election results.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI think the bottom line is we have a process in Virginia that&#8217;s been literally run for 18 years. It is a very straightforward process,\u201d he said. Virginia\u2019s voter maintenance law was first cleared by the Department of Justice in 2006, during Democratic Gov. Tim Kaine\u2019s tenure. The\u00a0<a class=\"Link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/archive\/local\/1995\/07\/07\/va-motorvoter-suit\/5a88376f-26c1-4ee5-aa99-5fc253e4d4be\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-cms-ai=\"0\">DOJ sued Virginia in 1995<\/a>\u00a0to have it comply with the NVRA.<\/p>\n<div class=\"Enh\" data-align-center=\"\">\n<div><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>It\u2019s not clear how many citizens were removed from voter rolls. Brent Ferguson, a lawyer for the civic groups, said in an email that numbers Virginia presented to SCOTUS were first seen by the plaintiffs \u2014 Virginia Coalition for Immigrant Rights, League of Women Voters of Virginia, League of Women Voters of Virginia Education Fund and African Communities Together \u2014 Friday in the state\u2019s appeal to the U.S. 4th Circuit Court of Appeals.<\/p>\n<p>Virginia said in its emergency filing that 600 of the 1,600 \u201cpersonally informed Virginia\u2019s Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) that they are not citizens,\u201d and 1,000 presented residency documents for noncitizens, and were identified in an immigration database as noncitizens.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe are not completely certain if or how these numbers add up,\u201d said Ferguson. \u201cPart of the problem here is that we\u2019ve received only a small amount of information from the defendants, and it\u2019s impossible to verify \u2013 most of it is just in the form of unsupported assertions.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Ferguson told VPM News last week that the plaintiffs had been seeking information from the administration since Youngkin\u2019s order was issued in August, but the administration \u201cstonewalled.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThere&#8217;s been no conclusive evidence that any of the voters removed are actually not citizens,\u201d Ferguson said Wednesday. \u201cWe&#8217;ve spoken with dozens of voters, who are eligible citizens, who have been removed.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Petersburg General Registrar Dawn Wilmoth said she had at least one U.S. citizen come in to re-register after she was removed. The voter said she had visited the DMV, but didn\u2019t remember marking a box indicating she wasn\u2019t a citizen.<\/p>\n<p>If voters did not re-register by Oct. 15, they will not be able to vote by mail. They will have to same-day register at their early voting or Election Day polling stations and cast a provisional ballot \u2014 which will be evaluated by their local board of elections for validity.<\/p>\n","paginatedContent":[],"excerpt":"<p>Now 1,600 removed voters will remain off the rolls in Virginia.
