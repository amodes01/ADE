Both have desire to limit regional isolation. For Turkey, this has been particularly acute. The agreement was a bitter pill for Erdogan, who feels strong personal sympathy for Palestinians. The failure to lift Gaza blockade significant. The deal points to fact that Erdogan, who is often framed as an ideologue, is capable of realism. It also points to his absolute control over local press, which is framing the deal as a Turkish victory.\\\"  Eissenstat is an expert in Turkish affairs.

Contact: Mike Krings, [email protected]  Robert Boatright  Professor, Political Science  Clark University (Massachusetts)  \\\"Regarding the conventions, I will be looking at whether Republican elites -- donors, leaders of Super PACs, etc. -- find a compelling reason to stick with Trump. My expectation is that if Trump is still down in the polls once the conventions have concluded, most in the party will cut him loose and focus on minimizing party losses in the House and Senate. Things like this have happened before, but they have never happened as suddenly as was the case this year.\\\"  Boatright studies political interest groups, campaign finance, American political behavior, political participation and political theory.  Website: http://www.clarku.edu  Contact: Jane Salerno, [email protected]  Seth Masket  Associate Professor and Chair of Political Science  University of Denver  \\\"Modern party conventions have become pretty straightforward events that just ratify decisions that party voters made months earlier. This year could be different, particularly on the Republican side. There is a significant chance we will see some delegates rebel against the party's presumptive nominee and attempt to choose someone else. We could see some real drama on the floor in Cleveland.\\\"  Masket is the author of \\\"The Inevitable Party: Why Attempts to Kill the Party System Fail and How They Weaken Democracy\\\" (Oxford University Press, 2016).

What's motivating partisans to vote in this climate? For too many of them, it's not high-minded, good-government, issue-based goals. It's, 'I hate the other party.

That's troubling.\\\"  Miller monitors national polling related to the presidential campaign that is made available and tweets analysis at Twitter.com/pmiller1693.
