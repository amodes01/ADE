"{\"uid\": \"www.theguardian.com.-cities-2016-jul-01-canadexit-escape-donald-trump-nigel-farage-brexit-move-to-canada\", \"text\": \"In the wake of Brexit and with the rise of Donald Trump, Richard Nixon now seems like a quaint historical curiosity. Were Tricky Dicky's revivified corpse to shamble on stage at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland later this month to demand the nomination, it would probably be hailed as an improvement. However, there was a time when decent Americans saw Nixon as an unprecedented threat to democracy.  One of those Americans was my grandfather. When Nixon was elected vice-president in 1952, my grandfather made good on that perennial threat of outraged American liberals throughout history: he loaded the family into the station wagon, drove up the coast from Orange County to Salmon Arm, British Columbia, and settled in Canada.    So it's in part thanks to Nixon that I now live and work in Toronto, having carried on the family tradition of making existential life decisions without thinking them through by using my Canadian passport to move from Australia. The Canada I moved to seven years ago was thought of as a pleasant backwater: cold, bland.  But Canada has become something very different. For one thing, Canada now has Drake, and a prime minister who can credibly claim to have had sex. For another, the US and the UK are voting their way toward national cosplays of Children of Men, and the less credulous among their populations are eyeing the exits.  Google searches for 'how do I move to Canada' spiked in the UK following the Brexit vote  Google searches for \\\"how do I move to Canada\\\" spiked in the UK following the Brexit vote, in inverse correlation to the value of the pound. Trump has already begun challenging his critics to make the move, perhaps anticipating the gulags (fabulous gulags, the best gulags) he will establish in our frozen north.  Though frequently cited as an empty threat, it's not unreasonable for Brits and Yanks anticipating a future transatlantic summit between God-Emperors Trump and Farage to contemplate a move to Canada. Many have come before.  View image in fullscreen ... run away! Photograph: AP  Our first wave of disgruntled immigrants crossed the Bering Land Bridge into North America some 40,000 years ago, although history does not record the identity of the neanderthal real estate tycoon they were fleeing. Their First Nations ancestors were later displaced by Americans, loyal to the British crown, who fled the Revolutionary War. During the 19th century, somewhere between 30,000 and 100,000 escaped slaves made their way to Canada on the Underground Railroad.    In the early 1900s they were followed in turn by the Doukhobors, a pacifist Russian sect who fled oppression in their homeland and resettled in the prairies of western Canada. Upon experiencing the reality of life in the prairies of western Canada, the Doukhobors regretted their decision, and devised a plan to return to Russia: they would force the Canadian government to repatriate them by stripping naked and setting fire to their own houses. Canadians are a patient people, but only to a point. The most devout of the Doukhoubors now live in Azerbaijan.  The next great wave of refugees arrived in the late 1960s and early 70s, when between 50,000 and 100,000 Americans chose to live in Canada rather than to fight in the Vietnam War. Deserters from America's subsequent wars continue to seek refuge here, as do Syrian refugees fleeing the consequences of those same wars.  So, how to move? And can it be done before Michael Gove and Donald Trump begin fumbling with launch codes in their sweaty fists?  It's not as easy as you might think. Americans with professional degrees can live and work in Canada with relative ease under Nafta, but for everyone else, the best strategy, as in all aspects of life, is to be hot. If you are married to or live with a Canadian citizen for a minimum of one year, they can sponsor you to become a permanent resident. In the era of the internet, seducing and then marrying a Canadian is easier than ever, and regardless of how unexceptional you were in your country of origin you will likely appear exotic to a Canadian. Act quickly, while your passport and currency still holds out some value to a potential partner.

Quotas apply, the application process can take years, and the system is weighted heavily toward middle-class professionals. While UK citizens might reasonably assume that our shared aristocracy would give them an advantage here, this is not the case. They are in fact subject to the same eligibility criteria as Americans - all the more reason to get the applications in before Trump's thousand-year reich begins in November.  Those who do not manage to escape the UK and the US immediately should consider taking advantage of Canada's refugee asylum system. While more humane than Europe and Australia's strategy of hoping the boats sink in someone else's waters, it is by no means perfect. The application process for Syrian refugees, for example, is also weighted towards middle-class professionals. Unaccompanied males are excluded.  Should your application nevertheless be successful, you then need to decide where to settle. It's not an exaggeration to say that 98% of Canada is a frozen wasteland. Of the remaining 2%:  Vancouver  Canada's only beautiful city has already been rendered unaffordable by the same borderless capital flows whose panicked stampedes are about to devastate London. Suitable for aspirational fregan employees of weed dispensaries and 17-year-old Lamborghini-driving daughters of Chinese Communist Party officials.

Perfect for #NeverTrump Americans who like their hats big, their politics pro-life, and their carbon emissions uncapped and un-traded.  St John's  Newfoundland is the Ireland of Canada, and its capital's friendly and incomprehensible inhabitants make it a good place to wait out a civilisational collapse.  Montreal  Much like the EU, Canada has its own group of plucky and troublesome separatists, willing to cripple their economy in a quixotic defence of the specialness of their culture. Brits spoiling for a second Brexit, or those nostalgic for the experience of being sneered at by Parisians for trying to speak French and eager to recreate that experience in a colder climate, should consider making Montreal their home.  Ottawa  Canada's seat of government is everything you would expect of \\\"Canada's seat of government\\\". Ideal for those who enjoy sitting and governing.  Quebec City  Montreal with less culture or vice, Ville de Qu\\u00e9bec is the perfect place to resettle any elderly Francophile aunts.  Toronto  Canada's largest city is now best-known for the antics of its late mayor, beloved domestic abuser and crack addict Rob Ford. His brief reign so ashamed Torontonians that they promptly elected a man so boring that his name is actually \\\"John Tory\\\", and whose soporific public persona might be particularly reassuring to Trump/Johnson refugees.  As for those of us already here, I think I am safe in saying that we are conflicted by Canada's status as a refuge for the politically dissatisfied. On one hand, we would prefer that control of the US and UK governments not fall into the hands of populist demagogues. On the other, periodic influxes of liberals are an electoral bulwark against their rise in our own country. On behalf of Canada, let me assure you that you are welcome here, but politely suggest that you consider standing and fighting.\"}"
