He noted that the \\\"special relationship\\\" that the U.S. has with Britain, as well as the close economic ties with the European Union, will endure. But he also spoke to challenges.  \\\"I do think that yesterday's vote raises challenges posed by globalization,\\\" Obama said. \\\"The world has shrunk, it is interconnected. Many of you are catalyzing and accelerating it. It promises to bring extraordinary benefits, and evokes extraordinary fears.\\\"  Obama went on to hold an on-stage conversation with Facebook's billionaire CEO Mark Zuckerberg and three foreign entrepreneurs. He called such young people \\\"the bridge, the glue\\\" that will help bring countries and culture together.\"}"
