Think Marine Le Pen's National Front in France, or Austria's far-right Freedom Party, which in April missed winning the presidency by less than a percentage point.

The backlash Brexit represents is understandable, according to Simon Fraser, who until last year was Britain's top career diplomat and is now a managing partner of Flint Global, a firm in London that advises corporations on how to navigate the EU. \\\"People are challenging the conventional wisdom around trade, openness and cooperation\\\" because they feel let down, says Fraser. That's by no means all the EU's fault. For decades, Brussels has served as a convenient scapegoat for national leaders looking to dodge blame for unpopular policies. But the EU has, like other institutions that set the terms of the global economy since World War II, failed to adapt to the upheavals that followed the end of the Cold War, according to Fraser. The question of how to integrate China and Russia, in particular, into largely Western-built economic and security structures was left unanswered. Those institutions were unable to help governments ameliorate inequality or the impact of globalisation on jobs and wages for many in the West. And yet, says Fraser, \\\"we need a system for running the world; you need systems that set shared rules\\\".  There is a word for where the world is heading now: \\\"G-zero,\\\" a label coined by Ian Bremmer, president of the Eurasia Group, a New York-based political-risk consultancy, and economist Nouriel Roubini in a Foreign Affairs article five years ago. The reference was to the progressive irrelevance of the G-7, G-8 and then G-20 to global governance. Trade was an early indicator. The last full-blown global deal was the so-called Uruguay Round in 1995. Since then, only partial and regional trade pacts have been achievable. Now, as support dwindles for the Trans-Pacific Partnership and a proposal to deepen commerce between the US and the EU, the prospects for even regional agreements are fading. \\\"Brexit fits very closely\\\" into this procession towards a world without collaborative international institutions, says Bremmer, noting that campaign on both sides has been almost entirely inward-looking. \\\"We have moved from a situation in which the transatlantic relationship was the most important thing, to everyone for themselves\\\". The US presidential contest has also been isolationist, forcing even Hillary Clinton to abandon support for the TPP trade deal she helped to get signed as secretary of state. As for Trump, his \\\"position is about as far as you can imagine from the US world order,\\\" says Bremmer. \\\"His view of the world is about who pays for the evening meal - you got the buffalo wings, you pay for them.\\\" Brexit may hold a more optimistic lesson, however, especially if the Remain camp wins. The changes under way could also produce new or restructured arrangements for international management, rather than the Hobbesian world Bremmer fears.  China's leaders, for example, have looked on with puzzlement at the British debate. China may champion national sovereignty and chafe at US dominance, but it is also pragmatic, says Kerry Brown, director of the Lau China Institute at King's College London. It gains from the existing economic order and sees multilateral economic institutions as useful - in the EU's case, to the tune of $US590 billion in trade last year. \\\"The UK is a very attractive destination for Chinese investment and financing, but after withdrawal from the EU it would be less interesting,\\\" says Brown. So when Chinese President Xi Jinping said on a visit to Britain last year that he wanted a united EU, with Britain helping to deepen Chinese-EU ties, he wasn't just chalking up a political favour to British Prime Minister David Cameron. Although the Brexit movement may well encourage similar efforts to leave in other EU countries, it is likely at the same time to accelerate new ideas to reshape the union, according to Davies. Already there are signs that some EU leaders have taken the message to heart. On Tuesday, German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said that even if Britain votes to stay, \\\"we will simply not be able to go on as before\\\". He called on Germans to recognise the EU's value to them and to understand that they do not carry an unfair share of its burden. Such calls to reform the EU have been made before - to little effect. In the long term, however, Europe can not simply return to a \\\"normal\\\" era in which nation states were pre-eminent, according to Davies, because that was never the norm but a brief and bloody aberration from other forms of European union, such as empire.\"}"
