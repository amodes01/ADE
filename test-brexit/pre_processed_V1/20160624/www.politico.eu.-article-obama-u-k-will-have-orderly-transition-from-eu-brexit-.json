Speaking during the annual Global Entrepreneurship Summit at Stanford University, Obama said he has spoken to British Prime Minister David Cameron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel since the U.K. narrowly voted to leave the EU on Thursday.  \\\"David has been an outstanding friend and partner on the global stage and based on our conversation I am confident the U.K. is committed to an orderly transition out of the EU,\\\" Obama said. \\\"We agreed that our economic and financial teams will remain in close contact as we stay focused on ensuring economic growth and financial stability.\\\"  Cameron announced earlier Friday that he would resign as prime minister following the vote.\"}"
