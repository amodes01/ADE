An influential Iranian filmmaker has died. How the art world gets \\\"Brexit\\\" all wrong. And helpful advice for George Lucas on how he might actually get his museum of narrative art built. Plus, President Obama's library architects, the Orange County Museum of Art moves forward with move plans and a series of urban hikes that take you past a San Fernando Valley neighborhood's splashy new murals. Here's the Roundup:  - Abbas Kiarostami, the Palme d'Or-winning Iranian director known for meditative pictures focused on the quests of everyday people and a figure whose entr\\u00e9e into the arts began as a student of painting at the University of Tehran, has died at the age of 76.  For the record: A previous version of this post reported that the Beretta family helped fund artist Christo's installation in Italy. The installation was funded by the artist.

Critics Christopher Hawthorne of The Times and Kriston Capps of Citylab say the selection is right in keeping with Obama's style.  - Speaking of architectural projects in Chicago, critic Blair Kamin writes that it was George Lucas' own hubris that cost him his museum project in Chicago. The film director is now looking at a San Francisco site, where Chronicle critic John King offers him some friendly advice for getting the deal sealed: \\\"The museum proposals had an air of preordained inevitability, as though we should be grateful for such blessings from above. Guess what. People do not like to be told what's good for them, especially in a city where change barrels toward us from all directions.\\\"  Advertisement  - Is movement finally afoot for the Orange County Museum of Art to relocate to a Thom Mayne-designed building in Costa Mesa? The museum's brass tells the O.C. Register that momentum is picking up.

(Filippo Venezia / Ansa via AP )  - Christo has said that his \\\"Floating Piers\\\" installation at Lake Iseo in Italy was purely an aesthetic intervention. But the project, writes Mike Watson, received logistical support from the Beretta arms manufacturing family - raising questions about whether an installation of this nature can truly be free of politics. Want to see it for yourself? An Italian website has gathered a collection of 360-degree videos of the install.  - Architectural critic Mark Lamster tells the story of a concrete-heavy Dallas tower designed by Paul Rudolph.
