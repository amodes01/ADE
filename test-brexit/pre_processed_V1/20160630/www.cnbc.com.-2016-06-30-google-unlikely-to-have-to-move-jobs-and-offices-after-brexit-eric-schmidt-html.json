Last week, Brits voted in referendum to leave the EU, sending financial markets into turmoil and sparking a political crisis in the U.K. There are many concerns over what this might mean for many of the EU laws that the U.K. is signed up for and companies are uncertain about what the future holds. Britain has yet to invoke Article 50 - the legal process that will lead to its exit from the EU.  Eric Schmidt, executive chairman of Alphabet, speaks on stage at the Viva Technology conference in Paris on Thursday, June 30. Arjun Kharpal | CNBC  A handful of firms have already talked about the possibility of moving operations out of the U.K.. Both Vodafone and airline easyJet are evaluating whether some jobs may have to be relocated. But despite the uncertainty, Schmidt said it'll be unlikely Google will start moving around employees and offices. \\\"I think it's unlikely Google will change our allocation ... we have large operations in Ireland in Britain in France, in Germany ... you never know, but it'd be hard for me to imagine we would make much of a change,\\\" Schmidt said during a speech at the Viva Technology conference in Paris. But the Alphabet chair expressed concern over the possibility of the European digital market becoming more fractured.  \"}"
