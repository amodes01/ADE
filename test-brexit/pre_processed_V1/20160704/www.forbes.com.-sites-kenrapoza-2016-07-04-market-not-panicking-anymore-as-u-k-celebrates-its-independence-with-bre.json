Remember when the U.K. referendum was supposed to bring fire and brimstone? It goes sort of like this: a famous hedge fund manager or two warns of grave danger, followed by market ideologues afraid of change. The drama queen media, always ready for a stock market Apocalypse, spread the word in the usual echo chamber of unenlightened sameness: the message is that the sky is falling.  Only, it is not. At least not in the equity markets.  Sure there was some trimming today. The FTSE 100 fell 0.84%. Germany's DAX settled 0.69%. France's CAC-40 fell nearly 1%. Thanks to China's central bank, the Shanghai stock market rose another 1.91% on July 4. It's a down day, but not a hellish day. This is the stock market on any given Monday, let us face it.  \\\"We do not think economies or risk markets will crash, but it is hard to be enthusiastic about the prospects for the post-BREXIT globe for the next few quarters,\\\" admits John Vail, Chief Global Strategist at Nikko Asset Management in New York. Nikko expects an average of about one percentage point will be lopped off from recent GDP trends in major countries during the next four quarters, while the U.K. will likely descend into a moderate recession. The same can be said about the U.S. Any number of macro traders have been forecasting the Fed to stand down on a pending rate hike months before Brexit even looked possible.  As far as financial markets are concerned, the impact of the Brexit referendum vote has been relatively calm. The major equity markets recovered their poise quickly. The FTSE100 index was up 7.2% last week and the index is up over 5% year-to-date in contrast to the experience of Eurozone equity markets. At the time of writing, the DAX is down 9.7% year-to-date and the Italian equity market is down more than 24%, which is being dented by the problems in the Italian banking sector.  Last week saw 10-year government bond yields in the U.S. and U.K. fall to record lows and remarkably in Switzerland, the entire curve now has negative yields. The 'gravitational pull' of negative-yielding global government bonds amounting to nearly $12 trillion in bonds that pay negative interest in Europe. With the gold price at a 2-year high, this might all be indicative of underlying risk aversion, thus pointing to potential recessionary risks that were in place even before the referendum vote two weeks ago now.  The European Central Bank will continue to remain in easing mode. The minutes of the last meeting get published this week. Peripheral Europe still has stresses in its banking system, but it is worth bearing in mind that the International Monetary Fund also said Germany's Deutsche Bank is the biggest systemic risk in Europe, not Brexit.  Economist and New York Times columnist Paul Krugman wrote in his recent blog that the near-universal consensus among economists that the U.K. \\\"independence\\\" vote constitutes a major negative shock to demand is flawed. Krugman says there is nothing in standard macroeconomic models which suggests the U.K. leaving the European Union is akin to an EU implosion on the demand side. Krugman writes that many of the consensus economics have been tarnished by \\\"politically motivated reasoning\\\" rather than sticking to impartial analysis.  Kennedy School professor Carmen Reinhart argues from Harvard University in Cambridge that Brexit has dealt a blow to globalization, especially in terms of trade and finance at a time when global trade has still not recovered its earlier trajectory post-Great Recession. Export volumes have risen at only about half the annual average rate of the pre-crisis period. Most economic models presumed a worst case scenario for Brexit, when the outcome remains largely unknown and will remain that way for much of the next two years. U.K. has until 2018 to officially be free of E.U. membership.  Nobody knows what Tuesday's going to bring on the NYSE. But it would appear that black-Friday panic over Brexit is no longer on the menu.\"}"
