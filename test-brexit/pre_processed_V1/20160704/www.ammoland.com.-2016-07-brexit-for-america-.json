The Magna Carta and Declaration of Independence were about overbearing, despotic kings. Brexit, Britain's decision to leave the European Union, was much about overbearing bureaucrats in Brussels.  This year's US elections likewise center on gaining a new measure of freedom from an authoritarian, unaccountable Executive Branch in Washington.  Like Brexit, they are also about We the People actually having a role in a democracy, a voice in how much power government will have over our lives.  The Brexit motto is fast becoming the driving force in 2016 politics: \\\"Take back control!\\\"  Today's ruling elites do not govern from positions of land ownership or birth, but from assertions of greater education, expertise and wisdom than supposedly possessed by citizens at large.  These ruling classes increasingly control our lands, the energy and minerals beneath them, and the lives, livelihoods and living standards of those beyond the DC Beltway. People are getting fed up.  A Financial Times headline just days after the Brexit vote read \\\"Clinton wary of populist contagion.\\\" She should be.  The very notion that people might vote to loosen the shackles of intrusive government is anathema to her. Like President Obama, Hillary Clinton shares the mindset that democracy is fine if angry liberals can be mobilized to elect an activist, wealth-redistributionist president to \\\"fundamentally transform\\\" America. It's unsettling and intolerable if conservatives mobilize to unelect this agenda.  Mrs. Clinton and her increasingly far-left party rightly worry that voters have had a bellyful of liberal-progressive policies that have rolled back economic growth, job creation, and incomes for poor, working class and minority families; unleashed waves of illegal immigration; and imposed massive cultural changes on our communities and military. And yet, right after the Brexit vote, Mrs. Clinton said:  \\\"Our first task has to be to make sure the economic uncertainty created by these events does not hurt working class families here in America.\\\" Talk about being insulated from reality.  Possible impacts from Britain's exit from the EU are hardly the issue. America's concern is the certain harm to working classes inflicted by Mr. Obama's policies - which Ms. Hillary promises to redouble if elected. Her comment to West Virginia's coal country electorate underscores her insensitive disdain.  \\\"I am going to put a lot of coal miners out of jobs,\\\" she informed them. And she will not stop there.  Germany, Britain and Poland are finally awakening to the ways exorbitant prices for subsidized, unreliable wind and solar electricity are hammering their poor and middle class families, destroying their international competitiveness, and driving their steel, auto, ceramics and other industries out of business.  But Mrs. Clinton has also vowed to regulate hydraulic fracturing into oblivion, and ban mining and drilling on federally controlled lands that represent 30-85% of all real estate in Alaska and America's western states. Her rabid environmentalist base wants to rid these areas of ranching and grazing, as well.  The economic impacts will roll through states and communities like successive tsunamis. Mrs. Clinton, her media and intellectual supporters, and ruling elites will likely respond as they always do.  \\\"What difference at this point does it make?\\\" she ranted at lawmakers who dared to question her lies and incompetence in the deaths of Ambassador Chris Stevens and his heroic security team in Benghazi.  \\\"Shoulda, coulda, woulda. We did not,\\\" the then-First Lady contemptuously responded to suggestions that she and President Clinton mishandled financial reports on their Whitewater land deals. She gave the same dismissive answer to \\\"impertinent\\\" questions about her improper State Department email server.  \\\"Every survivor of sexual assault deserves to be heard, believed, & supported,\\\" she tweeted in 2015. But if they are victims of her husband's sexual predations, she labels them \\\"trailer trash,\\\" like Gennifer Flowers, or slimes and pressures them to shut up, like Juanita Broaddrick and other women.  Like Mr. Obama and other elites, she surrounds herself with armed security details - and then demands more gun control when unarmed or disarmed Americans are murdered in Orlando, San Bernardino or Fort Hood \\u2026 while scrubbing press releases and cell phone transcripts of any mention of Islamist motives.  The Obama Justice Department prosecuted ex-Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell over a watch and meeting arrangements. (An 8-0 Supreme Court decision threw out the conviction.) But the DOJ was silent about Secretary of State Clinton appointing Rajiv Fernando to the International Security Advisory Board, giving him access to ultra-sensitive intelligence - when his only apparent \\\"qualification\\\" was raising millions of dollars for Mrs. Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign, donating hundreds of thousands to the Clinton Foundation, and giving tens of thousands to Hillary PACs.  The extensive quid-pro-quo of $200,000 Bill and Hill speeches and special deals for Wall Street, Saudi and other supplicants - swelling Clinton Foundation coffers - has received similar DOJ inattention.  Obama, Clinton and other Democrat kids go to pricey, private prep schools - while they oppose funding for charter schools that give poor and minority kids a chance to escape inner city life. They demand full integration of middle-income neighborhoods, but live in segregated, gated communities.  Those who dare question government diktats gets targeted or audited by the IRS, or even find armed SWAT teams bursting through their doors.  Legal immigrants face slow, expensive processing - while illegals from Latin America receive healthcare and education, live in sanctuary cities, and rarely get deported for crimes. 99% of Syrian refugees arriving under the latest Obama decree are Muslims, even as Christians are being exterminated in Syria and Iraq.  More and more, it seems, our government does whatever it decides the times demand - even when it means stifling innovation, growth, jobs and incomes for everyone except bureaucrats and crony corporatist friends, whose decisions, arrangements, perks and pensions are sacrosanct.  \\\"As president, I can do whatever I want,\\\" President Obama has said. If it was meant as a joke, few are laughing. On June 30, total government debt hit a record $19.4 trillion, a jump of nearly $98 billion from the day before. Our kids and their future generations will pay the price.  Elites impose healthcare, climate change, red-ink and transgender agendas - and then go apoplectic over Donald Trump's controversial remarks. There is a \\\"clear consensus\\\" among intellectual, political and media elites that Donald Trump is \\\"ill-suited to be president,\\\" we repeatedly hear.  By contrast, Mrs. Clinton offers the \\\"calm, steady, experienced leadership\\\" we need in these uncertain times. Such as what we have seen on Benghazi, emails, energy, economics and sexual assault?  Ronald Reagan once asked, \\\"If no one among us is capable of governing himself, then who among us has the capacity to govern someone else?\\\"  Indeed, who in government has the wisdom, knowledge or right to govern the rest of us, especially with the iron fist they increasingly employ - and with no transparency or accountability?  We gained independence from Britain over far less serious Abuses and Usurpations. Let us hope we can at least have an angry populace election in 2016. And if Mr. Trump can formulate, articulate and implement sound, practical, job-creating, economy-stimulating policies - and enough voters can unite around him and those policies - America might get its own Brexit from tyrannical centralized, leftist government.
