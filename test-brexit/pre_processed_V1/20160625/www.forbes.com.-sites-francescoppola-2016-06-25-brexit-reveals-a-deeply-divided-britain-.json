The BBC relayed the results live, color-coding the decisions on a map of the UK. Yellow for Remain, blue for Leave. As district after district announced its decision to Leave the European Union, the map slowly turned blue.  As dawn broke, the leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP), Nigel Farage, claimed victory. \\\"This is a victory for real people, a victory for ordinary people, a victory for decent people. We fought against the multinationals, the merchant bankers and big politics\\\", he said. \\\"Let June 23rd go down in history as our Independence Day\\\".  But the truth is very different. This was not a victory for \\\"real people\\\" against \\\"the establishment\\\". Nor was it an angry British population lashing out against its oppressors. No, the truth is that this was a victory of some groups of British people over other groups. It was a victory of the old over the young: rural and coastal dwellers over city dwellers: the old industrial heartlands over the upstart London: England over Scotland. Brexit has revealed deep rifts in the social fabric of the UK. The referendum ripped the sticking plaster off the gaping wounds that are the legacy of the Thatcher years. The United Kingdom can no longer claim to be united.  The cracks were already showing long before the referendum. UKIP had been growing in popularity for several years, particularly in coastal and rural areas where concern over immigration and anger at the EU's many policy failures are at their highest. The area where I live, Rochester & Strood, briefly elected a UKIP member of Parliament in a high-profile by-election, though we threw him out at the General Election six months later. UKIP supporters were easily recognizable: middle-aged and elderly working-class men, the kind who sit drinking beer in the Working Men's Club in Strood and moan about immigration, bankers, employers and - above all - the EU. Older women, too, who chat in the supermarkets about the cost of living and how they can not get appointments at the local health center because of the immigrants. The referendum gave these people a chance to go beyond merely complaining that \\\"Britain is going to the dogs\\\". For once, they could act to change it. And they did.  The EU is their scapegoat, a proxy for everything that they hate. Petty laws telling them what they can and can not do, such as the EU's recent decision to control e-cigarettes. Taxes, particularly the hated Value Added Tax (VAT): most recently, what was seen as the EU's imposition of VAT on women's sanitary products helped to fuel the Brexit campaign. And above all, immigrants. Immigrants from Eastern Europe coming here because of the EU's free movement of people policy, taking our jobs, undercutting our wages, living in our houses, sending their children to our schools, clogging up the health service. Refugees from the Middle East coming here because the EU can not control its borders, threatening our security and ruining our culture.  Much of this is misinformation peddled through sections of the UK's media. The Economist says that the Daily Mail, Daily Express and Telegraph routinely misreport \\\"facts\\\" about the EU. The European Commission's website routinely debunks myths, at times trenchantly. Quality UK media do so too, as do EU-friendly UK politicians. But it is all to avail. The EU is the enemy, and nothing it says can be believed. Those who in any way support it are tainted too.  But this deeply entrenched anti-EU sentiment is by no means universal. \\\"We want our country back\\\" resonates with older people who remember with nostalgia the UK of old, before the evil EU deprived it of its sovereignty. But for young people who have only known the UK in the EU, it is meaningless. For them, the EU's open borders are a boon, not a bane: they can work and study anywhere in Europe. They see government policy, not immigration, as the primary cause of low wages and pressure on local services. And although they may be angry about tax, they see that too as primarily due to government policy, not the EU. Perhaps most fundamentally of all, they see themselves as British Europeans, not simply as British. Their anger is aimed much more at \\\"baby boomers\\\", whom they believe had security, prosperity and opportunity that is being denied to them. This is as distorted a view as that of the older people who say \\\"young people today\\\" are feckless, lazy and/or thick. But it reinforces the sense of alienation. And Brexit makes this much, much worse.  Older people voted for Brexit: the older they were, the more likely they were to vote to leave. Young people, especially those aged 18-25, voted overwhelmingly to remain in the EU. They are understandably furious with older people about the result. But in last year's General Election, only 43% of that age group bothered to vote, compared with 78% of over-65s. The same may well have been true in the referendum. My 18-year-old daughter (who did vote) complained that her friends would discuss the referendum on social media, but they would not vote. Young people feel disenfranchised, but their own behavior reinforces this. Brexit is to some extent a reflection of the disengagement of young people from the political process.  And it is also a reflection of the growing fragmentation of the UK. The BBC's map of England and Wales turned blue: but Scotland and Northern Ireland turned yellow. Scotland, in particular, voted overwhelmingly to remain in the EU. This will reinforce calls for a second independence referendum in Scotland. It may also reignite the campaign for reunification of Northern Ireland with its southern neighbor, Ireland, which has no plans to leave the EU.  Nor do the fault lines run only between the countries that make up the UK. England, by far the largest of the four, is also deeply split, with the industrial \\\"heartlands\\\" voting to Leave but London voting to Remain. This reflects long-term dissatisfaction with the direction of the UK economy. The UK is a service economy, and the cosmopolitan, services-dominated London is the heart of it. Heavy manufacturing industries and mining, especially in the Midlands and North of England, were systematically trashed in the 1980s and have never really recovered. Older people there, who remember the glory days of industrial strength and dream of its return, are angry at the success of the upstart London - especially as they believe they paid for its bailout in 2008. They see themselves as the \\\"real people\\\", and London as a \\\"bubble\\\" dominated by bankers and politicians.  London may respond to this antagonism in a way they do not expect. It is, after all, one of the biggest and most prosperous cities in the world, with a larger population than the whole of Scotland. There are already suggestions that if Scotland could go it alone, so too could London. \\\"The idea of London and Scotland becoming free trade zones has to be explored\\\", said Anthony Painter of the London-based Royal Society of Arts in a tweet. \\\"The UK is no longer a single political entity\\\".  Rather than \\\"getting their country back\\\", the victorious nationalists have pushed the UK further down the road towards dissolution. But the roots of this really lie in the disastrous economic policies of successive UK governments, which have created a deeply divided country. If those divisions cannot be healed, then Brexit signals the beginning of the end of the United Kingdom.\"}"
