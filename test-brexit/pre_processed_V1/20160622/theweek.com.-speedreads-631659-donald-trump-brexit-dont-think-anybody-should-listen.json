When asked Wednesday how he feels about the possibility of the United Kingdom leaving the EU, Trump said it was his \\\"inclination\\\" that they should get out. But \\\"I do not think anybody should listen to me [because] I have not really focused on it very much,\\\" the potential next leader of the free world said.  On Thursday, Britain will decide whether to remain or leave the EU, a decision that has threatened to divide Europe. The implications are radical for the United States: Following World War II, the EU brought stability and order to Europe, and as a single unit it has helped the U.S. with geopolitical responsibilities around the world. On the economic front alone, President Obama has urged against a Brexit, saying it could take as many as 10 years for Britain to negotiate new trade deals with the States.
