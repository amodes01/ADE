She narrowly escaped a gruesome tragedy when Bollywood tried to bludgeon her brain to the size of a pea, but she ducked at the right moment and escaped miraculously unharmed; she is now a popular columnist as well and is currently in the process of creating lame jokes like ' Why do all Hindu boys worship their mother? Because their religion tells them to worship the cow.' She firmly believes that nothing in life is sacred except laughter. (Not even her name, which she is secretly trying to change to Chetali Bhagat so that her columns get made into movies.) LESS ... MORE  Thursday: The man of the house does not like driving, especially along these alien Italian roads, and when I say, 'Take that left exit!' he ignores me.  After driving around in five circles, we realize that as usual I was right and the left exit was indeed the right one. This revelation leads to a massive argument till the prodigal son chirps up, 'Dad! Mom is just cranky, she must be getting her period. You know how she gets!'  To which I roar, 'That is sexist! Every time a woman is upset it's not because of her hormones! And if it were not for my periods, you would not be sitting in this car with that chocolate bar in your hand, mister!'  The prodigal son splutters, 'Mom, that's really unfair! I told you that I totally believe in gender equality when we had classes on that topic last semester. I just made a calculated deduction. See, your stomach is poking out a bit, you have a pimple on your chin, and you have been very irritable!'  'What are you, ACP Pradyuman from that CID show?' I holler, 'Mind your own business!'  Unfortunately, the prodigal son has the last laugh because just by sheer coincidence, an hour later, my body decides to give me its very own communist greeting with a cheery 'Lal Salaam!' And we have to make an emergency stop at the nearest pharmacy.  Friday: Sipping a cup of peppermint tea as tiny brown birds try to get at bits of jam and bread on our table, I get the news that like my teabag, Britain is also up to its neck in hot water.  'Brexit is a reality!' scream headlines and as people at the tables around us begin diluting their fresh orange juice with tears, watching their shares in Barclays and Lloyds drop down the rabbit hole, my friend's maasi, Daljeet Aunty, who has just joined us after a week in England, says, 'Sanu ki! I was just telling your uncle, as it is we had to get solo visa for England, this Europe wala Schengen visa does not work there, so we Indians are in same position like before only, of standing with folded hands at UK embassy, na? I toh wish this break-up shake-up would have happened a week earlier, then with the pound dropping, I would have got all my Marks things at half the rate. One thing is there, today you people are saying British are fools, but no one makes brassieres better than their Marks and Spencer, it is still world best in underclothes only!'  We then leave the consequences of Brexit along with our breakfast table to drive from Italy to Switzerland with just a nonchalant wave to the lone guard standing at the border gate. Long live the European Union!  Saturday: It's been a month of exits in India as Raghuram Rajan steps down as RBI governor and finance minister Arun Jaitley makes a hasty departure from China.  The person partly responsible for both seems to be BJP MP Subramanian Swamy who first declared that Mr Rajan was 'mentally not Indian enough' and then launched another missile at Mr Jaitley's sartorial style by stating that ministers should wear Indian clothes while abroad as they look like waiters in a coat and tie.  Mr Swamy then, according to unreliable sources, closely watched Ruby Rai, the 12th standard humanities topper from Bihar who got arrested after a TV interview where she said political science, a subject she aced, teaches cooking! In the re-exam where she was asked to write an essay on Tulsidas, she decided to respectfully write down the only thing she knew, 'Tulsidasji, Pranam.' Ruby Rai later confessed that it was all her father's fault; she had merely asked him to bribe and make her pass the exams but Daddyji had made her a topper instead.  Mr Swamy quickly added up 4+2 and came up with Char Sau Bees and declared that in Mr Arvind Kejriwal's case also it was his Daddyji who was responsible for his admission into IIT, a ploy to harass Mr Kejriwal on different issues till he too makes a hasty exit from his post.  Mr Swamy is a relentless warrior, who randomly slings disconnected weapons around in a wide arc, hoping that at least one of his rocks will land on someone, anyone's head.  I would not be surprised if Mr Swamy now blames Brexit on Vijay Mallya's settling down in England a few months ago, by tweeting to his 2.8 million followers, 'Midas touched anything and it turned to gold, Mallya touches anything and it folds #Brexit'.  Sunday: We have now reached New York and I decide to spend my time perfecting the art of window shopping. Walking down Fifth Avenue, I pass Trump Tower and see a crowd holding up signs, 'Vote for Trump, He is the savior and Hillary is a cheat!'  When I get home and tell the man of the house, he shows me a WhatsApp forward: 'US and UK are in a competition as to who is Dumb and who is Dumber, UK is in the lead but fear not the US has a Trump card.'  I begin giggling and like most Indians who deep down have always felt a bit intimidated by the Brits and the Yanks, as we grapple with their language trying to make it our own, I am secretly relieved.  It is finally apparent that those with the impeccable clipped accents or suave drawls are not so sagacious after all, and perhaps this clear display is enough for us Indians to make a hasty exit from our age-old inferiority complex as well.
