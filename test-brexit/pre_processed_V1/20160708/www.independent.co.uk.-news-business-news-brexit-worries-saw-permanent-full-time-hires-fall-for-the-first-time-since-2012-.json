The number of people placed in permanent positions fell in June, marking the first decline since September 2012, according to a report from Markit, a data company and the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC).  An index reading of 49.3 was recorded for permanent placements in June, down from 52.9 in May.  Data with reading below the 50 mark signals a decline on the previous month.  Salary growth for permanent and temporary roles also slowed to its lowest level since September 2013, according to data collected between 13 and 24 June.  Kevin Green, REC chief executive, said uncertainty during the run-up to the referendum saw many employers suspend permanent hiring and instead bring in temporary, contractor or interim staff to hedge against potential changes to their growth prospects.  \\\"Whilst it is too early to assess what the impact of the vote to leave the EU will be on jobs, our data underlines the need for uncertainty to be minimised so that our economy and our labour market are not adversely affected,\\\" Mr Green said.  \\\"The best thing for business right now is clear and calm leadership and as much clarity as possible on what the post-EU future will look like,\\\" he added.  Theresa May admits future of EU citizens living in the UK is uncertain  Mr Green said that the UK should stay part of the single market and retain access to skills across the EU to ensure the continued health of the country's labour market and the economy.  \\\"Before the referendum, businesses were already finding it increasingly hard to source the right candidates. Ensuring employers can still access the people they need to succeed must now be top of the list in any negotiations,\\\" he said.  The uncertainty following the vote to leave the EU has also weighted on recruitment.  In the week before the referendum almost 1.5 million jobs were advertised online, dropping to under 820,000 in the following week, according to CEB, a consultancy.  Brian Kropp, HR practice leader at CEB, said that the 47 per cent drop in job openings compared to last year was far outside the normal fluctuations seen by the company, which tend to be between 5 and 10 per cent.  A separate report by Boston Consulting Group (BCG) said London could be drained of 20 per cent of jobs as up to 80,000 banking and finance roles could be moved from the capital to other centre in Europe. This is worse than the 55,000 jobs lost in London's financial sector during the years of the financial crisis between 2007 and 2010.  Insurance, pharmaceutical and biotechnology jobs could also go, BCG said.\"}"
