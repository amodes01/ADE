Experts are unclear if an agreement between all four UK nations --- Scotland, Northern Ireland, England and Wales - was mandatory before London sends a letter to Brussels under Article 50 of the Treaty of Lisbon, which stipulates a two-year period for any member-state to leave the EU.

(Reuters)  \\\"If the Scottish Parliament was judging this on the basis of what's right for Scotland then the option of saying look we are not to vote for something that's against Scotland's interest, of course that's got to be on the table,\\\" she said.  Scotland voted to remain in the UK two years ago but hours after the Brexit results, Sturgeon indicated a new referendum was likely. Experts said the 2014 referendum had hinged on the benefits Scotland's young economy would gain from Britain's EU membership.  \\\"The context and the circumstances have changed dramatically. The UK that Scotland voted to remain within in 2014 does not exist anymore,\\\" she told television channels.

The 45-year-old leads the pro-independence Scottish National Party, which has 63 out of 129 seats in the Scottish parliament, as well as 54 out of 650 seats in House of Commons.  The prospect of re-drawing UK's borders comes amid mounting desperation and regret among British residents after Friday's referendum voted 52%-48% to leave the EU after a bitter campaign that saw bitter campaigning over immigration, jobs and a sentiment of \\\"taking Britain back\\\".

Many \\\"leave\\\" supporters indicated they had not taken into account the seismic economic and political fallout of ending the UK's 40-year membership in the EU. Discontent also grew in Northern Ireland and Scotland with two polls showing a majority of Scots supporting independence.\"}"
