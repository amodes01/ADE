It's the eve of the Brexit vote, meaning this time tomorrow the polls will be just hours away from closing. The result is likely to be known around Friday lunchtime Australian time or anywhere between 4am to 7am Friday morning London time. (Polls do not close until 10pm in the UK and they count all through the night.) Of course we will be live-blogging the events online, so make sure you keep Fairfax open in your browser for all the developments. Both sides had a bad final day of campaigning. On the Vote Leave side, Michael Gove was forced to apologise for making Nazi analogies, proving once again that when you start citing the Nazis to make your point, you really can not expect to end up anywhere good. But the bigger blow was delivered to Remain when the President of the EU Commission Jean-Claude Junker said the British should not to expect any further reform of the EU should it elect to stay. Unhelpful? Understatement!  Last night's BBC debate at Wembley Arena was most interesting for the stand-out performance of Ruth Davidson, who absolutely outclassed the rest on stage. Davidson is the Scottish Conservative leader but clearly destined for much bigger things. An excellent piece on an MP to watch in UK politics in the London Telegraph here. 3. Trump and Brexit 'It's not just Donald Trump. There is a global phenomenon going on and it ties up with all sorts of things going on in the world.' Credit: AP A few months ago I began to realise that what's at the heart of Trump's rise \\\"Make America great again\\\" and the Brexit push to \\\"take back control\\\" is essentially latent anti-globalisation movements. When I was a kid, globalisation was rarely talked about in any negative sense - the world was our oyster, we would all travel freely, communicate immediately and trade openly.  But the reality for many, particularly the demographics most attracted to Brexit and Trump, has been the widespread elimination of domestic manufacturing industries, uncertainty about the jobs of today and the future, and the realisation that not all players are equal on the great field that is the globe. If you are interested in this, there are some really great pieces (paywalled, I am afraid) in the Financial Times here and the Times here. Donald Trump explicitly stated this in his just-delivered speech when he said: \\\"Our country lost its way when we stopped putting the American people first. We got here because we switched from a policy of Americanism - focusing on what's good for America's middle class - to a policy of globalism.\\\" Full transcript here. He dedicated most of his comments to \\\"pathetic liar\\\" Hillary Clinton, claiming she needs to go to prison, would be blackmailed by the Chinese etc etc. Also fascinating, he appealed directly to Bernie Sanders' \\\"anti-Establishment\\\" voters.  The campaign of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has been the target of Russian hackers. Credit: AP 4. Abbott wants back in cabinet Tony Abbott has finally confirmed the worst-kept secret of the federal election campaign of 2016: he wants back in cabinet and possibly the Defence gig held by Marise Payne, a NSW moderate Liberal senator. Abbott spoke on Sky with Andrew Bolt, who he praised to the hilt beforehand in a rather awkward kind of sounding (and looking) Facebook video he posted on his page.  Worth reading his comments, which will be carefully noted internally as there was a whole load in there about gay marriage and his new hardline stance on Muslims. My report here. Regarding gay marriage, opponents are getting worried Malcolm Turnbull might be able to bring on a vote in Parliament if the Senate rejects plebiscite bills. Fresh positioning from the right on this is canvassed in this report in the Financial Review. In other news: Treasury-commissioned analysis says the Coalition's corporate tax cut would deliver \\\"one of the largest pay-offs imaginable from a government decision,\\\" Jacob Greber reports. Labor will widen its scare campaign to claim students' vaccination records could end up in the hands of private companies.  A senior vet was expelled from her government role after she exposed the pain and suffering of the live cattle export trade, including animals coated in faeces and dying of heat exhaustion. Dr Lynn Simpson is now suing the Commonwealth. This report contains distressing images. 6. Deadly lightning strikes in India It is monsoon season in India and the annual storms are taking a heftier toll than normal with at least 79 dead from lightning strikes, most in the state of Bihar (incidentally, the state in which I was born). Bihar is one of India's poorest states and borders Nepal in the north-east of the country. Lightning strikes are a big killer in India.\"}"
