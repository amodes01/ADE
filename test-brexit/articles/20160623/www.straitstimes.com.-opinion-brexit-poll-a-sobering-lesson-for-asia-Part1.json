The EU used to be held up as a model as we in Asia watched it expand from six nations to 10, then 12 and eventually 28 member states. With the exception of Greenland, which opted out as a Danish colony three decades ago but remains subject to EU treaties, no one had ever thought of quitting the union.  South-east Asian integration, which started in 1967, began with five nations grouped as Asean. This became six when Brunei joined in 1984 and has now grown to 10 members. South Asia, meanwhile, tried its own version, Saarc, albeit with less success. Now, the EU does not look so much like a winner anymore. We have been made aware that there is no sure bet about the integration process being one-way.  How did Britain come to this pass? As long as it suited its purpose of ensuring that there was no concentration of power in Europe, say a Franco-German one, Britain went along with the widening of EU membership. Winston Churchill, the lionised wartime prime minister, even once called for a \\\"United States of Europe\\\". But now that it is obliged to accept immigrants from the other 27 members, including nations like Romania, it is clearly uneasy. The sauce that was good for the British goose wasn't good for the British gander.  There is a lesson here. As long as globalisation is about selling goods and products, no one complains too much, provided trade does not favour one party overwhelmingly. But once countries began to push for trade in services and free movement of labour, unease sets in. And Britain is a net importer of goods and a net exporter of services.  What the Brexit debate and vote has shown us is that we can never wish away primeval fears such as fear of being \\\"swamped by the other\\\". When you combine these with economic realities such as stagnant wages and fears of reduced social welfare, you get an incendiary mix.  The exact pace of globalisation is hard to map, but Bulgarians, Romanians, Mexicans and, not to forget, Pakistanis and Indians, are easy to identify as villains of the show.  To an extent, perhaps we in South-east Asia may have already tacitly acknowledged this reality - that some things just cannot be rushed. See how the language on an Asean Economic Community has changed.  Not too long ago, the pitch was about developing a single market and production base. These days, we seem happier with less-ambitious formulations such as striving for a \\\"highly integrated economy\\\".  One lesson for Asia is how politics let loose can be the bane of social integration, with the potential to harm social compacts built up over decades. Last week, Singapore's Home Affairs and Law Minister K. Shanmugam took note of the anti-Muslim rhetoric in some Western nations arising from this. \\\"In a multiracial country, there is political profit in dividing people, playing on race, religion, stoking up fears. It is really unacceptable and I think morally reprehensible,\\\" he said.  The other cautionary tale, especially for significant nations such as China, India, Japan and Indonesia, is to go easy on nationalism. In these days of fragmented loyalties, it may not be a bad thing to stress a national identity and character. But that's quite different from pushing an excessively nationalist agenda, which can be dangerous.  Just look at the domestic, nationalistic pressures China has to contend with over the South China Sea disputes, which threaten to harden China's\"}"
