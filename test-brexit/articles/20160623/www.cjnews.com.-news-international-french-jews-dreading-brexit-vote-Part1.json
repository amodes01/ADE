"{\"uid\": \"www.cjnews.com.-news-international-french-jews-dreading-brexit-vote\", \"text\": \"LONDON - Less than two years after he moved his family from Paris to London, David Herz is already feeling at home in the United Kingdom.  The co-founder of a communications agency, Herz is among thousands of French Jews who moved across the channel in recent years. He says he immigrated mostly for financial reasons and is enjoying the added benefit of having his teenage children study in English in a good school.  Herz, his wife and three kids are part of the vibrant congregation of the Liberal Jewish Synagogue, which recently added services in French led by a rabbi from Strasbourg. The school and the synagogue, he added, are the pillars of his social life in his adoptive country.  But like millions living in Britain, the Herzes are now unsure of their future on the island kingdom as it prepares to vote on a referendum on staying in or leaving the European Union - a decision that could have far-reaching consequences for Europeans living and working in England, and for British workers on the continent.  \\\"We are in limbo,\\\" Herz, 45, told JTA last month. \\\"No one, including the government, seems to know what it would mean for us if Britain leaves.\\\"  The June 23 vote on whether to \\\"Brexit\\\" or \\\"Bremain\\\" follows December's vote in Parliament to put the decision to a referendum.  Occurring amid a debate over the EU's authority over individual member states and their financial affairs, the Brexit issue is further complicated by growing tensions among lawmakers over foreign policy issues, including Turkey's strained relationship with the EU and the migrant crisis.  As in elsewhere in Europe, Britain's right-wing parties resent U.K. membership in the bloc. They say a Brexit would ensure Britain is not pressured into taking in some of the 1.8 million mostly Muslim migrants who entered Europe last year.  But Bremainers - including Prime Minister David Cameron, who agreed to a referendum to appease his Conservative Party's right-leaning bloc - warn it would disrupt Britain's economy and force millions of Britons living on the continent to return. The scenario triggered speculation that Britain might retaliate by sending millions of EU citizens living in the U.K. packing.  Despite Cameron's campaign against the Brexit - U.S. President Barack Obama controversially endorsed his position in a joint news conference last month with the British premier - polls suggest a 50-50 split.

Still, some commentators insist that the June 16 stabbing near Leeds in northern England may hurt the Brexit camp, causing voters to veer left.  British Jews are divided on the issue, according to Justin Cohen, news editor at London's Jewish News daily. But among Europeans living in Britain, including French-speaking Jews, Brexit is seen as a disruptive choice born out of fear and arrogance.  \\\"In France, we see fear taking the form of xenophobia, as a rising National Front party reaches new popularity,\\\" said the Herzes' rabbi, Rene Pfertzel, who came to Britain 15 years ago to study and ended up staying. \\\"In Britain, it assumes the form of Brexit isolationism. But it comes from the same source.\\\"  For French Jews, Britain is attractive because it has lower taxes than France, more employment opportunities and a large Jewish community of some 250,000 people - Western Europe's largest after France's own 500,000 Jews.
