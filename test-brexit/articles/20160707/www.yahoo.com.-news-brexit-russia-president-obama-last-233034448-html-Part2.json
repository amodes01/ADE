"{\"uid\": \"www.yahoo.com.-news-brexit-russia-president-obama-last-233034448-html\", \"text\": \"\\\"looks a bit funny,\\\" says Konstantin Sivkov, a Moscow military strategist who served in the Russian General Staff between 1993 and 2005. It's not just the size of the force that seems laughable to him. It's the premise that such a force is needed to defend the Baltics from a Russian attack. \\\"When it comes to the Baltics, we do not have the strength, the resources or the will to do anything there,\\\" he told me by phone from Moscow on Wednesday. \\\"We have nothing to gain in the Baltics.\\\"  The price of defending and subsidizing Crimea, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014, has already put enormous strain on the Russian budget, leading to deeply unpopular cutbacks in the pension system and other social services. The subsequent collapse in the price of oil, Russia's main export, has driven its economy deeper into a full blown crisis, which shows no sign of easing any time soon.  On top of that, parliamentary elections have been scheduled for the fall, and the last time such a vote took place, in the winter of 2011, mass street protests broke out in Moscow to call for the resignation of President Vladimir Putin. So what worries Russia most is not a foreign war with NATO, but a revolution right at home, especially if the U.S. and its allies attempt to exploit any cracks in the regime, says Sivkov. \\\"If they manage to twist Russia in the direction of social chaos, then NATO can achieve its aim of taking over Russia's nuclear arsenal.\\\"  This may sound like paranoia. But is it really much more paranoid than NATO's concerns about a Russian invasion? A lot of Western experts are not so sure. After studying the way that Russia has positioned its forces around the country, Michael Kofman, a military analyst in Washington, DC, concluded that if Moscow is getting ready for any kind of war near its territory, it would be another flare-up in Ukraine, not anywhere near the Baltics. \\\"Everything about Russia's force posture indicates a country ill-prepared for war with NATO,\\\" wrote Kofman, a fellow at the Wilson Center think tank.  However much it may wish to challenge NATO's military superiority, Russia does not have the money, the manpower or the technology to do that any time soon-at least not in the arena of conventional warfare. But to compensate for that weakness, Moscow has become more reliant than ever on its nuclear arsenal, says William Perry, who served as Secretary of Defense during the Clinton Administration. \\\"They have put heavy emphasis on their tactical nuclear weapons, both in terms of the deployment and in terms of their rhetoric,\\\" he says. \\\"Put those together, and I'd say that's a very dangerous situation.\\\"  And it's not one that NATO will resolve by stationing a few thousand more troops along its border with Russia. Going into the Warsaw summit, the White House seems to realize that, and it is trying to open the kind of dialogue with Russia that could avoid an escalation to nuclear threats-or worse. \\\"From NATO's perspective, the foundation of our relationship with Russia is a balance between strength and dialogue,\\\" says Doug Lute, the current U.S. ambassador to the alliance. The deployment of four more brigades in Eastern Europe will represent the strength in that equation, he told reporters in a conference call on Wednesday. \\\"But we will equally be open to dialogue with Russia.\\\"  How and when that dialogue develops will be another challenge for NATO to work out. Stoltenberg, the Secretary General, said on July 4 that the alliance has not been able to agree on the terms for a meeting with Russia, and\"}"
