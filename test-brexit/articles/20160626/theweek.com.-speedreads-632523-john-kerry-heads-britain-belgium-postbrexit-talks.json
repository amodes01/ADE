While in each city, Kerry will meet with top diplomats to address the implications of the Brexit vote and urge a careful approach to the extrication process. Kerry believes a smooth transition will help \\\"the marketplace understand there are ways to minimize disruption, there are ways to smartly move ahead in order to protect the values and interests that we share.\\\"  \\\"The most important thing,\\\" he said in Rome on Saturday, \\\"is that all of us, as leaders, work together to provide as much continuity, as much stability, as much certainty as possible.\\\"  Subscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.
