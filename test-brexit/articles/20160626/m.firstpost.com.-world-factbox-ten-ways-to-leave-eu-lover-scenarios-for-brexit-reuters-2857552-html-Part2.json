Advertisement  In theory, there could be an endless standoff, with Britain the sulky teenager at the table, poisoning the atmosphere next year as France and Germany run elections and the EU starts confrontational talks on a new 7-year budget. Something would have to give and some compromise would start to be worked out.  Advertisement  REALLY? COMPROMISE IS THE EU WAY; DON'T RULE THIS OUT  4. WE MEAN IT - OR MAYBE WE DIDN'T  Article 50 suggests a one-way exit, rather than a revolving door. EU officials insist that once triggered, a state cannot back out and stay. It is not entirely clear, however. Could a future British government conclude that the best settlement to divorce proceedings is just to stay married, if others agree?  Advertisement  REALLY? SEE SCENARIO 2, BUT WITH ADDED FADING OF MEMORIES  5. CAN WE JUST TWEAK THIS QUICKLY?  Some Brexit campaigners have suggested that the Leave vote simply serve as leverage to renegotiate better, semi-detached terms for Britain inside the EU which could be put to another referendum. EU leaders have ruled that out on the same grounds as above that \\\"cherry picking\\\" will spread and wreck the Union. Cameron's deal, to protect the City of London from the euro zone and curb EU immigration, has been killed by a clause that linked it to last week's referendum result. So any talks would start from a lower base and EU leaders would have to eat their words. But some kind of \\\"associate membership\\\" or \\\"special partnership\\\" has been around as an idea in Europe for a time.  Advertisement  REALLY? SEE 4, BUT NEVER SAY NEVER IN EURO-COMPROMISE LAND  6. LET'S JUST SLIP INTO SOMETHING MORE COMFORTABLE  Britain could try to join the European Economic Area or European Free Trade Association, joining the likes of Norway, Switzerland or Iceland in close partnerships with the EU. That could fly with the EU but British leaders would have to persuade Brexit voters to agree to the EU budget contributions and migrants that are accepted by some of those countries. It also would lack the kind of EU market access for services trade which is so important to Britain's big financial sector. A more tailor-made deal would bring things back to earlier scenarios.

One extreme view is that the fallout from Brexit in the EU might be so cataclysmic that Europeans would go back to the drawing board and effectively create a new kind of Union that could include Britain. Marshalling disparate national ambitions into a new structure would be a colossal task, not least in the wake of the bitterness that the current crisis has engendered.  REALLY? A DEFINITE LONG SHOT, NOT ONE FOR THE NEAR FUTURE  8. SECOND TIME LUCKY?  Some people who voted to Leave have said that if it does not work outside, Britain could always join the EU again. That is true, though it would get no favours. It would face a years-long accession process and require unanimous acceptance by existing members and have to accept a host of conditions that Britain has opted out of during its past 43 years - notably adopting the euro and a virtually 50-percent rebate on EU membership fees.  REALLY? ONE FOR THE (VERY LONG-LIVED) BIRDS  9. ROOM FOR A LITTLE ONE?  Some Scots hope to avoid Brexit by breaking from England. An idea that an independent Scotland could somehow simply sit in the vacant UK chair in Brussels is dismissed by EU officials.  At the time of the 2014\"}"
