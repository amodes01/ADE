Republicans sounded the same notes, stressing their respect for the decision as well as the stability of the U.S.-UK relationship. House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, tweeted that \\\"the UK is an indispensable ally of the US, and that special relationship is unaffected by this vote.\\\"  Sen. Richard Burr, a the North Carolina Republican chairman of the Senate intelligence committee, said that \\\"while there will be a great deal of discussion in the coming days and weeks about what the 'Leave' win means for them and for us, our friends and allies in the UK should know this: we respect their decision, and we stand by them, just as they have always stood by us.\\\"  Others used the vote to make a point about domestic politics. Sen. Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican who casts himself as a political outsider intent on reforming a corrupt and moribund Washington, said the result should remind leaders in Washington and elsewhere that \\\"our citizens are dissatisfied with stagnant economies, declining wages, uncontrolled migration, rising crime, and terror attacks at home.\\\"  \\\"It's time to abandon the failed policies of the past and solve the real problems of the present,\\\" Cotton said. He added that the U.S. should now begin free-trade discussions with the UK, an issue that came up during Obama's April visit to London.  At the time, Obama had suggested that the UK would pay for a \\\"no\\\" vote economically, getting less preferential trade consideration, and that security ties might be affected as well.  \\\"I think it's fair to say that maybe some point down the line, there might be a UK-U.S. trade agreement, but it's not going to happen anytime soon, because our focus is in negotiating with a big bloc, the European Union, to get a trade agreement done,\\\" Obama said on April 22.  \\\"The UK is going to be in the back of the queue,\\\" the President added, \\\"not because we do not have a special relationship, but because, given the heavy lift on any trade agreement, us having access to a big market with a lot of countries - rather than trying to do piecemeal trade agreements - is hugely inefficient.\\\"  Trump seized on that to claim that Obama may have pushed voters to vote against staying in the EU, and knocked him for his comments that the UK would be at the back of the line.  \\\"A lot of people do not like him,\\\" Trump said of Obama. \\\"His recommendation perhaps caused it to fail.\\\"  Trump, who backed the \\\"leave\\\" campaign, said Friday that, \\\"I was actually very surprised that President Obama would have come over here and he would have been so bold as to tell the people over here what to do.\\\"  Trump also accused Clinton of opposing the Brexit \\\"because Obama wanted it\\\" and slammed his understanding of the public mood.  With Europe facing unprecedented terrorist attacks this year, Obama also touched in April on security, noting that global challenges require \\\"collective action,\\\" and that the vote's outcome \\\"is a matter of deep interest to the United States because it affects our prospects as well.\\\"  The U.S. \\\"wants a strong United Kingdom as a partner,\\\" he said, in part because of the leverage the UK can bring to bear inside the EU, with which the U.S. cooperates on a vast array of issues, from the Iran nuclear deal to climate change, Russia's aggression in Ukraine and stability in Asia.  \\\"The United Kingdom is at its best when it's helping to lead a strong Europe,\\\" Obama said during his London visit.
