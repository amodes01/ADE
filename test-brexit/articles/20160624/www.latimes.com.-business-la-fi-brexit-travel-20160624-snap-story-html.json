Demand for travel was already strong in the U.S., and the vote by the U.K. to leave the European Union will make it cheaper for Americans to visit their British cousins across the pond.  The exit of the United Kingdom from the 28-nation union has pushed the value of the British pound down relative to the U.S. dollar, making it likely that more U.S. travelers will visit Britain to take advantage of the disparity.  On Friday morning, the pound to dollar exchange dropped 7.44% to $1.3766, the lowest level in decades. Data from the metasearch travel site Liligo.com shows that searches from throughout the world for flights to Britain began to rise Thursday.

More than 117 million people traveled by air between the U.K. and the rest of the EU in 2015.

In the 12 months leading up to April, the number of visits to the U.K. was 5% higher than the same period a year earlier. The number of visitors who came from North America rose by 11% and jumped 4% from Europe, according to the Office of National Statistics in the U.K.  Meanwhile, the United Kingdom has been a huge source of tourism for the U.S.  The U.K. was the third largest source of international visitors to the U.S. in 2015, behind only Canada and Mexico, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce.  Last year, 4.9 million visitors traveled from the U.K. to the U.S., an 18% increase from the previous year. The only other countries with a bigger surge in visitors to the U.S. last year were South Korea, with a 20% increase, and China, with an 18.3% increase, Department of Commerce data show.
