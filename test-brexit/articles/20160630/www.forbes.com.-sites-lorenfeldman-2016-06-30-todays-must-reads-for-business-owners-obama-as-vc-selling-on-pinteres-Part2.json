Obama has both. He notched two presidential election wins in the face of steep odds, and passed health-care reform and other signature policy achievements despite fierce political resistance. Of course, he's no stranger to big losses. Obama admitted the party was 'shellacked' during the 2010 mid-term elections, and policy missteps have cost him dearly with Congress and overseas. But that should serve him well in an industry where 95% of start-ups fail to deliver their projected return on investment, and just a few big wins are the difference between wild success and total failure.\\\"  No one is talking about why the first investment of a city-backed venture capital fund in Philadelphia has failed: \\\"Besides the short-lived statement, the company has remained quiet. Josh Kopelman, whose First Round Capital was tapped to manage the city-backed fund, rolled out the boilerplate: 'While we hope that all of the companies in the StartUpPHL portfolio will succeed, we recognize that as an early stage investor, many will not,' Kopelman said via email. 'As a policy, we do not comment on company specific matters, and instead defer to the founder/CEO of the company to comment.'\\\"  Going Global  Trump and the Chamber of Commerce are fighting: \\\"The U.S. Chamber has been critical of Trump's trade and economic policies throughout the election and has offered pointed critiques of Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, as well. On Tuesday morning, before Trump took the stage at a raw aluminum producer outside of Pittsburgh, the Chamber published a post on its website that characterized the benefits of trade agreements as outweighing the drawbacks.\\\"  Could Britain be headed for a Brexit boom? \\\"A new paper by Raja Patnaik, a PhD candidate in finance at the London Business School, looked at how U.S. companies reacted to unpredictable weather around El Nino cycles. Mr. Patnaik found that in highly competitive industries businesses, on average, increase spending in the face of higher uncertainty. This is true particularly when businesses have a high degree of operational flexibility-that is, the ability to lay off workers in the event that demand collapses-and for more labor intensive businesses. Imagine that weather forecasters are in conflict about what the future holds. Some say a blizzard will hit your town, others say the storm will pass to your north. If you run a shop that sells snow shovels, you have the choice to order more from the town's shovel factory now or wait until you get more certainty about the weather. If you are the only shop in town selling shovels, you can afford to wait. If there are several other shovel shops, however, by holding off you risk having to stock up during a potential run on shovels. So you have an incentive to buy now. That's expansionary uncertainty at work.\\\"  Human Resources  A new state law in Ohio has blocked Cleveland from requiring contractors to hire local workers: \\\"In an interview, Mr. Jackson expressed dismay at a new state labor law, signed on May 30 by the Republican governor, John Kasich, that nullifies a 12-year city ordinance directing contractors working on most city projects to hire Cleveland residents for 20 percent of their labor force. The Ohio Contractors Association and the Republican-controlled legislature asserted that such local quotas, which also were in effect in Akron, made it\"}"
