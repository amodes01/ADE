Sooner or later things are going to change in Northern Ireland, probably on the constitutional question, but right now the work is about building bridges between the two communities, and this does not necessarily advance that,\\\" he said.    However, Morrison, who has Irish ancestry and earlier this year received a peace building award from the Irish president, refused to be pessimistic. \\\"I think the doomsayers about the peace process are undervaluing the amount of progress that has been made, and I do not think the politicians in the north are just going to lightly throw it away, although there will probably be debates that will be more contentious than they might have been in other circumstances.\\\"  Brexit was firmly opposed by former senator George Mitchell, who as US special envoy chaired the negotiations that led to the 1998 peace deal. Speaking at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington in April, he said a UK departure from the EU would be \\\"harmful\\\" to Northern Ireland.  Among the reasons he gave was the high probability of another Scottish referendum for independence. \\\"To me, I am not from Northern Ireland, but knowing the people there well, and knowing many people in Scotland, to think that Northern Ireland and Scotland would be in different countries is simply so inconsistent with their whole history which continues to this day,\\\" Mitchell said.

Brendan Boyle, a Democratic congressman from Pennsylvania, described the Good Friday agreement as \\\"one of the main foreign policy achievements in the world in my lifetime\\\" and suggested that the US might intervene to protect it.  \\\"Nearly 20 years after a hard border coming down, and great integration between the northern six counties and the 26 countries that make up the Irish Republic, to all of a sudden return to a hard border would simply be intolerable and a giant step backwards,\\\" said Boyle, whose father was born and raised in County Donegal. \\\"That would be backsliding and that would be retreating from the Good Friday agreement.  \\\"As the United States is one of the guarantors of the Good Friday agreement, I do not believe we can in any way allow that to move forward. As the Good Friday agreement shows, the United States has enormous diplomatic, economic and other tools that can be used in a positive and constructive way and I think this is another occasion on which they may be needed.\\\"  But Mick Mulvaney, a Republican from South Carolina, took a different view. \\\"Ultimately this is going to be\"}"
