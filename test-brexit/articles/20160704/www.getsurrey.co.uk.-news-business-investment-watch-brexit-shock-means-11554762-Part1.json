Perhaps it is this factor that maintains the appetite and intrigue of investors and traders, hungry to exploit price weakness and differentials in search of opportunities and ultimately profits.  I (along with most investment managers in the country) was genuinely dumbfounded that Brexit has indeed become a reality. There is little point now questioning the result - it is done. The country has to accept it and be only unified in attitude that a better, stronger Britain can result outside of the Brussels club.  I do believe it is fair to say that it will take time and there will be pain (in some quarters) that presents en route. Negotiations with our European neighbours have already commenced and securing trade deals will be top of the list. I (like all) will assume - hope is a better word - these discussions will result in favourable terms. And that will be just the start.  The market duly reacted negatively on Friday 24th June; I understand some hedge funds have been wiped out on the back of the aggressive downside initially experienced.  Large price falls  Having rallied significantly into the vote, the stage had been set for large price falls in the event of a Brexit materialising. The sectors most vulnerable to the economic risk and uncertainty now upon us have predictably taken a pasting. Here I refer to Banks and Property companies primarily but airlines have also been hammered with retailers close behind. Swift profit alerts have already been issued from both IAG and Easyjet and this has made for sobering viewing for many (including me).  Notwithstanding the heavy downside seen in some sectors, others having rallied strongly which has been a hugely pleasant surprise. The net effect of these movements has resulted in the FTSE 100 index currently residing higher now than it was pre Brexit which is incredible if believable.  Large cap companies that earn high proportions of their profits in dollars have risen as a result of the weakened pound. Pharmaceutical and oil companies predominantly should see beneficial effects to earnings due to this foreign exchange translation (assuming of course these FX rates prevail going forward).  Diversified equity portfolios have thus performed resiliently through what has been flagged up to be a potentially disastrous outcome by many. However one needs to understand that around 70% of the profits earned by FTSE 100 companies come from overseas which has actually revealed the FTSE 100 holistically to be somewhat of a Brexit hedge.

Remember, today's frenzied levels are exactly that and markets could look a whole lot different tomorrow. There are obviously other macroeconomic forces at work beyond our current selfish fixation with Brexit which continue to pose risk for investors. Attention should not be turned away (for example) from consideration of the health of the US and Chinese economies.  Brexit is not (yet at least) a Lehman Brothers event nor is it global as the 2008/9 systemic credit crisis was. Yes there are now\"}"
