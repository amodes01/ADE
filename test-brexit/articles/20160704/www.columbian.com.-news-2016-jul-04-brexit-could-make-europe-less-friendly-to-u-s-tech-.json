"{\"uid\": \"www.columbian.com.-news-2016-jul-04-brexit-could-make-europe-less-friendly-to-u-s-tech-\", \"text\": \"SAN FRANCISCO - Silicon Valley's biggest businesses could face tougher regulations following Britain's decision to withdraw from the European Union, and some might have to leave London to attract the best employees.  Many U.S. tech companies now count on Europe for a quarter or more of their business. Beyond facing a financial downturn as the pound's value erodes, these companies might find Europe a more challenging environment in which to do business.  It could take a year or two before the picture becomes clear. For now, what's certain is the U.K.'s exit will be complex and unprecedented, with repercussions crossing the Atlantic and reaching all the way to the U.S. West Coast.  Meanwhile, U.K. tech companies might have to leave the country to follow their customers and funding sources.\"}"
