[one_half][highlight]On the radio\\u2026[/highlight]  [/one_half]  But what did the June 23 vote mean for businesses here in San Diego? So far, the keyword for Brexit fallout is uncertainty.  The economies of the United Kingdom and San Diego touch in two primary ways: We sell them stuff we make through exports, and they hire people here through direct investment.  By Friday, the British pound had fallen about 10 percent - its value going from almost $1.50 to about $1.33.  That matters because a more expensive dollar means British money does not go as far.  That's the risk for local exporters: Their products got more expensive overnight. And deeper problems could await the British economy.  \\\"There is a real risk of recession in the U.K. economy,\\\" said Allan Timmermann, a UC San Diego professor who got his doctorate at the University of Cambridge and his master's at the London School of Economics.  How big is San Diego's trade with the United Kingdom? Depends whom you ask.  \\\"The number of companies that are trading with San Diego and the U.K. is really small compared to the overall number of companies that are trading with Mexico and Canada and China,\\\" said Victor Castillo, director of the Center for International Trade Development at Southwestern College. The center provides small businesses with training and technical assistance in international trade.  The center analyzed roughly 1,300 companies in San Diego engaged in international trade. Of those, about 130 companies traded with the European Union and only 16 specifically with the United Kingdom.

They are one of the largest San Diego exporters to the U.K. and employ 1,500 to 2,000 people locally.  Jay Thomas, executive vice president and chief financial officer of Cubic, said the company is not too worried because it mostly exports services rather than goods.  \\\"We run the subway, the fare collection part, and we train their army,\\\" Thomas said. \\\"Last I checked, they will not stop running the subway.\\\"  Cubic does about 20 percent of its business in the U.K. and employs 1,000 people, he said.  A 2015 joint report from the research group Brookings Institute and JPMorgan Chase actually suggested the U.K. was a key market for local service exports. The report also placed the U.K. as the sixth largest export market for San Diego.  Another way to measure trade is the value of goods that left San Diego's ports - ocean and air - to other countries. Last year, $22.7 billion worth of stuff headed out from here to places all over the world. Only $82.3 million of that went to the U.K., based on data from the U.S. Census Bureau.  Castillo said the impact on trade to San Diego businesses might be limited to a few industries, such as biotech and maritime technology. That trade is important, he said, but that's not his biggest concern.  \\\"I will be more worried about the decrease in foreign direct investment (from) the U.K. into San Diego,\\\" he said.
