"{\"uid\": \"freebeacon.com.-issues-brexit-proponents-critics-spar-debate-ahead-eu-referendum-\", \"text\": \"Brexit has become a contentious subject of discussion on the international stage, with Obama warning Britain against leaving the EU in April and British Conservatives rebuking him for doing so.  Obama alleged that it could take as much as a decade to negotiate a trade deal with the U.K. if Britain leaves the EU, which 'Remain' campaign advocates seized on during Tuesday's debate as a reason for staying in the union.  \\\"We go to the back of the queue. That's not what we said \\u2026 that's what Obama said,\\\" Davidson remarked.  Chris Grayling, the leader of the British House of Commons, accused Obama of playing politics during remarks on Capitol Hill last month and recommended that American politicians stay out of the debate. Johnson has also lambasted Obama for advocating for Britain to remain in a \\\"deeply anti-democratic\\\" union.  A dozen members of the House and Senate, including Rep. Mac Thornberry (R., Texas) and Sen. Ted Cruz (R., Texas), have written Obama in recent days, pleading him to remain neutral in the days ahead of the referendum.  \\\"Regardless of the outcome of the referendum, citizen of the United Kingdom should know that we will continue to regard our relations with the United Kingdom as a central factor in the foreign, security, and trading policies of the United States,\\\" they wrote.\"}"
