The top four country sources of immigrants into Switzerland are Germany, Italy, Portugal and France; the top four for Norway are Poland, Sweden, Lithuania and Germany; the top four for the UK are India, Poland, Pakistan and Ireland.  Michael Gove has pointed to the Albania-Ukraine model as the way forward. Putting aside that Albania accounts for 0.1 per cent of European trade and half the population live below the global poverty line of $5 per day, Michael Gove clearly does not understand the Stabilisation and Association Agreements in the Western Balkans. These arrangements were designed as support at the start of a journey towards EU membership and integration for relatively small, troubled economies, rather than a separation settlement for a big, successful one. Olli Rehn, who negotiated such pacts as EU enlargement commissioner, said he was \\\"surprised\\\" the Leave side would want an agreement that would put the UK \\\"permanently on the substitutes bench\\\".  Boris Johnson has a vision of the UK undertaking trade negotiations with every country and regional organisation in the world from scratch. EU trade agreements apply in the territory of its member states but if we leave the EU, we will no longer benefit from those agreements, including the 22 the EU has made with the UK's Commonwealth partners. We would no longer be covered by the negotiations with the US, Japan and other leaders in world trade now heading towards conclusion. Boris Johnson argues that the UK could quickly negotiate its own set of trade agreements to compensate. I defer to the view of Peter Sutherland, first Director General of the World Trade Organisation: \\\"This, judging from my long experience of trade negotiations, is highly unlikely. The trends are towards bloc-to-bloc negotiations. The US has confirmed that it would prefer to negotiate with the EU (with the UK in the EU, by the way).  \\\"The last in this catalogue of claims is that, if all else failed, the UK could rapidly negotiate its own trade agreement with the EU and somehow thereby replicate all the benefits of the single market. This would include \\\"passporting\\\" in financial services - the system, crucial to the City of London, by which a company based in one-member state can trade throughout the single market. Never mind that even the recently agreed EU-Canada trade deal, the most comprehensive the union has ever agreed (and seven years in the making), does not give the Canadians passporting rights. And all of this, the Leavers claim, without having to contribute anything to the EU budget or accept free movement of people.\\\"  Clarkson and Cameron on Brexit  In short, the Leave campaign has provided no substance as to how, or indeed why, \\\"we need to control our borders\\\" and has completely failed to explain how the economic consequences of border control will be managed.  The Leave campaign arguments for regaining our \\\"sovereignty\\\" are equally without substance. The idea that we should take greater control of our own destiny is a powerful one. I was expecting to be told what EU laws they would repeal or, better still, what laws the EU has inflicted on us against our will. I would expect them to be advising what EU laws we can ignore or disobey if we want to trade with the 27 EU countries. Not a word. So I went\"}"
