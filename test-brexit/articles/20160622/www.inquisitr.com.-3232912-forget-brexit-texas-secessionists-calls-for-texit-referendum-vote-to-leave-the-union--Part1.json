Daniel Miller hopes the secessionist Brexit movement will motivate citizens of Texas to call for their own Texit referendum to peacefully leave the union and establish their own independent country, reports the Guardian.  \\\"There are a lot of people asking, if Brexit why not Texit?\\\"  Miller points to the failed Scottish Independence vote in 2014 and the upcoming Brexit vote this week to say the secessionist movement is sweeping the Western world, according to the Guardian.  \\\"[This] only helps our case because there is a concrete first world example of a modern democracy having a legitimate and public debate where the people of a country, not the political class, get to vote on how they govern themselves and that will resonate not just through Europe but here as well.\\\"  The Brexit secessionist movement is fueled by the idea of independent determination with the knowledge people do not like to be governed by institutions that are far away and culturally different from their own.  The #Brexit vote is in less than 48 hours. ??

Those in the Remain camp, however, argue the open borders help improve trade, create jobs, and that leaving the EU would devastate Britain's economy.  Back in Texas, Miller argues the secessionist emotions boiling over in Britain and the desire to be free from the intervention of faraway governments is the same felt by Texans across the Lone Star State, reports the Guardian.  \\\"You could take 'Britain' out and replace it with 'Texas'. You could take 'EU' out and replace it with 'US'. You could take 'Brussels' out and replace it with 'Washington DC.\\\"  He's not alone in his desire to see a free and independent Texas, but the Texit movement to withdraw from the union has not been widely popular recently - it did not make it to the ballot or onto the Republican platform.  A group called the Republic of Texas believes the Lone Star State never surrendered its sovereignty to the United States when it became a state in 1845; they argue the U.S. illegally annexed the country, according to their website.  \\\"The great deception can be undone, stay tuned\\u2026\\\"  Can not wait for the #Texit Republic secession referendum.

Miller claims the Texas secessionist movement has 260,000 supporters and, in fact, soon after Barack Obama was re-elected as president, a Texit petition garnered more than 125,000 signatures.  The White House's response was simple: No.  The last leader of the modern-day Texas secession movement, Lance McLaren, was arrested after a standoff with federal authorities and is currently serving a 99-year jail term with a 2090 release date.  #Texit: #Brexit American Style - Why Texas Wants Independence From the United States https://t.co/LTrZtLePDu - Canary Trap (@canarytrap) June 22, 2016  Meanwhile, the Texas\"}"
