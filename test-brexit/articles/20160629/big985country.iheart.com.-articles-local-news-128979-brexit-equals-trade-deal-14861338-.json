I started this podcast 5 years ago to invite you into conversations and workshops that are designed to help make you happier, healthier and more healed. I believe that when you (yes you) feel seen, heard and understood you are able to deal with relationship struggles, work challenges and life's ups and downs with more ease and grace. I interview experts, celebrities, thought leaders and athletes so that we can grow our mindset, build better habits and uncover a side of them we have never seen before. New episodes every Monday and Friday. Your support means the world to me and I do not take it for granted - click the follow button and leave a review to help us spread the love with On Purpose. I can not wait for you to listen to your first or 500th episode!\"}"
