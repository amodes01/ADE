Back in March, in What would Brexit mean for wine lovers?, I set out what I thought might happen in the event that the UK referendum resulted in the UK voting to leave the European Union (EU). The conclusion I came to at that point was that nobody knows what will happen in the event of a Brexit, but it is likely that the price of wine from the EU would increase for UK wine lovers. Now that the Leave vote has won and the UK is set to exit the EU, my conclusion appears to be right.  As I write this article on the evening of Monday 27 June, nobody I have spoken to since the referendum knows what is going to happen. In the two days of trading since the referendum result, the financial markets have reacted in a way that, among other things, is likely to make EU wine significantly more expensive in the UK.  Whether you are popping champagne corks celebrating victory or drowning your sorrows in defeat, my guess is you are probably interested in how Brexit will affect the cost of your wine. So I will try to unpick what I can at this early stage.  Currency markets  The euro/sterling rate as markets closed on the day of the referendum was 0.77. As markets closed yesterday, Monday 27June, the rate was 0.83, so the pound has weakened by about 8%. This alone has increased the cost of EU wine in the UK by 8%.  I spoke to RBC Capital Markets to get their views on sterling's performance since the referendum. They see the current slump as relatively small compared with other historical slumps. 'During eight independent sterling price slumps we identify over the last 40 years, the pound has on average fallen 18% against the euro and 14% against the US dollar.'  So it may not be as bad as it could have been. However, a recovery does not look likely any time soon. RBC state that 'slumps have on average lasted 23 weeks before a material bounce, again suggesting markets do not move quickly to equilibrium and there is no reason to suppose this will be the case on this occasion either.'  In the light of last night's announcement by the ratings agency Standard & Poor's that they have downgraded the UK's credit rating from AAA to AA (negative outlook), stating that the referendum result could lead to a 'deterioration of the UK's economic performance', the value of the pound is likely to continue to fall in value, further pushing up the cost of EU wine for Brits.  The weakening in sterling will have been anticipated by many and a number of UK merchants I spoke to had hedged their position in advance of the referendum, but this is likely to soften the blow for only the first few months. If the pound continues to weaken, the reality will kick in once the biscuit tin is empty and the UK trade's pain will be shared with consumers. [See also this thread on our forum for the possible implications for importers of EU wine into the US - JR]  It's not just merchants and consumers who are feeling the bite. Winemakers need to make a living too. I spoke to Jane Eyre, a winemaker based in Burgundy, who has just started selling her wines into the UK in the last 12 months. She told me, 'Prices have been on the rise since 2012 and now we have the UK, a very important market for Burgundy, opting out of Europe. The crash of the pound puts my prices up instantly.'  The UK is a new market for Jane, but producers who have more established relationships with the UK market and are more reliant on it are likely to feel the pinch if their wines become\"}"
