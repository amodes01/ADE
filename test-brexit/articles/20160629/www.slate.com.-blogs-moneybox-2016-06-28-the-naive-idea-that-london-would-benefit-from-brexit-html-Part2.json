(The Economist derisively calls this rosy view the \\\"Singapore on steroids\\\" idea. Rather than imitate the success of the tiny polity that has become a global financial center in just 50 years, the magazine suggests that a solitary Britain would end up \\\"poorer, less open and less innovative \\u2026 less influential and more parochial.\\\")  Advertisement  Advertisement  What happens to universities after Brexit offers a good example of what cosmopolitan London prospering from EU remove might look like. Broadly speaking, as I wrote on Friday, higher education has been considered one of the EU's greatest success stories. The Erasmus program has allowed millions of young Europeans to study abroad and created a whole generation of (highly educated) Europeans with friends and memories across national borders. London, meanwhile, is one of the world capitals of international education. At London colleges and universities, 1 in 4 students are from outside the U.K. Under EU rules, students from the European Union are eligible for discounted tuition fees and a related student loan scheme that makes a British education much more affordable for them than for other international students, who might pay more than twice as much. At University College London, the 4,500 EU students make up the fastest-growing group in the student body. (About 1 in 5 UCL staff members are also EU nationals.) Brexit could jeopardize those connections.

Students and professors, wrote Jamie Martin, a former U.K. Department of Education official, \\\"should vote for a more open, innovative and internationalist future-and that means voting to Leave.\\\" More students from India, mainland China, the USA, Hong Kong, and Nigeria (paying more than their EU counterparts) would also constitute a \\\"windfall\\\" for the schools.  Advertisement  Advertisement  That vision represents, in microcosm, the post-Brexit London utopia, a city oriented less toward Europe and more toward the world at large.  It is also, as many, many observers have noted, a mirage. The dream of a London-friendly Brexit depends foremost on getting a sweetheart deal with the European Union on issues like \\\"passporting,\\\" the rules that allow EU financial institutions to be based in London, and most critics do not think the U.K. has the leverage to obtain a superior agreement. (Or as an EU diplomat put it on Monday, \\\"You cannot have your cake and eat it.\\\")  Advertisement  There is also the question of internal politics. As Anne Applebaum writes in the Washington Post, \\\"That elite version of Brexit-England as an offshore haven, a deregulated zone, an arcadian haven, a cosmopolitan business center, the Dubai of the North Atlantic-was not what the Daily Mail and the Daily Telegraph sold in the campaign, and it is not what the leave campaign put on their billboards.\\\"  The Leave campaign became increasingly tainted by xenophobia, while immigration remains the essential ingredient of London's success. The city is now 38 percent foreign-born, up from 15 percent in 1971. Last year, London surpassed its all-time population mark, set in 1939. But the native-born population is actually lower than it was in\"}"
