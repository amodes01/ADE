New stock listings in London are likely to all but cease while companies take stock of the damage.  Foreign banks may face the costs of moving thousands of employees out of London to the Continent so they can satisfy regulations governing trading and investment advice on behalf of European clients. London had provided a convenient hub to serve Europe.  James P. Gorman, the Morgan Stanley chief executive, and Colm Kelleher, the president, said Friday that they had no plans to relocate staff from London. But in a memo to employees - many of whom worked through the night to handle a huge trading volume - they said they might \\\"consider adjustments to our operating model.\\\"  Even Deutsche Bank, the symbol of German banking nominally based in Frankfurt, uses London as a base for investment banking and trading. It has often made most of its profit there.  \\\"I am afraid that this is not such a good day for Europe,\\\" said John Cryan, the Deutsche Bank chief, who happens to be British. \\\"At this stage, we cannot fully foresee the consequences, but there is no doubt that they will be negative on all sides.\\\"  Perhaps no company embodies the European project more than Airbus, a politically driven consortium that allowed Europe to remain a player in the aircraft industry after smaller national manufacturers could no longer compete. Airbus produces wings in Broughton and employs 15,000 people in Britain plus tens of thousands more at suppliers.  Outside the union, Britain may no longer have as strong a claim on those jobs. \\\"This is a lose-lose result for both Britain and Europe,\\\" said Thomas Enders, the Airbus chief executive. \\\"We will review our U.K. investment strategy, like everybody else will.\\\"  Other sectors as different as petrochemicals and Scottish whisky could be damaged by increases in customs duties, diverging legal requirements and slumping growth. Energy companies like BP or Royal Dutch Shell are worried about having to deal with an unwieldy snarl of differing regulations once the European Union umbrella is gone. \\\"Uncertainty is never helpful for a business such as ours,\\\" BP said in a statement Friday.  U.S. technology companies like Google and Facebook have sizable operations in Britain, though their headquarters are technically in low-tax countries like Ireland and the Netherlands. Google employs roughly 1,000 engineers across Britain, working on global products like its search engine and Android mobile operating system. Technology companies could be under pressure to move sales and marketing jobs from Britain, so these employees can still have access to Europe's common marketplace.  The ties are especially close between Britain and Germany, where the dismay was particularly pronounced. Britain imports more products from Germany than anywhere else. Britain is Germany's third-largest customer for exports, after the United States and France.  German brands like BMW, Mercedes and Volkswagen account for half the cars sold in Britain, according to the German Association of the Automobile Industry. Sales could suffer if Britain raises tariffs on imported vehicles. Shares of BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen plunged Friday.  German companies have helped keep alive manufacturing in Britain. Mini and Rolls-Royce are considered iconic British car brands, but both are owned by BMW. Bentley belongs to Volkswagen.  Probably the most important company in the renaissance of British car manufacturing has been Nissan, which has pumped close to 4 billion pounds since the mid-1980s into a\"}"
