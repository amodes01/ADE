"{\"uid\": \"www.theguardian.com.-us-news-2016-jun-25-donald-trump-nigel-farage-us-election-brexit\", \"text\": \"Britain voted on Thursday to leave the European Union, after a campaign characterized by fear of immigration, anger over a perceived undemocratic bureaucracy and trust in a charismatic political outsider.    If that sounds familiar, it's because it is. You can not fail to notice the parallels between Donald Trump's Latino-and-Muslim-free vision of America and the desire of Nigel Farage, driver if not leader of the \\\"Leave\\\" campaign, to cleanse the UK of Poles, refugees and anyone else who can not trace their British roots back to the bronze age.  The Brexit vote also revealed that the UK, like the US, is deeply divided. Sections of the voting population have drastically different opinions on the current state of their country and what its future should look like.  Trump v Farage  Jowls and loud-mouthed xenophobia aside, in appearance and lifestyle the two men do not have much in common.  Donald Trump is a fake-tanned, image-obsessed New Yorker who does not drink or smoke and has never had a cup of coffee. Nigel Farage is a pasty-skinned, British-toothed cigarette smoker who grew up in the rolling countryside of southern England and has built a political career around drinking beer.  In terms of background, however, the two have plenty in common. Blue collar they are not. Trump inherited his father's wildly successful housing business. Farage attended a fee-paying school - only 7% of Britons do so - before earning millions as a stockbroker.  Despite this, both have shown an uncanny ability to appeal to the working man - mostly by stoking fears about immigration. Trump thinks Mexico is sending rapists to the US. Farage has not been as clear about what he thinks the European Union is sending to the UK, but the fact he has been hawking a billboard showing a line of thousands of huddled, dark-skinned refugees offers a clue.

For Farage, substitute Washington with Brussels and China with Brussels and countries around the world with Brussels.  Mexican cooks v Polish plumbers  Every successfully intolerant campaign needs someone to demonise. The foreign worker who is coming over here and taking our jobs. The immigrant who is abusing the benefit system. The Black Lives Matter protester who's just been punched in the face at one of your rallies.  In America, the Mexican worker embodies everything the right perceives to be wrong with immigration policy. The Mexican worker has ruthlessly infiltrated the US with the specific intent of stealing low-paying, poorly regulated and undesirable jobs. Oh, and of abusing government benefits.  In the UK, this rallying figure is the Polish plumber, a man who has travelled from Warsaw to Wolverhampton with just one thing on his mind: fixing toilets. Toilets that a British plumber could be fixing. The Polish plumber also wants to abuse government benefits.  Two fingers (or one) to the establishment  In winning the Republican nomination, Trump beat out five current or former senators and nine current or former governors. In doing so, he defied opposition from the Republican National Committee and many serving congressmen and senators.  In the UK, the Leave campaign triumphed in the face of opposition from the leaders of every major political party and the vast majority of members of parliament.
