On Monday Danuta H\\u00fcbner, a Polish MEP who chairs the European Parliament's constitutional affairs committee, said English would cease to be an official language because each member country gets to choose one and Ireland had specified Gaelic. But the European Commission representation in Ireland quickly shot that down, saying a change to official EU languages requires unanimity from all members.

Five MEPs from the EPP group, including possible Parliament presidential candidate Mairead McGuinness and veteran MEP Elmar Brok, will go to the Hillary Clinton confab in Philadelphia. Also planning a trip to Philly are four Socialist members, including group leader Gianni Pittella, two MEPs from the Liberals, one Green and two members of the European Parliament secretariat.  JUNCKER'S KANYE MOMENT: Jean-Claude Juncker had a lot to say Tuesday, at Parliament, mingling with journalists, around the summit table, at the podium. Some of it sounded like this Kanye West rant: \\\"I have ideas that can make the human race existence within our 100 years better. Period.\\\" Here are some gems from the Commission president, defending his job:\"}"
