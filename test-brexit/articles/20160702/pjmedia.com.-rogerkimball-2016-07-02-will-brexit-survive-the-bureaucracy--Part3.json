We can not possibly entrust this process to the same civil servants that have been tangled up in this mess for the last 40 years.\\\"  William Cash, a eurosceptic MP who chairs a parliamentary committee monitoring the Brexit negotiations, was more upbeat. He acknowledged that \\\"a lot of people want to obstruct the democratic will of the British people,\\\" but concluded that \\\"the civil servants are duty-bound to carry out the will of Government.\\\"  \\\"We are assuming that leave means leave,\\\" Cash said, \\\"and expect whatever arrangements are made to be based on repealing the 1972 European Communities Act. Once repealed, that will carry away every treaty and every piece of European legislation that has ever been passed.\\\"  Advertisement  I hope he is right. Sir Humphrey was unavailable for comment.\"}"
