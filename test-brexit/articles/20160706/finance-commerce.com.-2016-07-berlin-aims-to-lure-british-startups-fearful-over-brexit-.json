As an anglophile she was saddened by the thought of Britain leaving the club.  Then Berlin's economy minister reached for the phone and got busy luring companies from Britain to the Germany capital.  \\\"The decision (to leave the EU), which I regret, was taken by Britain,\\\" Yzer told The Associated Press. \\\"So there can not be any surprise that those who see themselves firmly anchored inside the European Union \\u2026 now want to make sure that they are a home for businesses that say 'we need to be in.'\\\"  Yzer is not the only official on the continent hoping for a bonanza from Britain's exit, informally known as Brexit. Cities such as Frankfurt, Paris and Amsterdam have already been jostling to tempt banks away from London, Europe's biggest financial hub, with the promise of protecting their much-cherished access to the other 27 EU markets.  Berlin stands little chance of competing for a piece of the lucrative banking pie. But Yzer believes multinational companies - from airlines to pharma firms - will see the advantage of basing their European headquarters in the capital of the EU's biggest economy.  Its image as a relaxed and relatively affordable city may also convince tech companies, particularly startups, to relocate. Berlin is already home to online retailer Zalando, language-learning service babble and audio sharing platform SoundCloud.\"}"
