Frontman and BBC 6 Music presenter Huey Morgan addressed Scottish fans during a sun-blessed main stage set at T in the Park.  Introducing a song in Spanish, he said: \\\"I am speaking Spanish because you guys are Europeans, right?  \\\"I heard about that. Power to the people.\\\"  The statement triggered a huge cheer from the crowd.  The Fun Lovin' Criminals took to the main stage on Friday afternoon, ahead of headliners The Stone Roses.  They played an hour long set, packed with crowd pleasers from their 1996 debut album Come Find Yourself.\"}"
