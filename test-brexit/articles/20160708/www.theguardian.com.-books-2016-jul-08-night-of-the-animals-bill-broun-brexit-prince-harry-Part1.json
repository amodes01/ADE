It's the day after the Brexit vote, and it's not the standard first-time novelist jitters that have him rattled. As his publisher is happy to point out, Brexit is a turn of events foretold by his expansive dystopian novel, set in London in 2052. I am weirded out too, I tell him. The experience of reading his novel so soon after the vote felt a little unnerving.  In Night of the Animals, a British surveillance state is led by an alternate-universe Prince Harry. He has broken the electoral system, elevated the monarchy and doubled down on existing class divisions. In this nightmarish neoliberal dystopia, access to the NHS is granted according to class, and Britain's welfare state has disappeared under the \\\"Barenotecy Alimentation Act of 2025 and Positive Disenfranchisement Act of 2028\\\". People classified as \\\"indigent\\\" are kept away from the so-called \\\"new aristocracy\\\" by the Red Watch, a policing force armed with deadly \\\"neuralpikes\\\". Meanwhile, the vanishing middle class has been subdued \\\"with purchases of chocolate and lager\\\", as well as \\\"jingoism, and an abiding unctuousness toward the rich\\\".  The middle class has been subdued with 'chocolate and lager'  In case that does not make it clear enough, the world Broun imagines in his extraordinary debut is plagued by social and economic inequality. The novel's main character, Cuthbert, is an indigent, mentally ill drug addict. (The tipple of choice in Broun's world is a hallucinogen called Fl\\u014dt.) Cuthbert perambulates London from his grim little council flat to the offices of his physician Dr Bajwa, a harried, kindly man who just wants to keep Cuthbert out of the clutches of Equipoise, the NHS's sinister \\\"psychotherapeutic division\\\". As a giant comet approaches Earth during a moment of mass insecurity, suicide cults have taken hold worldwide. Cuthbert begins to hear the voices of animals in the London zoo, urging him to let them free; if Equipoise discovers his hallucinations, they will inevitably subdue Cuthbert inside a personality-killing \\\"Nexar hood\\\".  This, Broun worries, may be the society of the future. \\\"The Brexit is the kind of trigger that down the road can lead to the horror of a Night of the Animals world,\\\" he says.  Broun calls his book a \\\"British novel with American DNA\\\". He cites Zadie Smith, Ali Smith and Monica Ali as his favorite contemporary British writers, and says he wanted to work against what he sees as a \\\"narrow-minded and London-centric\\\" mode in British letters. His own connection to Britain is personal and complicated. His father is a retired British machinist who married an American nurse. Broun grew up in the US, but lived in London as a young man while he attended University College London. He remembers London as an exciting place, but a \\\"a very cold\\\" one. Although the novel is fanciful (if partly prophetic), it has its roots in Broun's personal experiences. Broun was aware of a \\\"dark class consciousness at a pretty young age\\\".

He says that he feels the trouble between them was connected to national differences too. His father was an emotionally distant Ameriphobe, making sure his American-living son grew up with the BBC world service, Aston Villa and giant boxes of British candy.  Ultimately, though,\"}"
