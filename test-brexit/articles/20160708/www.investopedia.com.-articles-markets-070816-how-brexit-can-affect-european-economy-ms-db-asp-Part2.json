As of October 2024, the dollar was sitting at around 1.30 to one pound. This is down from 1.68 in May 2014 and 1.40 in March 2018. This trend is indicative of deteriorating economic conditions in the United Kingdom, mainly from Brexit, combined with an improving U.S. economy.  In September 2022, the GBP fell to about $1.03 USD, marking the lowest price for the pound against the U.S. dollar in over 30 years.    It's also worth considering that many more dollars are in circulation than pounds. As of April 2024, $2.348 trillion U.S. dollars were in circulation. By contrast, the total pounds in circulation come to a mere \\u00a3 81 billion. To draw an analogy, the 2020 market capitalization of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.A, BRK.B) was much lower than that of Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) despite the fact that Berkshire Hathaway's share price is much higher. This is because there are many more outstanding Microsoft shares than Berkshire Hathaway shares.  Consequences of Brexit  On June 23, 2016, British citizens went to the polls and voted in favor of a referendum to leave the EU, of which the country had been a member since 1973. The Brexit, or British exit, came about as a result of a populist movement that had grown weary of ceding control of laws and regulations to outside forces in Brussels. There was also a fear of the effects of what was viewed as unchecked immigration. Economists, most of whom were confident that Britain would vote to remain in the EU, warned of economic consequences that would result from Brexit.  The vote in favor of Brexit shocked oddsmakers and roiled world markets. It also had an immediate and pronounced effect on the British pound, which declined in value by more than 8% in the 24 hours following the vote. This is another example of relative value trumping nominal value. While the pound remained stronger than the dollar in nominal terms, investors still abandoned the currency, citing its precipitous decline in relative value.  The pound has been turbulent and volatile since the 2016 Brexit announcement. Near the end of 2016, the GBP/USD reached lows of around 1.20. There was a slight rebound in 2018, peaking at around 1.40 in April of that year. Most recently, the sterling was trading roughly 1.2588 against the buck, owing to concerns over global growth, the risks of a U.K. recession, and interest rate differentials vastly in favor of the USD. Market speculators may very well make a test of parity (1 GBP to 1 USD) and even lower, potentially giving the USD a nominal value above the GBP.  Why Has the British Pound (GBP) Maintained a Nominal Premium to the U.S. Dollar (USD) for All These Years? Much of it has to do with the starting point of GBP/USD more than a century ago. The sterling has been in a long downward slide against the greenback for many decades, owing to the USD's rise to prominence, the growth of its economy, and GBP negatives, such as Brexit and a widening interest rate gap against the sterling, to name a few current factors. The nominal premium is not carved in stone, and speculative and macroeconomic developments may soon see the pound give up its nominal premium.  Does It Matter If GBP/USD Falls Below Parity? It would certainly be a blow to the United Kingdom's ego, but it will not make a significant change to global currency valuations. A weaker pound is a double-edged sword for the U.K.: A weaker currency is good for exports, which can bolster the economy, but a weak currency is also a driver of inflation (imports are more expensive), which the Bank of England\"}"
