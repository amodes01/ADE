Greg Abbott is not on board with a \\\"Texit,\\\" but is seizing a chance to take advantage of Brexit. Abbott announced Saturday the state will run digital ads on British websites over the July 4th weekend urging companies to \\\"declare independence from high taxes\\\" and relocate to Texas, reports the AP .  The campaign follows Britain's vote to leave the European Union and is funded through Texas One, the state's quasi-governmental marketing arm. Abbott spokesman John Wittman said he did not have specifics on how much the ads cost. The British vote reinvigorated Texas secessionist groups that in May nearly forced a floor vote on its fringe cause at the state Republican convention. But although Abbott has long accused the Obama administration of impeding on state sovereignty, the governor says Texas is not going anywhere. (More Brexit stories.)\"}"
