And I thought, merde!\\\"  How many times have I heard this in the past week? The news plunged many French people into a state of stupor and \\\"profound sadness\\\" - as President Fran\\u00e7ois Hollande commented the morning after the vote. There had been a death in the European family.  We did not have time to grieve for very long though. Brexit had an instant effect: the genie was out of the bottle. The French extreme-right leader Marine Le Pen held a press conference and chose the union jack to illustrate her Twitter account alongside the word Brexit. I have never seen her look so relaxed and happy. She beamed at the cameras, and lavished praise on the British people for standing up to the \\\"totalitarian EU, that prison of people\\\". Frexit is next, she roared. With a strong Channel wind in her sails, she has been on a roll ever since.  Last Wednesday she announced on French television that she'd call for the EU referendum immediately after being elected president next year. With Hollande and Nicolas Sarkozy wanting to run in the 2017 presidential elections, despite polls showing the French do not want to have anything to do with them ever again, she seems assured to get through to the second round.  There are facts we can no longer ignore. In the New York Times, Le Pen pointed out that in 2005 both France and the Netherlands had rejected the European constitution by referendum, and yet the European commission had chosen to ignore the people's will with the help or complicity of the French government - at its own peril, she added. The people's wrath has been mounting since then, and now \\\"the people's spring has begun\\\".  It is easy to dismiss her, but not so to be deaf to her arguments, some of them perfectly valid, and which seem to resonate loudly in many European ears. It is no surprise that her party has been on a steep rise for the last 10 years, gaining 28% of votes in the first round of the last local elections. And if, each time, France relies on a general republican elan to stop her, it does not resolve the core problem. As in Britain, both left and right parties have suffered Jacquerie-style revolts from the electorate. Brexit shows that no country is immune from this ever growing force, even a country like Britain, which we thought was devoid of political and ideological passion.  There are others in France who also rejoice at a Brexit but for fundamentally opposite reasons. \\\"This could be a new beginning for Europe,\\\" wrote columnist Jacques Julliard. The founding fathers of the union always envisaged an EU based on the principles of the welfare state, social justice and ever closer union. Former European commission president Jacques Delors thought that a common currency would naturally and organically foster a political union and fiscal harmonisation, but this was not to be.  Many in France point the finger at Britain, which, they argue, has hindered the natural European process for four decades by constantly opting out of measures it did not like, while pushing for neoliberal and austerity policies, thus creating a monster.  My local bookshop in Paris tells me that Victor Hugo's political speeches, notably those on Europe, have been selling very well since the UK referendum result. A coincidence, perhaps, but let us have a look. In 1869, with the authoritarian Napoleon III still in power, the exiled Hugo was more than ever clinging on to his European ideals. He addressed the peace congress in Lausanne with these words: \\\"Fellow citizens of the United States of\"}"
