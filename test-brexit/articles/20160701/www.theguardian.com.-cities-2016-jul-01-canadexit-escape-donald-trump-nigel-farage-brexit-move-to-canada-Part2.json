If you are married to or live with a Canadian citizen for a minimum of one year, they can sponsor you to become a permanent resident. In the era of the internet, seducing and then marrying a Canadian is easier than ever, and regardless of how unexceptional you were in your country of origin you will likely appear exotic to a Canadian. Act quickly, while your passport and currency still holds out some value to a potential partner.

Photograph: Gerry Deiter/AFP/Getty Images  For those without sexual capital, Canada offers an opaque, points-based visa system that takes into account language proficiency, education, skills and family ties, and which my Venezuelan Spanish teacher assures me is muy Kafkaesque. Quotas apply, the application process can take years, and the system is weighted heavily toward middle-class professionals. While UK citizens might reasonably assume that our shared aristocracy would give them an advantage here, this is not the case. They are in fact subject to the same eligibility criteria as Americans - all the more reason to get the applications in before Trump's thousand-year reich begins in November.  Those who do not manage to escape the UK and the US immediately should consider taking advantage of Canada's refugee asylum system. While more humane than Europe and Australia's strategy of hoping the boats sink in someone else's waters, it is by no means perfect. The application process for Syrian refugees, for example, is also weighted towards middle-class professionals. Unaccompanied males are excluded.  Should your application nevertheless be successful, you then need to decide where to settle. It's not an exaggeration to say that 98% of Canada is a frozen wasteland. Of the remaining 2%:  Vancouver  Canada's only beautiful city has already been rendered unaffordable by the same borderless capital flows whose panicked stampedes are about to devastate London. Suitable for aspirational fregan employees of weed dispensaries and 17-year-old Lamborghini-driving daughters of Chinese Communist Party officials.

Perfect for #NeverTrump Americans who like their hats big, their politics pro-life, and their carbon emissions uncapped and un-traded.  St John's  Newfoundland is the Ireland of Canada, and its capital's friendly and incomprehensible inhabitants make it a good place to wait out a civilisational collapse.  Montreal  Much like the EU, Canada has its own group of plucky and troublesome separatists, willing to cripple their economy in a quixotic defence of the specialness of their culture. Brits spoiling for a second Brexit, or those nostalgic for the experience of being sneered at by Parisians for trying to speak French and eager to recreate that experience in a colder climate, should consider making Montreal their home.  Ottawa  Canada's seat of government is everything you would expect of \\\"Canada's seat of government\\\". Ideal for those who enjoy sitting and governing.  Quebec City  Montreal with less culture or vice, Ville de Qu\\u00e9bec is the perfect place to resettle any elderly Francophile aunts.  Toronto  Canada's\"}"
