London Citizens, the London's branch of Citizens UK, organized Monday's coordinated demonstrations between 8 a.m. and 9 a.m. outside the tube and train stations across London. Charities, unions and schools are members of the coalition but majority of its members are Christian groups and churches including Black Majority Churches, Roman Catholics, Anglicans, Methodists, Salvation Army and Independent churches.  The demonstration's message \\\"Love London. No Place for Hate\\\" aims to curb the upsurge of hate crimes since the U.K. announced the EU Referendum result June 24. The members handed out stickers with love hearts, cards and instructions on how to report incidences of hate crime.  \\\"We are here to show that a tiny minority are not going to spoil it for everyone. London is diverse and we want to show love and hope for our community,\\\" curate at St. Paul's Shadwell, Rev. Alexandra Lilley, told Christianity Today.  Priest-in-charge at St. George-in-the-East, Canon Dr. Angus Ritchie, also urged individuals to report cases of hate crime to authorities.  \\\"London has a strong tradition of welcoming people from all backgrounds which we continue to champion,\\\" said Canon Ritchie on the coalition's website.  He added, \\\"As London Citizens we are clear that there is no justification for hate crime, and our members wish to show that love will always trump hate.\\\"  London's first elected Muslim mayor and also one with an ethnic minority background, Sadiq Khan, praised the group's effort. He also shared his aim to take a \\\"zero tolerance approach\\\" to hate crimes and stepped up efforts with the Met Police.  \\\"London does not just tolerate difference, it celebrates it,\\\" said Khan.  While Christian members of the coalition took it upon themselves to combat the xenophobic crimes, the dean of Exeter Cathedral, the Very Revd. Dr. Jonathan Draper, took it upon himself to apologize in behalf of majority Christians who voted overwhelmingly to leave the EU.  A poll result revealed that only 42 percent of Christians voted Remain in EU while 46 percent of Jewish voters and 70 percent of Hindu and Muslim voters supported the Remain campaign.  Revd. Draper tweeted, \\\"As a Christian I am embarrassed and apologise.\\\"\"}"
