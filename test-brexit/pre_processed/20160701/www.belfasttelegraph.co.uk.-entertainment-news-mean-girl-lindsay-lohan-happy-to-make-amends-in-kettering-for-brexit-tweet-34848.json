The American actress, 29, tweeted strong support for Britain to remain in the EU and lashed out at Leave politicians appearing on the BBC's overnight referendum programme.  She also angered some followers by singling out areas of the UK that voted for Leave for criticism, writing: \\\"Sorry #Kettering but where are you?\\\"  Lohan has now said she would be happy to visit the Northamptonshire town after Commons Leader Chris Grayling, who campaigned for Leave, backed calls for her to turn on the festive lights.  Tory backbencher Philip Hollobone had criticised Lohan for having \\\"slagged off\\\" parts of Britain which backed Brexit.  Speaking in the Commons, he singled out her \\\"fierce and offensive\\\" tweet directed at his Kettering constituency and asked Mr Grayling to support his invitation for Lohan to visit.  Tory frontbencher Mr Grayling joked in his reply: \\\"As those of us who have children will know, over the years Lindsay Lohan - as a star of child and teen movies, a very entertaining actress at the time - has not necessarily fulfilled her professional potential and perhaps now we know the reason why.  \\\"Had she visited Kettering she might have seen her career turn around and I think the invitation that you have made to her today is one she should accept, she should visit the fine town of Kettering and find herself returned to stardom.\\\"  Lohan replied on Twitter: \\\"Direct message me about your offer. Would be happy to light the Christmas tree in #Kettering.\\\"  A representative for Lohan has been contacted for comment.  Mr Hollobone said: \\\"She will get a fantastic reception if she comes. It sounds like she is a good sport. The local radio station are getting in touch with her because I do not tweet so we are hoping to hear back.\\\"  Asked if he thought the residents of Kettering might still be offended by her comments, he added: \\\"If she came she would make amends and all would be forgiven.\\\"\"}"
