"{\"uid\": \"www.theguardian.com.-us-news-2016-jul-01-bernie-sanders-voters-donald-trump-brexit\", \"text\": \"Earlier this year, the Guardian sought out Bernie Sanders supporters who said they would rather vote for Donald Trump than Hillary Clinton. Surveys at the time suggested a small proportion of Sanders fans, 7%, were willing to make such a switch.    We decided to go back to 150 of the 500 or so supporters who contacted us to see if Britain's decision to leave the European Union had made them more or less likely to favor the Republican Trump over the Democrat Clinton. Our thinking was that the economic and political turmoil caused by the success of a campaign based on nationalistic, anti-immigration sentiment led by a charismatic rightwing leader might have prompted some second thoughts.    Sanders penned an op-ed for the New York Times this week urging the Democrats to bring struggling working-class disaffected voters into the party fold rather than pushing them towards Trump. So what was this group of Sanders supporters thinking, post-Brexit?  About 50 responses were received. Some said they were no longer considering switching to Trump. About half backed Brexit, half opposed it.  Most of those who were still switching to Trump said they saw the Brexit result as vindication of their decision to back the Republican. Except in one case, those who opposed Brexit did not feel inspired to change their voting behavior in the wake of the UK's decision.  \\\"[The] outcome only concretes my vote for Trump, because I think in the long run it will do us good rather than harm, just like this Brexit vote,\\\" wrote Peter Kartachian, a 34-year-old machinist from California. \\\"These Chicken Littles who are claiming the world is ending because of this will soon be shown to be the empty suits that they are.\\\"  In at least two cases, Brexit has flipped previously unsure voters into the Trump column. One New York woman, Janet H, who asked for her surname not to be used as she did not want her family to know she is backing Trump, said she'd been leaning towards the Republican candidate until his racist comments about a judge of Mexican origin led her to switch, begrudgingly, to Clinton. \\\"Then Brexit happened,\\\" said Janet H. She continued:  As I was watching I felt a kinship with - and an admiration for - those in Britain who stood up to the taunting and shaming and voted to leave. They took their country back from Brussels and the elite establishment. Even now they are being shamed! But I was proud of them for going ahead. It made me think twice. I'd like to take my country back again too. I'd like to take it back from the elites and the establishment and the politically correct in my country ... But if I do decide to vote for Trump I will not tell anyone. I will let them think I am voting for Hillary.  Dan Lutts, a 70-year-old museum official, also said the UK's decision had pushed him more towards the Republican. \\\"I think the Brexit vote makes me more inclined to vote for Trump than to write in Sanders' name or vote for a third-party candidate. Maybe Trump would take us out of Nafta and actually kill the TPP [Trans-Pacific Partnership],\\\" he wrote.  Both a vote in favor of Brexit and a vote for Trump \\\"represent a rebellion against a political ideology and intellectual strait jacket that does not work\\\", said Colin Wright, a 58-year-old retiree from Hawaii. He added:  We - or at least I - will freely grant that Donald Trump on the one hand and Brexit on the other may not work either, but we have to try something, and just as in the US Hillary Clinton represents continuing along the same path that has so far yielded increasingly dismal results, so remaining\"}"
