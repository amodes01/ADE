In Belarus, authorities remained tight-lipped about Britain's choice.  But opposition leaders voiced concerns that Britain's exit will play into the hands of the Kremlin by temporarily paralyzing Europe and depriving it of one its most virulent critics of Russian President Vladimir Putin.  \\\"It's bad news for us,\\\" lamented Alyaksei Yanukevich, the head of the opposition Belarusian Popular Front. \\\"Over the next few years, Britain and other European countries will be very busy taking care of their internal affairs, they will be building a new architecture for Europe, and this means that outside the EU, most particularly in our region, the Kremlin will have more leeway.\\\"  In the other three Eastern Partnership countries - Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan - reaction to the Brexit vote was more serene.  \\\"In terms of possible political impact to Azerbaijan, the EU did not cooperate with us so closely, so I am not expecting any impact on bilateral relations,\\\" said Rasim Musabeyov, a lawmaker in Azerbaijan's Parliament.  Experts say the immediate fallout of the Brexit vote for Azerbaijan is mostly economic; the country's oil fund keeps 5 percent of its assets in Britain's currency - more than 1.1 billion British pounds.  In Georgia, Prime Minister Giorgi Kvirikashvili expressed his \\\"personal regret\\\" at the outcome of the British referendum but said he had \\\"no doubt\\\" the European Union will survive the blow.  \\\"This vote will not change the fact that the European Union is the most important and powerful regional political and economic union in the world,\\\" he said. \\\"Its strength will continue to grow.\\\"  RFE/RL's Ukrainian, Belarusian, Moldovan, Azerbaijani, and Georgian services contributed to this report.
