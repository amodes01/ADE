I hope we have knocked the first brick out of the wall,\\\" exulted Nigel Farage, leader of the U.K. Independence Party. He proposed June 23, the date the United Kingdom narrowly voted to leave the European Union, should be a new national holiday called Independence Day.  But Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling, who wanted Scotland to remain in the U.K. and the U.K. to remain in the EU, sadly tweeted: \\\"Scotland will seek independence now. Cameron's legacy will be breaking up two unions. Neither needed to happen.\\\"  Soon-to-be-former Prime Minister David Cameron's decision to hold a referendum on Britain's EU membership has assured the dismantling of the United Kingdom. In England, 58 per cent voted \\\"Leave,\\\" while 62 per cent of Scots voted \\\"Remain.\\\" It is \\\"democratically unacceptable\\\" for Scotland to be dragged out of the EU by the English, said First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, and a second independence referendum in Scotland is \\\"highly likely.\\\"  It remains to be seen whether Cameron's historic blunder will also trigger the disintegration of the EU itself, but there are plenty of right-wing nationalists in other EU countries who hope there will be a domino effect.  Marine Le Pen, leader of France's Front National, called the referendum \\\"a key moment in European history,\\\" and said, \\\"I hope the French also have a similar exercise.\\\" And a possible \\\"Frexit\\\" is just the start.  Geert Wilders, whose anti-Muslim, anti-immigration Freedom party is predicted to win 46 of the 150 seats in the Dutch parliament in next year's election, promised if he is elected, the Netherlands will hold its own \\\"Nexit\\\" referendum. Italy's anti-immigrant Northern League and the populist 5-Star Movement both called for a referendum on Italian membership of the EU.  Kristian Thulesen Dahls, the leader of the Danish People's Party, said Denmark should follow Britain's lead. Nationalist leaders in Eastern Europe such as Poland's Jaroslaw Kaczynski and Hungary's Viktor Orban indulge in harsh anti-EU rhetoric all the time. And so on.  But most of the people who might vote for these nationalist leaders are not seeking the destruction of the EU, just big changes in the way it works - in particular the reform or abolition of the euro currency and much stricter controls on immigration. Unlike the \\\"Little Englanders\\\" who voted for Brexit, they see the EU as an essential bulwark against a return to the old Europe of beggar-my-neighbour trade policies and savage wars.  The EU's leaders will have to take a very tough line in the negotiations about the EU's post-Brexit relations with the U.K. A horrible example will be required to show the nationalists and populists in other member states that leaving is hard and painful. And to preserve the EU, they will have to abolish or drastically restructure the euro (but that had become necessary anyway).  The odds are, however, the EU will survive. Its biggest problem will not be the loss of the U.K., its second-biggest economy, but rather the fact post-Brexit Germany will dominate the union even more than it does already.  As for the British, they have made their bed, and they will have to lie in it. The pound sterling has already lost much value and will probably lose much more. The last of the three major global ratings agencies, Standard and Poor's, will downgrade the U.K.'s AAA credit rating. Foreign investment will dry up in recognition of the\"}"
