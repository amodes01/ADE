But for young people who have only known the UK in the EU, it is meaningless. For them, the EU's open borders are a boon, not a bane: they can work and study anywhere in Europe. They see government policy, not immigration, as the primary cause of low wages and pressure on local services. And although they may be angry about tax, they see that too as primarily due to government policy, not the EU. Perhaps most fundamentally of all, they see themselves as British Europeans, not simply as British. Their anger is aimed much more at \\\"baby boomers\\\", whom they believe had security, prosperity and opportunity that is being denied to them. This is as distorted a view as that of the older people who say \\\"young people today\\\" are feckless, lazy and/or thick. But it reinforces the sense of alienation. And Brexit makes this much, much worse.  Older people voted for Brexit: the older they were, the more likely they were to vote to leave. Young people, especially those aged 18-25, voted overwhelmingly to remain in the EU. They are understandably furious with older people about the result. But in last year's General Election, only 43% of that age group bothered to vote, compared with 78% of over-65s. The same may well have been true in the referendum. My 18-year-old daughter (who did vote) complained that her friends would discuss the referendum on social media, but they would not vote. Young people feel disenfranchised, but their own behavior reinforces this. Brexit is to some extent a reflection of the disengagement of young people from the political process.  And it is also a reflection of the growing fragmentation of the UK. The BBC's map of England and Wales turned blue: but Scotland and Northern Ireland turned yellow. Scotland, in particular, voted overwhelmingly to remain in the EU. This will reinforce calls for a second independence referendum in Scotland. It may also reignite the campaign for reunification of Northern Ireland with its southern neighbor, Ireland, which has no plans to leave the EU.  Nor do the fault lines run only between the countries that make up the UK. England, by far the largest of the four, is also deeply split, with the industrial \\\"heartlands\\\" voting to Leave but London voting to Remain. This reflects long-term dissatisfaction with the direction of the UK economy. The UK is a service economy, and the cosmopolitan, services-dominated London is the heart of it. Heavy manufacturing industries and mining, especially in the Midlands and North of England, were systematically trashed in the 1980s and have never really recovered. Older people there, who remember the glory days of industrial strength and dream of its return, are angry at the success of the upstart London - especially as they believe they paid for its bailout in 2008. They see themselves as the \\\"real people\\\", and London as a \\\"bubble\\\" dominated by bankers and politicians.  London may respond to this antagonism in a way they do not expect. It is, after all, one of the biggest and most prosperous cities in the world, with a larger population than the whole of Scotland. There are already suggestions that if Scotland could go it alone, so too could London. \\\"The idea of London and Scotland becoming free trade zones has to be explored\\\", said Anthony Painter of the London-based Royal Society of Arts in a tweet. \\\"The UK is no longer a single political entity\\\".  Rather than \\\"getting their country back\\\", the victorious\"}"
