The topic was the future of NATO. My guests all spoke of their great admiration for the United States, even those who were troubled by the Obama administration's \\\"pivot\\\" to Asia. Ever briefly the talk was of Putin; then it gave way to my guests' strange cocktail of amusement and shock at Trump's unlikely ascent.  \\\"Americans will come to their senses,\\\" said one Asian ambassador, dressed perfectly, standing for our parting toast and echoing the fallacy that the pundit class has been bellowing all year: This absurd and insurgent Trump candidacy, surely, is one bad news cycle away from fatal. Many ambassadors also argued that the British people would see sense and stay in the EU.  Now, a new political reality unimaginable just months ago has set in overnight.  Britain voted to quit the EU, a seismic shift in geopolitical world order. Prime Minister David Cameron stood somberly the morning after to announce his departure by October.  The speculation is that the historic win, championed by non-establishment figures like Nigel Farage and the preternaturally colorful Boris Johnson, will presage a split of Scotland from Britain. Others fear the contagion of Euroscepticism could lead to other member nations severing themselves from the world's largest trading body. Maybe so. Party leaders in France, Italy and the Netherlands are wasting no time in capitalizing on this sea change to trigger similar \\\"Brexit\\\" style referendum movements in their own countries.  The enveloping irony around all of this, of course, is that Trump arrived in Scotland the day of the Brexit vote.  Trump is mired in the most turbulent period of his candidacy, his campaign sputtering, maybe run aground for good. Possibly, though, it has been revitalized by a reset of his campaign that started last weekend with the firing of his campaign manager, the pugnacious Corey Lewandowski, and culminated in Trump's brass-knuckles speech Wednesday that took aim not just at Hillary Clinton as a \\\"world class liar,\\\" but at corporate profiteering, Saudi Arabia and the Sultan of Brunei's treatment of women and the LGBT community, globalization itself-even the impish American spirit, sounding as close to Emersonian as Trump may ever possibly get.  For weeks, the London press has painted those in the Leave camp with Trumpian tones. You know the picture: working class, out-of-work disaffected men, embittered by a new world order that has seen London elect its first Muslim mayor (of all things!) and a country seemingly awash in Muslim immigrants. The Remain camp did its best to portray Leave Lilliputians as acting out their racist impulses.  It's true, Trump and the Leave campaign shared many common political themes. Leave unabashedly vowed to restore Britain's greatness and hit hard the sclerotic political establishment in Brussels. The leader of UKIP, Nigel Farage, decries the threat posed by Syrian immigrants, while Donald Trump talks about the threat posed by radical Islamic terrorism.  But if racism alone were the explanation for Trump's ascension and the rupture between Britain and the EU, how then to explain a brittle political order where multiple member countries are now openly discussing thoughts of their own break from Brussels?  \\\"I am actually an open borders kind of guy,\\\" said Kevin Hassett, a former economic adviser to President George W. Bush who was a vocal proponent of Leave. \\\"So what you want is for everyone to\"}"
