It can no longer hide behind EU statements for this and needs friends not enemies. Worse, it may even try to exploit any unhappiness with the EU or US. Above all there will be an obsession with obtaining new trade deals to replace those lost by exiting the EU.  For the crisis countries of Syria, Iraq, Yemen and Libya, Britain may offer little. Their urgent priority is solutions and creative thinking to usher them out of their disastrous plight. Any potential peace deals will require external assistance, and nation-building expertise. A navel-gazing inward-looking British government is not going to do that.  Turkey will lose a country that has until this Brexit campaign when the prime minister backed off, championed its accession to the EU. Britain will now have zero influence on this. Israel will lose a key voice within the EU for its interests, one that often inserted US positions into the Israel-Palestine debate in Brussels. As for Iran, an incoming British government may take a different approach to the nuclear issue.  Given the likely make-up of a pro-Brexit government is hardly going to be refugee-friendly, there will be little change on this issue. The UK had already left the refugee crisis to be managed (poorly) by the rest of the EU and will continue to wash its hands of any responsibility.  But where Britain has played a positive role is as a major aid donor. This is under threat. One of the grievances of the far right in Britain is that, rather than invest in core services at home, too much funding went on international development. Incoming ministers may wish to shrink the \\u00a312 billion aid budget especially if the economy dips into recession. Britain has committed \\u00a31.1 billion to Syria but this generosity as the second largest bilateral donor may diminish.  Another consequence of Brexit for the Middle East will be Britain's eventual absence from EU decision-making on the region. Britain has by far and away the most extensive diplomatic reach across the area, with deep historical ties. For sure, as the forthcoming Chilcot report into the 2003 Iraq will surely outline, British politicians have a very checkered record on the Middle East. But British diplomats are hugely respected across the EU. Frequently European diplomats tell me how much they value British input in Arab capitals.  What is so hard to determine and ultimately may matter most to the Middle East is just how influential Britain will be on the world stage, a stage that is fragmented and in the shadows. Much of this will depend on the leadership of future governments and the ability to shape a vibrant, outward-looking approach for a country that has just shown how inward looking it prefers to be.  - Chris Doyle is the director of Council for Arab-British Understanding.
