Advertisement  Advertisement  Advertisement  These guys are not Salafi. The idea that this is the Salafization of Islam does not make sense because their approach to salvation is not the Salafi approach. The Salafis do not believe in suicide. They think that suicide is a sin against God, like the Jews and the Christians. If you kill yourself or put yourself in a position where you will necessarily be killed, you preempt the will of God. But in the mind of the suicide bombers, the idea is that you do not need to be a good Muslim, you do not need to pray five times a day, you do not need to go for hajj. If you make a supreme sacrifice, you will go directly to paradise and there is no need to be strict believer.  Advertisement  If what you are saying is true, how do we stop these attacks? We often hear that the solution is to \\\"moderate\\\" Islam, but that would not seem to be the solution in the narrative you just laid out.  These guys are attracted by the narrative of Daesh. And Daesh today is the only international anti-society, anti-world order group. There is no more global international extreme left. If you take [left-wing parties] Podemos in Spain or Syriza in Greece, these movements are now anti-globalization. The only global movement now is radical Islam, which explains the number of converts-which is extraordinary. The number of converts who have joined the jihad is between 20 percent and 30 percent.  Advertisement  Advertisement  Advertisement  The issue now is to debunk the narrative of Daesh. We should penalize Daesh by not depicting it as the biggest threat to Western civilization-that condones their propaganda. The second point is that we should not allow radical Islam to have a monopoly on Islam. For that, we should let rise a normal Islam, not a moderate Islam. The concept of moderate Islam is totally misleading: You do not have moderate religion. Calvinism is not moderate. Calvin and Luther were not moderates. They were radicals. But you can have moderate believers who are not necessarily moderately believing. We should let normal Islam emerge as a religion in the public sphere. In the United States, this is easier because religion is accepted. But in Europe it is a problem. The trend in Europe is to consider any religion as a potential problem.  Advertisement  Advertisement  Is this why you think countries like France tend to have a bigger problem with radicalization than the United States?  Yes. Because the answer to radicalism in France is to marginalize religion more and more. It is to expel religion from the public space. And if you expel religion from the public space, then you give religion to the extremes and the radicals.  Advertisement  I am guessing you do not like Donald Trump's approach to Islam.  It is interesting because Trump is not a religious guy. His Islamophobia is linked with some sort of contempt of religion. That's the ambiguity of it. It is not a Christian Islamophobia. Trump does not pay lip service to religion when he attacks Islam. He does not say you can be a nice believer or anything like that. He rejects Islam as a rule and he never speaks about good religion, even Christianity.  Advertisement  We just had far-right forces in Austria get near a majority, and we have the Brexit vote this week-which has been driven in part by xenophobia. And there is always France. How optimistic are you about integration of Islam into European society and the politics around it?  I think there is a discontinuity between the realities in Europe and the perception. The crisis now is terrorism and refugees, and it is\"}"
