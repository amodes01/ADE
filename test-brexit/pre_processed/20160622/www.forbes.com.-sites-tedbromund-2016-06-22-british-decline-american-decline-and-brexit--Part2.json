"{\"uid\": \"www.forbes.com.-sites-tedbromund-2016-06-22-british-decline-american-decline-and-brexit-\", \"text\": \"calls for the U.S. to focus on domestic rebuilding (i.e., more domestic spending) have been echoed by current presidential candidates. The U.S. is showing some of the same centralizing trends that did Britain few favors in the post-war era - trends that, on the progressive side of politics, are accompanied by just the sort of critique of U.S. institutions that the U.K. experienced (find me, for example, a progressive who praises federalism or rejects government-run healthcare). In short, while I agree we are not the U.K., the comparison has its merits.  The EU is part centralizing hindrance, part distraction  And what of Brexit? One of the major arguments offered for British entry into the European Economic Community (as it then was), was that British industry needed the \\\"cold shower\\\" of greater competition to snap out of its tradition-induced torpor. This was nonsense: British industry (and British unions) had plenty of problems, but the answer wasn't the EU. It was better government policies. And today, while the U.K. - thanks in large part to the fact that it's kept the pound - still has a fair amount of freedom to make its own policies. EU membership is all about reducing that freedom. The EU today is partly a centralizing hindrance and partly, as it was in the 1960s, a distraction from focusing on substantive issues.  And besides, if anyone today needs a cold shower, as Pethokoukis's graphs imply, it's the continent. Britain and the U.S. could and should be doing better, but it's the EU that's really underperforming. Focusing on the EU as your best market is a bit like emphasizing selling into the British Empire in 1945: It's a declining, fissiparous market that still has imperial ambitions.  Britain suffered after World War II, in part, because it had had the Empire as a more or less captive market for too long. If what you want is more dynamism in your economy - and that's the ultimate answer to concerns about decline - the last thing you need, politically or economically, is more EU.\"}"
