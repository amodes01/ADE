But the fact that non-European union countries in the group of seats reserved for Western countries sometimes get elected, such as Australia and New Zealand, does \\\"demonstrates that the EU dimension can be overcome,\\\" he added. \\\"So in our case it was one of the reasons we lost, but I would not say it was the predominant one.\\\"  Another former diplomat who worked on the 2010 Security Council bid told HuffPost blaming the EU and African colonies for the loss mathematically \\\"does not even make a little bit of sense\\\" and is \\\"a lazy excuse.\\\"  Nobody knows for sure, and it's probably a combination of several different reasons, said the former official who agreed to speak anonymously so he could be candid.

Part of our strategy was to have him in New York meeting with ambassadors (who cast secret ballots) regularly, but he only came once or twice outside of the General Assembly's leaders week (when he met with ministers). He just refused to meet with ambassadors,\\\" the official said.  Obhrai and Peter Kent, the then minister of state of foreign affairs for the Americas, were used to help court ambassadors' support but they were not the minister of foreign affairs \\\"which makes a difference to a lot of countries,\\\" he added.  \\\"Combine that with our refusal to spend to fly diplomats in for junkets (which Portugal spent a fortune on), and we did not seem like we cared nearly as much.\\\"  Loss was a 'badge of honour': Baird  A year after the vote, then foreign affairs minister John Baird went on to describe the failed bid as a badge of honour.

But we did not and I do not think we regret anything. Iran probably voted against us; North Korea probably voted against us; Gadhafi probably voted against us. I think those are all badges of honour,\\\" he said.  Whatever the real reason for Canada's failed attempt at UN Security Council, Obhrai believes a weaker EU would benefit Canada.  \\\"They dominate everything. That is why if [Britain] leaves the European Union and the European Union is brought down in size, then we have direct relations with these countries in which we would benefit more because they would support us and they do not need to support the European Union,\\\" he said.  Canada would be \\\"better off\\\" engaging with European states one-on-one and strengthening already close ties, outside of the lens of the EU, Obhrai said.
