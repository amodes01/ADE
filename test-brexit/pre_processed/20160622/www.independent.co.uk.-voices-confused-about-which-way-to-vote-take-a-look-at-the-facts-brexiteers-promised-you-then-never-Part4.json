First, the most startling fact is that the House of Commons has undertaken a significant study on this but failed to (successfully at least) publish it. One has to resort to an independent and comprehensive report from the Centre for European Policy Studies to find the outcome of the House of Commons analysis: 6.8 per cent of primary UK legislation and 13.8 per cent of UK secondary legislation had a role in implementing EU law - 20.6 per cent of legislation in total compared to the 75 per cent that we hear from prominent Leave campaigners.  Turning to the content of these EU driven laws: how do they affect our lives and would we repeal them? Most of the areas where EU laws take precedence set the business norms and standards that all nations must observe in a global economy. Some establish levels of protection for workers; others, environmental controls. In short, most of these laws we should welcome or at least accept are necessary to trade in the Single Market. They will continue to apply if we leave and want to continue to trade with Europe. I was surprised recently when Sir James Dyson and Sir Anthony Bamford - both founders and leaders of extraordinarily successful global businesses - came out in favour of Brexit. Both believe they have axes to grind on EU laws. Dyson has failed in an EU legal challenge to competitor labelling practices; Bamford has lost a six-year battle against a \\u20ac39 million fine by the Commission for anti-trust breaches. Whatever the merits or not of their cases, these laws will not go away if we exit and still want to continue to trade with Europe.  On many other policies the UK has opted out - the euro, Schengen (open borders) and some elements of legal and judicial affairs, for example. And on the legislation that really affects our daily lives, for instance taxes, welfare, war and peace, and national security, policy has been set by Westminster politicians. We may agree or disagree with these laws but we cannot claim they are EU driven and that we have surrendered democracy or self-government.  It is also wrong to argue, as Nigel Farage does frequently, that EU laws are imposed by unelected bureaucrats in the European Commission. The commission only proposes draft legislation. It is then adopted by the Council of Ministers, consisting of elected national governments, and the elected European Parliament. The harsh reality - an irony here for the Brexiteers - is that the House of Commons is poor when it comes to overseeing our EU policies. The unelected House of Lords actually does a much better job, as do the national parliaments in Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands for example.  Finally, sovereignty of which nation are we demanding: England and Wales? Let us be absolutely clear - a vote to leave the EU will ultimately mean a vote for Scotland to leave the UK and hence the break-up of the UK as we know it today. Both Yes and No voters in the Scottish referendum favoured EU membership. A Brexit will trigger a new Scottish referendum. Imagine Anglo-Scottish border controls along the 100 miles between Berwick or Gretna. And imagine border controls between Ireland and Northern Ireland along the 500 miles between Lough Foyle and Carlingford Lough. This used to be one of the most politically contentious borders in the world with customs posts turned into military check points. Ireland did not sign up to Schengen, preferring instead to opt for its current passport free status (shared with the Channel Islands and Isle of Man) as part of the Common Travel Area. The Leave camp say that the border\"}"
