Between 2001 and 2011, the net fiscal contribution of recent arrivals from the eastern European countries that have joined the EU since 2004 has amounted to almost \\u00a35bn. Even during the worst years of the financial crisis, in 2007-11, they made a net contribution of almost \\u00a32bn to British public finances. Migrants from other European countries chipped in \\u00a38.6bn.  In short, most EU migrants come here to work and add value to the UK economy. So what about the 22 per cent not working? Well, the UK government has already reached an agreement with the EU on out-of-work benefits. Newly arrived EU migrants are banned from claiming jobseekers' allowance for three months. If they have not found a job within six months they will be required to leave. EU migrant workers in the UK who lose their job, through no fault of their own, are entitled to the same benefits as UK citizens, including jobseekers' allowance and housing benefit, for six months. And by way of reminder, David Cameron secured concessions from the EU in his negotiations whereby access of newly arriving EU workers to non-contributory in-work benefits is limited for a total period of up to four years from the commencement of employment. David Cameron may have failed in his original demand to ban migrant workers from sending child benefit money back home but he successfully gained agreement that payments will instead be linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live. The new rules will apply immediately for new arrivals, and for existing claimants from 2020.  Leave campaigners also point to the impact of immigrants on wages and employment. First, let us dispel the argument often made that EU workers are low-skilled. EU employees in the UK are on average more highly educated than their UK peers. Only 15 per cent of EU employees left formal education before the age of 17 against 44 per cent of UK-born employees. More than 40 per cent of EU workers were educated beyond the age of 21 compared with less than a quarter of UK-born workers.  Law school professor's takedown of the Brexit argument goes viral  Moreover, there is little evidence that more migrants push wages down or unemployment up. Economists from the Centre for Economic Performance in School of Economics (also not Government lackeys) say that when they look at the areas with the largest increase in EU immigration, these have not seen the sharpest falls in employment or wages since 2008. Research published last year by the Office for Budget Responsibility suggested there was a small negative effect of migration on the wages of locals in the semi-skilled and unskilled service sector, such as care workers, shop assistants, restaurant and bar workers but the impact of migration on the wages of the UK-born in this sector since 2004 has been no more than 1 per cent over a period of eight years.  Finally, immigration is not a single issue debate. Significant economic issues are linked. If the UK wants future access to the EU Single Market, we will not be able to \\\"control our borders\\\". Free movement of people lies at the core of EU values alongside free access to EU markets. The Leave campaign has shifted its viewpoint from wanting to negotiate access to the Single Market to seeking alternative models in order to keep the focus on immigration, not economics.  Norway and Switzerland are quoted as potential role models - but they are not. Both Norway and Switzerland have accepted the free movement of EU citizens as part of their trade agreements with the EU. According to the OECD (an organisation that is\"}"
