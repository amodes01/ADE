GBP USD Back on the Decline as Standard Life and Aviva Suspend Property Funds  Three large UK property funds have now suspended activity today to prevent investors from withdrawing money. Standard Life, Aviva and M&G - the UK's largest property fund, with a portfolio encompassing \\u00a34.4 billion in assets - have all seen a large increase in investors removing large amounts of capital as part of a mass desertion of the UK property market.

Factors at risk included the UK's current account deficit, commercial real estate market, household debt and subdued global growth. According to the report;  'The FPC has monitored these channels of risk closely. There is evidence that some risks have begun to crystallise. The current outlook for UK financial stability is challenging.'  However, the Pound's huge losses began to soften. This was thanks to the news that the BoE had relaxed the Countercyclical Capital Buffer (CCyB). The CCyB was put in place to help banks keep operating in the event of another recession by mandating that they maintain a certain level of capital in reserve. This would afford them the funds to keep operating during times of\"}"
