He called for an across-the-board halt of all Muslims entering the country, warning they carried the risk of additional terror attacks.  While many Republicans hoped Trump would back away from his proposed ban on an entire religion, he embraced it even tighter after the Orlando shootings.  \\\"We need to tell the truth, also, about how radical Islam is coming to our shores,\\\" Trump said in the wake of the attack. \\\"And it's coming. With these people, folks, it's coming.\\\"  Trump even blamed \\\"Muslim communities,\\\" en masse, for failing to tip off authorities about both the Orlando and San Bernardino attacks.  \\\"The idea of nativism - of seeing your country under threat by non-natives, specifically immigrants and Muslims, is something that Marine Le Pen and Donald Trump clearly share,\\\" says Cas Mudde, a University of Georgia professor, who specializes in nationalist movements.  / AP / AP French far-right leader Marine Le Pen reacts to the United Kingdom's vote to leave the European Union  Le Pen heads the National Front party in France. In the wake of last year's Paris terror attacks, she told NPR that France needed \\\"to institute a major policy, which would reestablish our own borders. This means we need to stop accepting this influx of immigrants.\\\"  She called the continued flow of Syrian refugees into Europe \\\"madness\\\" and urged for an end to the open-border policy that is a hallmark of the European Union.  \\\"I think when people are disappointed and hurt and angry, they revert to a very basic part of human psychology,\\\" Mounk says. \\\"And that is in-group versus out-group. Us versus them. And it's always easy to blame immigrants.\\\"  It can be popular, too. Exit polls conducted throughout the Republican primaries this year consistently showed a solid majority of GOP voters supporting Trump's call for a temporary ban on Muslim immigration.  Simple solutions  Mounk says the basic approach of many populist, nationalist candidates can be boiled down to this: \\\"I embody the will of the people. And the problems that we face are actually completely straightforward,\\\" he said. \\\"The problem is that the elites are corrupt. They are in cahoots with minorities, with business interests. And all that needs to happen is for me to be elected.\\\"  It's a sentiment that can be heard in Trump's most recent major campaign speech. \\\"When I see the crumbling roads and bridges, or the dilapidated airports, or the factories moving overseas to Mexico, or to other countries for that matter,\\\" he said, \\\"I know these problems can all be fixed. But not by Hillary Clinton. Only by me.\\\"  The best example of a simple solution to a complex problem: Trump's vow to curtail immigrants from entering the country illegally by building a wall across the U.S.-Mexico border - and forcing Mexico to foot the bill.  Hungary's Prime Minister, Viktor Orban, is perhaps the most high-profile nationalist politician to head a nation. He went ahead and built a wall of his own last year in an attempt to stem the flow of migrants from Syria.  \\\"Many people criticize the physical barrier we are just setting up at this moment in Hungary,\\\" he said at the European Union headquarters in Brussels last year. \\\"I ask everybody - all the European leaders - what else ideas they have.\\\"  Is nationalism here to stay?  It's clear that the factors galvanizing nationalist sentiments are not going anywhere any time soon. Western democracies continue to become\"}"
