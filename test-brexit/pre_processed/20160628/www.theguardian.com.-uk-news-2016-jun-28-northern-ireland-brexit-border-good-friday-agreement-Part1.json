The US was one of the main guarantors of the April 1998 Good Friday agreement and can point to the subsequent decline in sectarian violence as a signature foreign policy success in recent times.  But last week's Brexit decision cast a shadow over the only part of the UK that shares a land border with the EU. A majority of people in Northern Ireland voted to remain, a result that could potentially reopen old wounds. Sinn F\\u00e9in's Martin McGuinness, the deputy first minister, called for a poll on Irish reunification, while experts warned that a physical border with the Republic would almost certainly have to be reconstituted.

Photograph: Mapbox, OpenStreetMap  Bruce Morrison, a former US congressman credited with recruiting President Bill Clinton to the peace process, said on Monday: \\\"I think overall it's a terrible decision for the EU, the west and Europe. It's stampeding backwards. There is nothing, in my view, good to say about the decision, but we will make the best of it.\\\"  The Good Friday agreement is not in immediate jeopardy, he insisted, but Northern Ireland will miss the billions of pounds it receives in EU funding. \\\"I do not think that it's going to unravel the agreement, but I think it takes away a level of support for the peace process and for the Northern Ireland that exists in the European Union, where a substantial amount of investment to assist Northern Ireland has occurred. So that's definitely going to be undercut, if not fully eliminated,\\\" Morrison said.  Morrison urged politicians to retain the free, near seamless passage that people currently enjoy between north and south. The border checks of the Troubles have been described as \\\"militarised sites of fear and oppression\\\" and a renewed border could be psychologically damaging after decades of effort to promote peace and reconciliation.  \\\"A hard border would be a horrendous result and I would think that sensible people in London and in Dublin would work to prevent a hard border,\\\" he said. \\\"I think there are ways to have a soft border even though the EU no longer covers both parts of Ireland.\\\"  A member of Congress from Connecticut from 1983 to 1991, Morrison helped secure a US visa for Sinn F\\u00e9in's Gerry Adams, enabling negotiations that culminated in the Good Friday agreement and a sharp reduction in - though not total eradication of - sectarian attacks. Under the peace deal, the secretary of state can call a border poll when there is clear evidence that public opinion has shifted towards a united Ireland.  \\\"I think the political circumstances are going to unravel in ways that are yet to be seen,\\\" he continued. \\\"Obviously, if Scotland carries through with a new referendum and it comes out the other way, that is going to destabilise the United Kingdom for sure, and the role of Northern Ireland in the UK will become more uncertain. In the process of that happening, there will certainly be advocacy for a joining of Northern Ireland with the Republic of Ireland through some kind of border poll.\\\"  Morrison endorsed the current Northern Ireland secretary Theresa Villiers' view that there is not majority support for such a poll, but warned that a decline in investment from a distracted Britain could add fuel to the fire.  \\\"All of that is going to be unsettled and it encourages\"}"
