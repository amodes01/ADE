Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), a long-time critic of the House bill, said Thursday.  Menendez could put a \\\"hold\\\" on the bill, blocking it from consideration unless at least 60 senators vote to advance it.  Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is expected to schedule a vote right before the Senate breaks for its July 4 recess. That would force Democrats to back the bill without a chance to amend it.  A senior Senate Republican leadership aide said this month that any amendments would need unanimous approval, and a senior Democratic leadership aide said most Democrats would support the bill without a chance to amend it: http://bit.ly/290mNXR.  AREA DAD TALKS ABOUT DAUGHTERS, FINANCIAL REGULATION: President Obama knows one place his daughters will not end up working: Wall Street.  In a new interview, Obama laughed off the idea that anyone in his family would end up working in the financial sector. In fact, he suggested that too many talented Americans may be wooed by power and paychecks on Wall Street and could use their abilities elsewhere.  \\\"If you start getting to the point where 40 percent of the economy is taken up by the financial sector and that our best and brightest are going into financial work as opposed to engineering or computer science, then we could actually lose our competitive edge over time,\\\" he told Bloomberg Businessweek.  \\\"I am pretty certain that my daughters will not end up working on Wall Street,\\\" he said when asked about their future.  Obama went on to argue that the financial sector still needs to take a broader perspective on its role in the country and the lingering anger in the public toward Wall Street.

REID: HOUSE-PASSED ZIKA DEAL A DISGRACE: Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) ripped a GOP deal to provide $1.1 billion to fight the Zika virus hours after it passed the House.  \\\"It's a disgrace. It's a mockery of how Congress should treat an emergency,\\\" he said from the Senate floor. \\\"This is something that I am sorry to say is part of the McConnell-Trump tactics we have found lately.\\\"  Reid's comments come after House Republicans approved the plan in an early morning vote over the protest of Democrats.  The Zika deal - which is attached to a larger military and veterans spending bill - would be partially paid for by using money from other health department proprieties, including the Ebola virus fund.  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) tried to temper Democratic opposition, saying the House-passed deal \\\"represents our only chance to put Zika control money to work right now.\\\"  \\\"The House did its part. Now the Senate needs to do its part,\\\" he added. The Hill's Jordain Carney takes us there: http://bit.ly/28TzZ3s.  FED WEIGHS CHANGES AFTER HEIST: The Federal Reserve is considering \\\"enhanced monitoring\\\" for certain kinds of transactions, after hackers stole $81 million from the Bangladesh central bank's account at the New York branch, Fed chairman Janet Yellen told lawmakers Wednesday.  \\\"We expect the institutions we supervise to make sure that they comply with procedures to control access to critical payment services and to review and insure that they are meeting security requirements,\\\" Yellen said in response to questions from Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.), who said she was \\\"very concerned\\\" about the breach.  \\\"I think this is a threat to the U.S. banking system,\\\" Maloney said.  The New York Fed's systems were not compromised, Yellen emphasized during a House Financial Services hearing on\"}"
