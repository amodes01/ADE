Economic forecasters have said a British break could push the country back into recession, with the rest of the globe vulnerable to the ripples. Many geopolitical strategists also warn that a vote to leave could divide the Western alliance and be a boon to others such as Russian President Vladimir Putin. But many of the 46 million Britons eligible to vote have paid little heed, with surveys showing that anxiety over immigration is trumping all other voter concerns. The \\\"leave\\\" campaign has played on those fears, arguing - with little supporting evidence - that Turkey will soon join the European Union and intensify the flood of migrant workers arriving on British shores under the bloc's free-movement rules. It has also dismissed warnings from independent experts as part of an elitist plot, what it terms \\\"Project Fear.\\\" Two of the top Brexit campaigners - Johnson and Justice Secretary Michael Gove - have invoked provocative Nazi comparisons. Johnson has suggested that E.U. ambitions mirror those of Hitler's Germany, and Gove has painted Brexit critics as akin to Nazi propagandists who sought to discredit Albert Einstein. The \\\"remain\\\" side has returned fire in recent days. (\\u2026) Whichever side wins Thursday will have to reckon with the profound and emotional schisms in British society that have come to the surface during the campaign. When Cameron promised a referendum in January 2013, he had hoped the vote would put to rest a debate over Europe that has bedeviled Britain for decades and that has generated particularly deep fault lines in his Conservative Party. Instead, the campaign appears only to have made those divisions worse, while also layering the debate with the added complexity of personal ambition. Several prominent campaigners - especially Johnson - are thought to be jockeying for Cameron's job if the country defies the prime minister and votes for an exit. Even if \\\"remain\\\" wins, Britain's angst is unlikely to be resolved. Some \\\"leave\\\" campaigners have said they will press for another referendum if they come up short in a close vote. Thursday's vote also has the potential to reawaken another fundamental question of British identity. Scottish leaders say that if Britain votes to leave the European Union against the will of the pro-European Scots, they will renew their push for independence just two years after losing a referendum vote. The outcome will be watched closely in capitals around the globe. President Obama has weighed in strongly for the \\\"remain\\\" side, saying he thinks Britain is a more valuable ally from within the European Union. All of Britain's E.U. allies have said they, too, want Britain to stay. To illustrate the point, European landmarks from Paris to Warsaw have been bathed in the colors of the Union Jack this week, along with the message \\\"Vote Remain.\\\" In an op-ed in Britain's Guardian newspaper Wednesday morning, Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi wrote that a vote to leave would be \\\"the wrong choice.\\\"  As things stand, the battle between the 'Remain' and 'Leave' forces remains far to close to call and it could be well into Friday morning London time before we have any idea what the outcome might be, especially given the fact that authorities are expecting record-breaking turnout across the U.K. The Poll of Polls, roughly equivalent to the polling averages of polls in the United States kept by RealClearPolitics and and Pollster, has 'Remain' with 51% of the vote to 49% for 'Leave, a number that indicates that the outcome could go either way.
