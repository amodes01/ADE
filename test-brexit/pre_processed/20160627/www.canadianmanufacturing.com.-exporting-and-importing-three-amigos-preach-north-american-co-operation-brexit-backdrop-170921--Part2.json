Sources in two countries say the summit's goal is to entrench regular, ongoing collaboration in a host of areas ranging from climate change to public health issues like the Zika virus, peacekeeping, ocean management and refugee flows.  In a recent letter to U.S. Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker, the Canadian American Business Council called for the creation of a three-country cabinet group like the U.S.-Mexico one created in 2013.  \\\"Continued and deepened economic and commercial co-operation, integration and policy alignment are necessary. This means that we need established platforms in which to address the economic relationships of both bilateral relationships shared by the U.S.\\\"  But Hampson and Dade say Canada and Mexico should be focusing on strengthening their direct relationship so they can help each other deal with the rising American protectionist sentiment.  Mexico and Canada co-operated to force the U.S. to abandon its country-of-origin rules of labelling on its meat products after victories at the World Trade Organization. They have also worked together to fight protectionist Buy American rules.
