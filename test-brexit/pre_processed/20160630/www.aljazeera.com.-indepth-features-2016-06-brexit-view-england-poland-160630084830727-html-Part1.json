Boston, United Kingdom - At first glance the town of Boston, on the east coast of England, looks like any other old English market town. A large parish church dominates the skyline and locals wander through the rain across cobbled streets and narrow passageways.  But, away from the main square, across a bridge over the River Witham and towards nearby West Street, the town starts to look and feel decidedly different.  On a 350-metre stretch of road one can find a Baltic food supplier with an EU flag on its shopfront, a Polish mini-mart beneath a flat festooned with St George's cross flags and an information centre offering currency transfers and benefits advice to new arrivals.  According to the 2011 census, Boston, dubbed \\\"Little Poland\\\" by some locals, had a higher proportion of Eastern Europeans than anywhere in England and Wales.  Since the European Union expanded to include 10 new countries in 2004, thousands have flocked to the small, sleepy, East Midlands town, drawn to jobs in fields and factories and comparatively higher wages. Between 2001 and 2011, Boston's foreign-born population rose by 467 percent, the highest increase in England and Wales.  Rising immigration  While some local farmers have benefited from the supply of cheap migrant labour, many locals are unhappy. In last week's EU referendum their feelings were clear, with 75.6 percent voting to leave - the highest percentage in the UK.  Like in many places across the country, the decisive issue here was immigration.  \\\"We can not sustain the amount of people we have got here,\\\" says Nick, a 61-year-old night porter at the New England Hotel who voted to leave and gives only his first name.  \\\"Everywhere you go, public services are being cut and yet the number of migrants is increasing. The amount of alcohol consumed in the town is probably five times what it was 10 years ago. They drink on the streets, they urinate up the walls, up the trees, in corners, they defecate in the bushes in the park. It might be good for their country but we are a civilised country and it does not go down well,\\\" he said.  Jonathan Noble, a 62-year-old local councillor with the far-right, anti-immigration UK Independence Party (UKIP), says his group had an \\\"overwhelming degree of public support\\\" during months of campaigning in the town.  \\\"There is competition for jobs which has had the effect of depressing wages in a low-wage area,\\\" he says, sitting in a tweed jacket, shirt and tie outside Boston's White Hart Hotel.  \\\"There is too much pressure on local schools, tremendous pressure on GP surgeries, pressure on housing. People that want to get on the council housing list are competing with foreign nationals,\\\" Noble says. \\\"All these things combine.\\\"  Immigration or exploitation?  Not everyone thinks that immigration is to blame for the town's problems, however. In a richly decorated council chamber at Boston Town Hall, local Labour councillor Paul Gleeson says migration has massively benefited the area despite the large vote to leave.  \\\"We now have many more people working here, our shops are not empty and our schools are achieving well,\\\" he says. \\\"The only problem we have is that these people are foreign, and locals do not like that.\\\"  I hope the government does not start treating us like second-class citizens. That was my first feeling after the referendum. It was a loud signal that we are not welcome any more. by Karol Sokolowski  While Gleeson admits there are\"}"
