A pre-Brexit vote assessment by the CBI and PricewaterhouseCoopers said that as many as 100,000 jobs could go in the financial services sector, a view shared by many delegates at the British Bankers' Association's annual retail banking conference on Wednesday (29 June).  Contrary to public perception Frankfurt, as opposed to Paris, emerged as a more popular contingency destination. However, the German finance hub is dwarfed by the sector's sheer scale of manpower in London. As of 31 December, 2015, data indicates that 559,800 people were working in the City of London and Canary Wharf.  That is more than three quarters of Frankfurt's entire population, according to the last available census. Neither moving professionals nor convincing those used to a life in London to move would be easy, senior bankers say. Furthermore, most admit, whether Frankfurt or Paris, neither solution beats London in terms of attracting talent and ease of conducting financial services.  The city tops the latest Global Financial Centres Index (GFCI), which ranks competitiveness within the sector. It is followed by New York and Singapore and its nearest European rival, Zurich, comes in sixth. The Swiss financial hub is not in the European Union either. It too is involved in Switzerland's wrangles with the EU, after the country voted to end its freedom of labour agreement under European Economic Area auspices with the bloc earlier this year.  By contrast, EU rivals Frankfurt, Dublin, Paris and Amsterdam languish in 18th, 29th, 32nd and 34th places respectively on the GFCI. Yet, the sector is bracing itself for months, perhaps years, of wrangling over London's financial clout post-Brexit and UK job losses are inevitable.  London is likely to be poorer as a result, and by default the financial services world will be as well. To quote one senior banker, \\\"This is uncertainty we did not need; these are questions we needn't have asked; and it's a problem we could have done without in the current climate.\\\"\"}"
