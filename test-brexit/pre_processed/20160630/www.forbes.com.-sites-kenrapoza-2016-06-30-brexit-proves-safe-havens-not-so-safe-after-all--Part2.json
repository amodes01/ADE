"{\"uid\": \"www.forbes.com.-sites-kenrapoza-2016-06-30-brexit-proves-safe-havens-not-so-safe-after-all-\", \"text\": \"week's referendum.\\\"  Bloomberg's Leonid Bershidsky noted on Monday that French and German Foreign Ministers Jean-Marc Ayrault and Frank-Walter Steinmeier have emerged with a 9 page document proposing a new direction for the E.U., a United States of Europe so to speak. What took them so long? Or better yet, what on Earth are they thinking?  They outlined a new course of action on security, immigration and building a fiscal union for member states. The arrangement is likely a non-starter. Angela Merkel, the defacto Queen of Europe, is simply not on board with this kind of program.  There is money to be made in all this.  \\\"There are obvious longer term risks, not the least of which is the implication for the success of similar popular movements in other countries in Europe,\\\" say Los Angeles based TCW Group's emerging market fund managers led by Penelope Foley in a note on Friday. \\\"Our take away from this event is that global growth will be slower and developed market central banks will increase their accommodative policies. We are in a lower for longer rate environment...and emerging markets will be a longer term beneficiary,\\\" she says.  As the core economies stagnate and crumble under the weight of one crisis to the next, the poorer nations of the world are still left picking up the pieces. Most of the world's wealth is in the developed world. Most of the world's major multi-nationals are from there. If they are in trouble, they are unlikely to invest in China, or Brazil. That's not a hard and fast rule, but it's a problem. Emerging markets are still tethered to the core. And the core is weighing them down.  Cheaper capital could mean a turning point in relative growth rates for emerging markets versus the U.S. and Europe, leading to a near term buying opportunity for securities -- both equity and debt. A lot of that will depend on China. And major emerging markets like Brazil and Russia coming out of a two and a half year slump. Either way, there is not much in the way of conviction for investors, other than value hunters and cowboy hedge funds that like to play markets undergoing \\\"regime change\\\".\"}"
