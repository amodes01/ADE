The high rate of Islamic migration has also posed challenges to national security. As CBS has reported, \\\"The Cedar-Riverside neighborhood of Minneapolis [which] is sometimes called 'Little Mogadishu'\\\" given that it is the \\\"center of the nation's largest concentration of Somalis,\\\" has become a \\\"fertile ground for Islamic terrorist groups recruiting new fighters.\\\"  As the Minneapolis Star Tribune has reported, a Congressional report found that \\\"Minnesota leads the nation in would-be ISIL terrorists from U.S.\\\"  Moreover, evidence has shown that the recent Orlando terrorist attack, in which the son of Afghan migrants targeted the LGBT community and slaughtered 49 people in a gay nightclub, was motivated by anti-Western ideology that was imported from foreign nations rather than \\\"homegrown.\\\"  As Andrew McCarthy has explained, \\\"The inspiration for Muslims to brutalize and mass murder gay people does not come from ISIS. It is deeply rooted in Islamic law, affirmed by many of Islam's most renowned scholars.\\\"  McCarthy explains that \\\"the mandate that homosexuals be killed\\\" comes from Sharia - not ISIS. \\\"This is why, wherever sharia is the law, homosexuals are persecuted and killed,\\\" McCarthy writes. \\\"[With the Orlando terror attack] we have gotten another glimpse of radicalization, which is not \\\"homegrown\\\" but rather fueled by a foreign, anti-American, anti-liberty ideology.\\\"  According to Pew, nearly all Muslims in Afghanistan (99 percent) support sharia law as official law. Between 2001 and 2014, the U.S. permanently resettled more than 40,000 migrants from Afghanistan on green cards.  Additionally, between 2001 and 2014, the U.S. permanently resettled 674,920 migrants from nations where gays can be executed, according to data from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).  This figure does not include the total number of migrants the U.S. has permanently resettled from Muslim nations during that time, which is nearly 1.7 million.  The current rate of U.S. immigration is record high. Every day the U.S. admits enough net immigrants to fill an overcrowded, metropolitan high school. Every month the U.S. imports a population of immigrants that is larger than the occupancy of Lambeau Field, where the Green Bay Packers play.  Since Wisconsin voters sent Paul Ryan to Washington, the U.S. has imported a population of immigrants that is nearly three times larger than the entire population of Wisconsin.  In seven years time - unless Congress takes action to curb U.S. visa distributions - the foreign-born share of the U.S. population will reach an all-time high. In the 1920s, the last time the foreign-born share of the population reached a record high, then-President Calvin Coolidge hit the pause button for roughly fifty years, producing an era of explosive wage growth and allowing immigrants already in the country to assimilate.  Paul Ryan, however, has made clear that he does not wish to curb immigration, but instead has pushed legislation that would substantially increase immigration.  According to Pew polling data, 92 percent of the GOP electorate - and 83 percent of the American electorate as a whole - is opposed to such an agenda and wants to see immigration levels frozen or reduced. Ryan represents only a minuscule seven percent of the GOP electorate that wants to increase migration rates.  As NumbersUSA president Roy Beck has explained, \\\"Open borders is in his [Paul Ryan's] ideological DNA\"}"
