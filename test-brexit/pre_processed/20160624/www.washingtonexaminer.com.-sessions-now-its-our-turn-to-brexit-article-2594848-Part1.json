Just as the services were breathing a little easier with fresh money from Congress for spare parts and maintenance operations to begin to restore the readiness of their crippled aviation squadrons, the big guy issued orders to march in double time. On Tuesday, news broke that Defense Secretary Jim Mattis issued a memo last month to the Air Force and Navy departments giving them just 12 months to get 80 percent of their fighter jets fit for combat.  While no one is complaining publicly, several of the players in the tactical aviation units I talked to yesterday indicated that Mattis' tall order may be a tad unrealistic. \\\"Up to now our talking point has been that it took us years to get into this problem, it's going to take years to get out,\\\" said one officer who asked not to be identified. \\\"We are in a big hole,\\\" said another.  For example, only 53.3 percent of Navy F/A-18 Super Hornets are rated \\\"mission-capable,\\\" meaning they are fit to fly, but even they may not be combat-ready, which requires a higher rating of \\\"fully mission-capable.\\\" And only last month, the number of F/A-18s available was below 50 percent.  \\\"Those are horrific numbers, all of them,\\\" said John Venable, a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation who served 25 years in the Air Force. \\\"It's a huge lift but it is about time they got the pressure.  \\\"The laissez-faire style of leadership is gone and that left with the Obama administration and the commanders that were associated with that. They were not given the funds, they were not given the certainty they needed to lead their forces. Well, now there is no excuses. These guys have the money, they have the personnel, they have the machinery,\\\" Venable said.  LEARN FROM THE PROS: The Mattis memo orders the services to bring mission-capable rates for their F-35, F-22, F-16 and F/A-18 fleet above 80 percent by Oct. 15 of next year. \\\"I am just not sure that's possible,\\\" lamented one aviation officer. Mattis directed the services to take a page out of the private-sector playbook, and use the best practices of commercial aviation companies to improve readiness quickly. \\\"I am confident in our Department's ability to generate additional capacity from our current aircraft inventory, alongside the commercial aviation industry's sustainment of high availability rates,\\\" Mattis wrote in the Sept. 17 memo.  The Senate Armed Services Committee drilled down on the commercial industry's example during testimony by Air Force leaders on Wednesday. \\\"I did a little sniffing around, I think Delta Airlines, their aircraft readiness in their fleet is about 86 percent. I believe it's somewhere along those lines. Yet for the [Air Force] F-35 that's a new airplane, coming online, coming to the fleet, I think it's in the \\u2026 mid-60s,\\\" Sen. Dan Sullivan, a subcommittee chairman, said while questioning Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson and Gen. David Goldfein, the Air Force chief of staff.  LOW RATES: Sullivan's estimate for Air Force F-35 readiness turns out to be overly optimistic. The real rate is just over half, and slightly better than its cousin the F-22. The Air Force gave the following breakdown of its mission-capable rates, which it said was from fiscal 2017, the most recent year from which data were available, even though we know the rates are tracked almost daily:  F-16C: 70.22%  F-16D: 65.96%  F-22A: 49.01%  F-35A: 54.67%  Wilson told Sullivan that despite the overall low capability rate for the F-35, its readiness actually varies\"}"
