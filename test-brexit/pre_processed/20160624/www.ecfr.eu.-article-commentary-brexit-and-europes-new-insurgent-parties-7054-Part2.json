Who are Europe's new insurgent parties?  This study looks at voices outside the political mainstream that are influencing and shaping the development of EU foreign policy today. For each member state we selected the most influential non-mainstream groups - for some countries such as Slovakia or the Czech Republic, where there are many such parties, we focused on a selection. The only member state in which we decided there was no relevant party was Luxembourg.  The parties we have included are not exclusively of the right or the left, ranging from the Communist Party in France and socialist Die Linke in Germany, through to far-right groups such as Golden Dawn in Greece, Lega Nord in Italy, and Jobbik in Hungary. Some challenge the establishment from the sidelines, and some, such as Law and Justice in Poland, and Syriza and the Independent Greeks in Greece, are serving in current coalition governments. The insurgent parties are broadly sceptical about the EU in its current state. Their positions range vastly within this, from France's Front National and Britain's UKIP, which was founded with the aim of taking the UK out of the EU, through to Portugal's Left Bloc and Spain's Podemos, which advocate for EU reform.  A sense of the need to \\\"re-democratise\\\" policymaking nationally and across the EU is common to almost all these parties, with Switzerland often held up as an example. They all see their role as speaking the truth and challenging the elites on behalf of the people. The youngest, ALFA, was formed in Germany in July 2015 as a breakaway from anti-immigrant party Alternative f\\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD), while the oldest, Ireland's Sinn F\\u00e9in, was founded in 1905.  Foreign policy  Through interviews with foreign policy representatives of each party that agreed to meet up - 41 out of the 45 we covered - and analysis of their public pronouncements, we explored their positions on the key foreign policy challenges facing the EU. These include the refugee crisis and the EU's relationship with Turkey; security and terrorist threats to Europe; the Ukraine crisis and the EU's relationship with Russia; EU-US relations, including on Middle East policy and trade; and the UK referendum.  Most of the parties focus primarily on domestic issues, and some lack fully developed foreign policy positions - for example, different representatives of Germany's AfD gave different answers on foreign policy, and other party representatives stated that they could only answer in a personal capacity. But even newer parties, which have had less time to elaborate policy beyond the core issues on which they were founded, are quickly developing their positions on foreign policy. They are driven towards this by the impact of the refugee crisis across the EU, and the interplay between its foreign and domestic dimensions.  There was a surprising amount of consensus on the existential threats facing the EU. For 34 out of the 45 parties covered, the refugee crisis or the threat of terrorism and radical Islamism (these issues were inextricably linked in the responses of most) were among the top two threats facing the EU. This response was not the preserve of the right wing: it was shared by Germany's Die Linke, the French Communist Party, Spain's Podemos, and the Lithuanian Labour Party.  On the refugee crisis, Angela Merkel's \\\"refugees welcome\\\" policy does not appear to attract the criticism that might have been expected: only seven parties put it among their two most important\"}"
