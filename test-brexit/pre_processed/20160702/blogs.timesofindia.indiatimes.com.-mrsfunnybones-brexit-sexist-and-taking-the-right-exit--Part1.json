She narrowly escaped a gruesome tragedy when Bollywood tried to bludgeon her brain to the size of a pea, but she ducked at the right moment and escaped miraculously unharmed; she is now a popular columnist as well and is currently in the process of creating lame jokes like ' Why do all Hindu boys worship their mother? Because their religion tells them to worship the cow.' She firmly believes that nothing in life is sacred except laughter. (Not even her name, which she is secretly trying to change to Chetali Bhagat so that her columns get made into movies.) LESS ... MORE  Thursday: The man of the house does not like driving, especially along these alien Italian roads, and when I say, 'Take that left exit!' he ignores me.  After driving around in five circles, we realize that as usual I was right and the left exit was indeed the right one. This revelation leads to a massive argument till the prodigal son chirps up, 'Dad! Mom is just cranky, she must be getting her period. You know how she gets!'  To which I roar, 'That is sexist! Every time a woman is upset it's not because of her hormones! And if it were not for my periods, you would not be sitting in this car with that chocolate bar in your hand, mister!'  The prodigal son splutters, 'Mom, that's really unfair! I told you that I totally believe in gender equality when we had classes on that topic last semester. I just made a calculated deduction. See, your stomach is poking out a bit, you have a pimple on your chin, and you have been very irritable!'  'What are you, ACP Pradyuman from that CID show?' I holler, 'Mind your own business!'  Unfortunately, the prodigal son has the last laugh because just by sheer coincidence, an hour later, my body decides to give me its very own communist greeting with a cheery 'Lal Salaam!' And we have to make an emergency stop at the nearest pharmacy.  Friday: Sipping a cup of peppermint tea as tiny brown birds try to get at bits of jam and bread on our table, I get the news that like my teabag, Britain is also up to its neck in hot water.  'Brexit is a reality!' scream headlines and as people at the tables around us begin diluting their fresh orange juice with tears, watching their shares in Barclays and Lloyds drop down the rabbit hole, my friend's maasi, Daljeet Aunty, who has just joined us after a week in England, says, 'Sanu ki! I was just telling your uncle, as it is we had to get solo visa for England, this Europe wala Schengen visa does not work there, so we Indians are in same position like before only, of standing with folded hands at UK embassy, na? I toh wish this break-up shake-up would have happened a week earlier, then with the pound dropping, I would have got all my Marks things at half the rate. One thing is there, today you people are saying British are fools, but no one makes brassieres better than their Marks and Spencer, it is still world best in underclothes only!'  We then leave the consequences of Brexit along with our breakfast table to drive from Italy to Switzerland with just a nonchalant wave to the lone guard standing at the border gate. Long live the European Union!  Saturday: It's been a month of exits in India as Raghuram Rajan steps down as RBI governor and finance minister Arun Jaitley makes a hasty departure from China.  The person partly responsible for both seems to be BJP MP Subramanian Swamy who first declared that Mr Rajan was 'mentally not\"}"
