It really appears that the entire continent consists of stubborn 'global holocaust deniers', people who sit in front of the chimneys of crematoriums, where their victims are being burned alive, unable to think about anything else except their own comfort and privileges.  For as long as such a mentality prevails (and it has been prevailing for endless centuries), to the rest of the world it will matter very little or nothing whether one or two or five countries opt to leave the European Union.  Whether it is more centrally run, or decentralized, the continent will continue plundering the Planet together with its mighty North American offspring.  It will continue, because the European people want it; they actually indirectly demand it! Like some spoiled, heartless and thoroughly immoral brats, Europeans shout 'more, more and damn more!'  And they hate, with naked fanaticism, each and every country on Earth, from China to Russia, which is standing on its feet and refusing to accept Western dictates. It is not like that 'primitive' racism that one can detect in some parts of the United States; European racism is as profound, fundamentalist, cultural, institutionalized, as it isvitriolic and ancient. 'Thanks to it', dozens of cultures and nations have already been annihilated, all over the world. And dozens are being ruined right now as this essay is being written.  The referendum in the UK has proved all this, and more.  Back to Fanon and Sartre: it is clear that the world will not change because the Europeans suddenly got enlightened, realizing that they are living off theft. It cannot be expected from them. There is no remorse. There is not even any recognition of guilt! Look at those thousands of European 'experts', sitting in all the UN and 'development' agencies, or flying all over the world, preaching to the world about how it should be governed, or those Protestant preachers who are helping to overthrow progressive governments. They do it with absolutely straight faces and no shame! Look at those schools and universities in Europe and the US, giving scholarships to the elites of colonized countries, brainwashing them, and conditioning them for the purpose of committing treason.  Western empires (in the past) and now \\\"the Empire\\\"have already destroyed most of the world, and the masses in Europe and even in North America have been greatly benefiting from those countless heinous crimes against humanity. This terrible process still continues. The world will have to return tothe unfinished 'business' of the de-colonization struggle if it wants to survive.  There can be no morally acceptable discussion in Europe about the future of the world, of Europe, of the UK or any other European country that would not begin like this:  \\\"We ruined the world. We robbed the world. We are still ruining and robbing it. Because of the West's imperialism, fundamentalism and greed, hundreds of millions, perhaps a billion human lives have been lost. We are not qualified to govern the Planet and we never were. We cannot indefinitely reward ourselves with ridiculously generous benefits and outrageously high standards of living, as they have beenfinanced bymany centuries of looting, genocides and holocausts. Our present-day institutions, from NATO to the EU, are helping to sustain such criminalglobal order. Some of us now want to dismantle them, on strictly ethical grounds, in the name of the humane race. Therefore we are calling for a referendum\\u2026\\\"  Unthinkable, of course!
