Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said at a summit in Warsaw that they \\\"stand together\\\" on Russia, with NATO's eastern flank still nervous after Moscow's shock annexation of Crimea and the Ukraine conflict.  Russian President Vladimir Putin has opposed NATO's decision to put four battalions in Poland and the Baltic states, seeing the expansion into Moscow's Soviet-era backyard as a security threat.  NATO is keen to downplay any divisions, but there have been calls from countries like France and Germany to avoid a Cold-War style stand-off when Moscow's help is needed on issues such as terrorism.

Leaders will discuss Ukraine with President Petro Poroshenko later Saturday.  The United States and European Union have both imposed sanctions on Moscow over the Ukraine crisis but in Europe in particular there are growing calls for them to be scaled back.  France and Germany, which have strong political and economic ties to Russia, have played a leading role in efforts to solve the Ukraine conflict, helping to broker the Minsk ceasefire accords.
