Campaign leader Danny Miller said: \\\"From the looks of it, the British people have chosen to take control of their political and economic destiny. The forces of fear have lost.  \\\"It is now important for Texas to look to Brexit as an inspiration and an example that Texans can also take control of our destiny. It is time for Texans to rally with us and fight for the right to become a self-governing nation.\\\" He called on the governor of Texas to support his group's desire for an Texit referendum, highlighting the state's forced submission to the national government - a comparison that could be made with the EU's overwhelming control over the laws and borders of the 28-country bloc.  GETTY Texas has an incredibly strong identity and calls for outright independence are growing  The win for Brexit opens the door for Texit Danny Miller  Mr Miller said: \\\"It is past time that the people of Texas had their say on our continued relationship with the Union and its sprawling Federal bureaucracy. \\\"The win for Brexit opens the door for Texit by establishing, concretely, that it is possible to have an adult conversation on independence and letting the people have the final say.\\\" He pointed to his \\\"260,000 supporters\\\" and hundreds of thousands of social media followers as proof there was a real demand for an in-out referendum, concluding: \\\"For several years now, we have been receiving new supporters and volunteers at a pace like we have never seen. \\\"And as word about the Brexit referendum has spread throughout Texas, people are realizing that the TNM is offering a real choice and a real solution and not just more of the same.\\\"  SUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you have consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

He said: \\\"It was exciting to watch self-determination in action, and in the end the majority of the British people determined for themselves in a historic and inspiring election that their future would be better off independent of the European Union.
