"{\"uid\": \"www.jewishledger.com.-2016-06-u-k-s-historic-brexit-vote-leaves-israel-pondering-policy-trade-implications-\", \"text\": \"for National Security Studies think tank, said the vote raises questions as to whether or not Europe will be willing and able to affect policies and solve problems outside of its borders.  \\\"I think that Europe in the next two years, if not longer, will be mostly engaged in Europe, and primarily engaged in external threats which are immediate,\\\" Eran said.  \\\"So I wonder if Europe will find the strength and stamina to deal with profound issues,\\\" including those rattling the Middle East, he said.  For Israel, the vote comes against the backdrop of a French-initiated campaign to restart peace negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians. The EU has been increasingly critical of Israeli actions in recent years and recently passed a controversial regulation labeling products manufactured in Israeli settlements.  This coming week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is headed to Rome to discuss renewed peace efforts with United States Secretary of State John Kerry, who is similarly supportive of the French effort. Israel has rejected the initiative, maintaining that peace negotiations must be handled between the Israelis and Palestinians themselves, and not thrust upon the parties by outside actors.  According to Nirenstein, the Brexit vote \\\"will not have any effect on the renewed peace push.\\\" She added that while Europe will remain a vital trade partner with Israel, even in light of the Brexit vote, \\\"Israel does not count on Europe for its future, and particularly for its long-term future.\\\"  \\\"As a union of 27 nations instead of 28, they will still pass anti-Israel resolutions, and Israel must still keep up its guard against the European Union. There is a need for Israel to look beyond Europe,\\\" Nirenstein said.  \\\"Israel is increasingly looking towards other markets-toward China, toward Russia, toward India,\\\" she said. \\\"Africa is a very good market. There is more of a possibility to expand Israeli trade and its culture of innovation. These emerging markets appreciate Israel very much\\u2026.It's no coincidence that Prime Minister Netanyahu is going to Africa in the coming weeks.\\\"  CAP: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (right) and British Prime Minister David Cameron attend a joint press conference in Jerusalem on March 12, 2014.
