Photograph: Huntingdon Living Facebook  Why this sudden explosion? Paul Bagguley, a sociologist based at the University of Leeds, points to the gleeful tone of the racism: \\\"There is a kind of celebration going on; it's a celebratory racism.\\\" With immigration cited in polls as the second most common reason in voting for Brexit, \\\"people are expressing a sense of power and success, that they have won,\\\" he says.  \\\"People have not changed. I would argue the country splits into two-thirds to three-quarters of people being tolerant and a quarter to a third being intolerant. And a section of that third have become emboldened. At other times, people are polite and rub along.\\\"  Bagguley stresses that it wasn't racist to vote leave, and that many people were voting about \\\"political control\\\", yet the Brexit campaign's relentless rhetoric about \\\"controlling our borders\\\" has led people who might previously have kept their intolerant views to themselves to feel legitimised. A spokesperson from campaign group Hope not Hate points out that, while not all Ukip voters are racists, it does \\\"swallow up the 'respectable racist' vote that might have once gone to the BNP\\\". Bagguley agrees: \\\"People have to be prepared to be more critical of them and the implicit racism that runs through much of what they say.\\\"  Simon Woolley, the director of Operation Black Vote, goes further. \\\"The Brexiters, with their jingoistic rhetoric, have put the country on a war footing. By framing the debate as 'we want our country back', they have made immigrants the enemy and occupiers who need to be expelled.\\\"  The turmoil that followed the vote - with sterling in freefall, and the leadership of Britain's two main political parties in disarray - has also played a part, according to Bagguley. \\\"At times of generalised social crises, people think they can get away with things in public that they would not normally do.\\\" On Tuesday, video footage emerged that appeared to show a mixed-race man being racially abused on a Manchester tram. Police have made three arrests over the incident.  Corinne Abrahams, 24, witnessed a similar incident in London as she made her way home from the Glastonbury festival on Monday. As she sat on the tube at around 2pm, a man \\\"began shouting things such as: 'Russians are all scumbags' and 'Poles should all leave'\\\". Another passenger protested and the argument grew heated. Other travellers moved away, but Abrahams, who has Jewish heritage, says she could not stay silent. \\\"My people have gone through all this before. I do not want it to have to happen to others. I said: 'You are an embarrassment to the country. No one else here agrees with what you are saying.' He replied: 'I am a real British man. This is my country.' It was unprovoked and disgusting.\\\"  View image in fullscreen A National Front banner in Newcastle. Photograph: Emma Foster  Bagguley says that what makes the recent attacks unusual is who they are directed at. Central to the anti-EU discourse in the media over the past decade has been a sense of British people being fundamentally different from Europeans. As Scottish politics and identity moved in a new direction, this mutated into a white English nationalism \\\"that has a resonance with racial ways of thinking\\\", he says.  \\\"This has been the bedrock and basis for this xenophobia, directed at everybody who is a little different. It is unlike the backlash after terrorist attacks, which targeted Irish people in the 70s, or Muslims and those thought to be\"}"
