London, an island of strong \\\"Remain\\\" support, was marooned in a sea of \\\"Leave.\\\" Dispatches from the British hinterland confirmed the impression of Capital against Country. \\\"In shorthand,\\\" Peter Mandler wrote in Dissent, \\\"Britain's EU problem is a London problem.\\\"  In the immediate aftermath of the vote, it certainly seemed that wealthy London-a city of students, immigrants, and tourists, corporate headquarters, and creative industries doing business abroad, all thriving under the status quo-had been castigated by Britain. There was talk of banks relocating from the city to Dublin, Frankfurt, and Paris; anti-immigrant graffiti and attacks; and Londoners renouncing their country. As the U.K. voted to exit the established international system, London's position as the world's pre-eminent global city was diminished. The question was not whether London would suffer the consequences of Brexit, but how much it would suffer.  Easy to forget, amidst all this: Brexit's most famous advocate, Boris Johnson, is the bicycle-commuting, subway-riding former mayor of London, who claimed that a well-managed Brexit was the best possible solution for the city itself. \\\"If you want our great capital to be genuinely open to the world-rather than locked in and diminished by a failing EU system,\\\" he wrote in the Evening Standard before the vote, \\\"then go global, vote Leave, and take back control next week.\\\" Brexit as vote may have been an expression of anti-London sentiment, but Brexit as policy has not always been conceived that way.  Advertisement  Johnson and co. have long argued that London, the global metropolis, had more to lose from the bureaucratic tyranny of the European Union than from a well-managed departure. In a 2014 Greater London Authority report titled \\\"A Win-Win Situation,\\\" Gerard Lyons, Johnson's chief economic adviser and a full-fledged Brexiteer, concluded that an outward-looking Brexit was a far superior option for London than \\\"business as usual\\\" in the EU and would enhance the city's competitive advantage.

An exit accompanied by pro-growth policies, according to this theory, would actually cause London's growth rate to leap even further ahead of the U.K. at large.  Advertisement  In this scenario, Brexit would not, as Manhattan Institute fellow Aaron Renn writes, refute \\\"the urban triumphalist vision\\\" in which \\\"cities, not provinces or nation-states, are the real actors in the global economy.\\\" On the contrary, London's Brexit lobby imagined the city's influence growing. Regulatory freedom, high-skilled immigration, a union of British cities pushing for greater local power: Those were the ingredients for a post-Brexit London, a freewheeling global city-state. (Even London Mayor Sadiq Khan, a Remainer, reacted to the Brexit vote with that hope. \\\"On behalf of all Londoners,\\\" he told business leaders on Tuesday, \\\"I am demanding more autonomy for the capital-right now.\\\")  Greg Clark, a senior fellow at Brookings' Metropolitan Policy Program, takes a similarly sunny view of Brexit. If London adapts quickly, he predicts, \\\"corporations will reorganize rather than leave,\\\" especially with a national immigration policy better-suited for London's needs than\"}"
