Advertisement  The shift in tone illustrates how Britain's vote has abruptly scrambled Obama's reality. Where the president had tried to encourage the UK not to rashly abandon the European bloc, he now must reassure Britain that its decision to do so will not mean its demise. His priority of locking in trade deals before leaving office now becomes a distant second, behind the more urgent task of restoring confidence in the financial markets and in Europe's future.  \\\"The Obama administration - and a number of leaders in Europe as well - is trying to calm the waters. At this point, there are more questions than answers,\\\" said Miriam Sapiro, Obama's former acting trade representative and now an adviser at the strategy firm Finsbury.    Obama's attempt to show support for a struggling ally casts him in the role of forceful free-trade advocate at a time when all of the major presidential candidates running to replace him are vocally opposed. Yet current and former Obama administration officials are operating under the assumption that Democrat Hillary Clinton, if elected, would come around to supporting Obama's trade deals after finding ways to reconcile specific concerns she's raised about jobs, wages and national security.  Advertisement  Before Britain's exit vote, or Brexit, Obama's administration was deep in negotiations toward a sweeping free trade deal with the 28-nation EU. Supporters of the Brexit had argued the UK would not lose out on US commerce because it could easily broker a one-on-one deal with the US. So during a visit to London in April, Obama sought to correct the record, arguing that would not \\\"happen any time soon\\\".\"}"
