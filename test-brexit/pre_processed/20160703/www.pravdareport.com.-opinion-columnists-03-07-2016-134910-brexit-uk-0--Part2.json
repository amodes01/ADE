All they want is to have a better life, live longer, and to grow richer! They find it thoroughly unfair, that in the UK, France, Spain or Greece, those big corporations and banks are keeping most of the loot. They want their share. They want a much bigger share. They want it now! That is why they hate capitalism, the \\\"system\\\". Not because it murders millions of innocent people in all corners of the globe, far away from Europe (such 'stuff' does not bother Europeans one tiny bit). Not because it ruins cultures, kills the freedom of the \\\"others\\\", oh no! They hate it because the \\\"system\\\" is too stingy with its own members!  True, those who are sustaining Europe often have nothing left, not even a few huts, not even the right to keep their own native plants or trees. True, many unemployed Europeans are still driving their cars, flying all over the world in search of perfect vacations, enjoying virtually free education, medical care, parks, cultural institutions, public transportation and countless other benefits. True, most of the refugees are escaping from once rich and independent countries, raped and exploited by the West. But all that is not worth mentioning, there is no need for referendums discussing such 'irrelevant' moral issues. And anyway, what would such referendum be exactly about: \\\"To loot or not to loot\\\"? And where are those millions of European citizens who should be signing petitions, demanding it?  It is never pronounced, but there is no one, virtually no one in Europe left, who would want to change this present global system, from top to bottom, and to stop the plunder of the \\\"insignificant others\\\"!  The European 'left' is as selfish and hypocritical as the 'right'. In fact, there is no real 'left' there, anymore, if the 'left' actually means demanding absolutely equal treatment for all the inhabitants of our Planet.  Many Europeans like to blame the United States for the present state of the world (mostly abstractly, anyway). Such accusations are thoroughly hypocritical, bordering on being intellectually deranged. For the United States is nothing else other than a grand European 'project', or to quote Jean-Paul Sartre, a \\\"super-European monstrosity.\\\"  In the so-called \\\"New World\\\" (what a chauvinist term anyway; as if the ancient world of native people who were crushed, matters nothing), European settlers robbed natives of their land first, and then exterminated almost all of them. To increase 'productivity', they brought millions of slaves from across the ocean. When it suited them, they declared independence, but independence still strictly based on the European exceptionalism, racism, on traditions of superiority complexes and on fundamentalist Christian beliefs.  No matter how barbarically the United States has been behaving abroad, in both 20th and 21st centuries, it has never really managed to catch up (although it certainly tried hard) with that unbridled European savagery, with those horrific extermination and ransacking campaigns 'the old continent' has been undertaking for centuries, in Asia, Africa, the Middle East, the Indian Sub-Continent and virtually in all corners of the globe.  \\\"European workers are now victims of US imperialism and the capitalist system,\\\" the pseudo-left constantly tells us. Oh, is that so?  Actually, how thoroughly ridiculous!  What is the 'capitalist system' really, if not the legitimate (although philosophically and ethically perverse) brainchild of the West,\"}"
