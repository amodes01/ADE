Treasury analysis: The long-term economic impact of EU membership and the alternatives,\\\" April 2016  Leave supporters discounted such economic projections under the label \\\"Project Fear.\\\" A pro-Brexit outfit associated with the U.K. Independence Party (UKIP), which was founded to oppose EU membership, responded by saying that the Treasury's \\\"worst-case scenario of \\u00a34,300 per household is a bargain-basement price for the restoration of national independence and safe, secure borders.\\\"  Although Leave supporters stressed issues of national pride, safety, and sovereignty, they also mustered economic arguments. For example, Johnson said on the eve of the vote, \\\"EU politicians would be banging down the door for a trade deal\\\" the day after the vote, in light of their \\\"commercial interests.\\\"  Vote Leave, the official pro-Brexit campaign, topped the \\\"Why Vote Leave\\\" page on its website with the claim that the U.K. could save \\u00a3350 million per week: \\\"We can spend our money on our priorities like the NHS [National Health Service], schools, and housing.\\\"  In May 2016, the U.K. Statistics Authority, an independent public body, said the figure was gross rather than net, which was \\\"misleading and undermines trust in official statistics.\\\" A mid-June poll by Ipsos MORI, however, found that 47% of the country believed the claim.  The day after the referendum, Nigel Farage, who co-founded UKIP and led it until that November, disavowed the figure and said that he was not closely associated with Vote Leave. May also declined to confirm Vote Leave's NHS promises since taking office.  Brexit Economic Response  Though Britain officially left the EU, 2020 was a transition and implementation period. Trade and customs continued during that time, so there wasn't much on a day-to-day basis that seemed different to U.K. residents. Even so, the decision to leave the EU had an effect on Britain's economy.  The country's gross domestic product (GDP) growth slowed down to around 1.4% in 2018 from 1.9% in 2016 and 2.7% in 2017 as business investment slumped. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicted that the country's economy would grow at 1.3% in 2019 and 1.4% in 2020. Instead, growth was 1.6% in 2019 but -10.4% in 2020. GDP rebounded, however, touching 8.7% in 2021 before slowing to 4.3% in 2022.  The U.K. unemployment rate hit a 44-year low at 3.9% in the three months leading up to January 2019. Experts attribute this to employers preferring to retain workers instead of investing in new major projects.  While the fall in the value of the pound after the Brexit vote helped exporters, the higher price of imports was passed onto consumers and had a significant impact on the annual inflation rate. Consumer Prices Index (CPI) inflation hit 3.1% in the 12\"}"
