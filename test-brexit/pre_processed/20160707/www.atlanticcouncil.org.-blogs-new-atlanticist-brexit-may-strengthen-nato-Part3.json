For the first time in NATO's history there will be a \\\"substantial combat-ready capability forward across the eastern flank of the Alliance,\\\" said Lute.  Differing threat perceptions  Not all NATO member states view the challenges facing Europe in the same order of priority. France, for instance, is more concerned about terrorism in the wake of the attacks in Paris in November of 2015 than the threat posed by Russia, said De Hoop Scheffer.  \\\"You cannot expect France to share the same sense of urgency when it comes to Russia [as] Poland or the Baltic States,\\\" she said. \\\"And you cannot ask the Baltic States or Poland to be as involved as we are in the south to face the crisis of Daesh, but that does not mean that we do not share a sense of unity of purpose.\\\"  \\\"We can be divided when it comes to our own security and defense priorities, but we have to keep the Alliance as united as possible,\\\" she said. \\\"Maybe more important than the military aspect of the Alliance is the political aspect of the Alliance.\\\"  The leaders of Ukraine and Afghanistan will be among those present at NATO's Warsaw Summit. US President Barack Obama announced on July 6 that he will leave 8,400 US troops in Afghanistan when he leaves office next year. That number is up from the 5,500 he had originally pledged to leave in the country.  At Warsaw, NATO leaders will look for ways in which the Alliance can supplement, not supplant, the US-led coalition's effort against ISIS and the EU's attempts to contain the migrant crisis that has been fueled by conflict across the Middle East and North Africa, particularly in Syria, Iraq, and Afghanistan.  \\\"The key is to complement, not compete,\\\" said Lute.
