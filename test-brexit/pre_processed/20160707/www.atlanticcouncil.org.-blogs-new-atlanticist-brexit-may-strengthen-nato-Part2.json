Lute said it was good news if EU member states wish to contribute to their own defense, but, he added the caveat, \\\"autonomy opens the door\\u2026for duplication and inefficiency.\\\"  \\\"There is simply not enough defense investment for duplicate structures,\\\" said Lute. \\\"If we can work this in a way that we compliment and reinforce one another then the US will be the strongest advocate of this, but we are going to be very sharply watching anything that looks like duplication.\\\"  He cited NATO's command structure as an example. \\\"We do not believe that Europe needs a separate command structure just like that into which we pour several thousand people, untold euros, only to duplicate the structure that has been so well tried and true in NATO,\\\" he said.  \\\"At the end of the day, we can not simply hunker down and burrow into our own self-defense. Security for NATO starts with stability beyond NATO and that's why projecting stability is so important,\\\" he added.  The Warsaw Summit  NATO leaders will meet in Warsaw on July 8 and 9. The summit takes place at a time when Europe is facing challenges from a migrant crisis on its south, a revanchist Russia to its east, and the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) or Daesh that has claimed responsibility for terrorist attacks in Paris, Brussels, and Istanbul.  Russia \\\"tore up the international rulebook\\\" and \\\"challenged our vision of a Europe whole, free, and at peace\\\" when it annexed Crimea in March of 2014, said Vershbow.  \\\"NATO has shown that it is very adaptable\\u2026we need some serious adaptation again,\\\" he added. \\\"Warsaw gives us the opportunity to think about the long term. We now sadly recognize that we are in a long-term strategic competition with Russia.\\\"  The Warsaw Summit is expected to send a message of deterrence and defense.  At NATO's Wales Summit in 2014, Alliance member states agreed to enhance the capabilities of the NATO Response Force (NRF) in order to respond to challenges from Russia and the Middle East and North Africa. This force-the Very High Readiness Joint Task Force (VJTF)- met its intended air, sea, and land deployment goals during NATO's Exercise \\\"Brilliant Jump\\\" in which 2,500 allied troops deployed from across Europe into Poland in May.  \\\"For NATO, it is a back to basics\\\" when it comes to deterrence, said Lute, \\\"but it is not a return to the Cold War.\\\"  The VJTF's rapid reaction capability will be complimented with a forward presence. \\\"This forward presence literally will begin in the north in Estonia and it will end up in the south in Bulgaria,\\\" said Lute.  An Atlantic Council report, \\\"Restoring the Power and Purpose of the NATO Alliance,\\\" urges NATO to permanently station troops in the Baltic States, Poland, and the Black Sea region. R. Nicholas Burns, an Atlantic Council board member who served as under secretary of state in the George W. Bush administration, and retired Gen. James L. Jones, Jr., chairman of the Atlantic Council's Brent Scowcroft Center on International Security and a former national security advisor in the Obama administration, are the authors of the report.  NATO plans to deploy four combat battalions in Poland and the three Baltic States: Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. The United States will lead the NATO battalion in Poland.  In May, US military officials inaugurated a missile interceptor site in Romania, which will be part of a larger missile defense shield. Romania will also host a multinational NATO brigade.  In June, NATO conducted a series of major\"}"
