ADST conducts oral history interviews with retired U.S. diplomats, and uses their accounts to form narratives around specific events or concepts, in order to further the study of American diplomatic history and provide the historical perspective of those directly involved.  The English Channel has often proven to be more than just a geographic barrier; Britain has always seen itself as distinct from the rest of the continent. However, in the shadow of World War II, as the continent realized the need for greater political and economic cooperation, the British ruling elite shifted towards more integration. In 1961, Britain applied for membership of the European Economic Community (EEC). French President Charles de Gaulle was concerned that British membership would weaken the French voice within Europe, and decided to express veto power with a resounding \\\"non.\\\" He also feared that close Anglo-American relations would lead to the United States increasing its influence in Europe. Charles de Gaulle thus vetoed a second application from Britain in 1969. Soon after President de Gaulle resigned, the new French Conservative Prime Minister, Edward Heath, accepted the UK into the EEC in January 1973, along with Denmark and Ireland, which expanded total membership to nine countries. The European Monetary System (EMS) was created in 1979 in an effort spread currency stability throughout Europe by encouraging countries to coordinate their monetary policies. Britain was the only EEC Member not to join the ERM.  Advertisement  On June 23, 2016, Britons by a narrow margin voted to leave the EU, or to \\\"Brexit\\\" as it is more commonly known. While many experts blame the results on growing nationalism, frustration with migration from other, poorer EU countries, and general opaqueness and bureaucracy from the EU, Euroskepticism has been present since Britain joined the EEC.  This account was compiled from interviews done by ADST with Arthur Hartman (interviewed beginning in October 1999), Deputy Chief of Mission to the European Economic Community in the 1960s, and Susan Klingaman (beginning May 1998), who covered the EEC from the State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research (INR) from 1970-72.

Johannes  HARTMAN: Today, the European Union and the USA have the largest bilateral trade partnership in the world, and our cooperation with Europe has been the basis for our foreign policy for the last fifty years. We wanted to create strong European unity, which would only happen if Great Britain joined the EEC and did not try to undermine it. [Under Secretary] George [W. Ball] sent me to Europe so that I could announce [British Prime Minister Harold] Macmillan's serious commitments to apply for membership in the EEC.  I first went to Brussels to meet with our representative to the EEC, Walt Butterworth, who was known at that time for being skeptical of British intentions to join the Common Market....[President John] Kennedy felt the British earnestly wanted to get in and that they should be taken seriously.  Advertisement  I had to speak with Butterworth first to get him in line because he too suspected the British of wanting in for the wrong reasons. He thought that perhaps the British wanted to integrate the EEC and water it down for it to become a free\"}"
