He wants it.  Asian automakers and Indian conglomerates are against it.  A vote in favor of exiting the EU (currently too close to call) could end Game of Thrones.  Good BBC cheat-sheet here.  CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC: In 2013, the West stood back and watched as French-speaking Central African Republic-which is 76 percent mostly Protestant Christian-fell to a well-armed and heavily funded alliance of Arabic-speaking jihadists. Now the country is awash in competing militias, with Christians caught in the crossfire: More than 250 have been abducted in the first three months of this year.  IRAQ: Fighting Islamic State in Fallujah is not a zero-sum game, as this article suggests. But Iraq's divided Sunnis will have to be brought alongside the fight in order for the country to have a future.  The American aid group Preemptive Love Coalition continues to bring aid to the estimated 90,000 Fallujah residents in dire need-100,000 pounds of aid delivered over the weekend, I have been told.
