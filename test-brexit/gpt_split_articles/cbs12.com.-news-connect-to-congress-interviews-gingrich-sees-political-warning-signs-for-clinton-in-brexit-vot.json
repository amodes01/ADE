"{\"uid\": \"cbs12.com.-news-connect-to-congress-interviews-gingrich-sees-political-warning-signs-for-clinton-in-brexit-vot\", \"text\": \"The vote by the British public to leave the European Union last week suggests presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton is out of step with public sentiment, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich said Monday.  According to Gingrich, the \\\"Brexit\\\" vote and similar developments in other countries represent an \\\"unlocking\\\" in Europe and the U.S. where citizens are saying that their social contract with the government no longer works. That trend has fueled outsiders and nationalist candidates like presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump and damaged more traditional politicians.  \\\"Hillary's got to really think through where she is right now strategically because she's offering continuity,\\\" Gingrich said in an interview Monday.    If Trump is seen as the agent of change and Clinton as the candidate of the status quo, that could be \\\"devastating\\\" for her, given the current mood of the public. She may need to reposition herself instead as \\\"the agent of effective change,\\\" he said.  Former Rep. Patrick Kennedy, who was appearing with Gingrich to promote , said the U.S. political system was intended to provide freedom while also protecting the people from destructive impulses that can lead to chaos or even genocide.  \\\"We do not want that in our country,\\\" Kennedy said. \\\"We need to have a system where we can have healthy debate, but a system that protects our country and does not allow our country to devolve into utter chaos.\\\"    Gingrich, who is often mentioned as a potential vice presidential candidate, did not offer a definitive answer when asked if he would agree to be Trump's running mate.  \\\"If it was a serious offer with a serious post-election opportunity to influence government, you could not as a patriot turn that down,\\\" he said. \\\"If it's just 'be the guy who goes to funerals,' you could turn that down.\\\"  Gingrich predicted questions about foreign donations to the Clinton Foundation while Hillary was secretary of state and other ethical concerns will continue to hound her campaign throughout the race.    \\\"None of this is going to go away,\\\" he said.  He also considered how Clinton's husband, the 42nd president, will handle being the first male First Spouse in the White House.  \\\"The whole idea is almost worth electing her just to be able to watch the circus of Bill Clinton wandering around as First Spouse,\\\" Gingrich said with a laugh.  \\\"I am less worried about Bill Clinton as First Spouse than Donald Trump as president,\\\" Kennedy responded. \\\"That's a real circus.\\\"  Despite the talk of immigration and economics, Gingrich said the Brexit vote was ultimately a British repudiation of control by European Union bureaucrats in Brussels, an attitude that may also be reflected in the U.S. on Election Day.    \\\"If the overwhelming issue in this country becomes Washington bureaucrats, Trump will have a great evening.\\\"\"}"
