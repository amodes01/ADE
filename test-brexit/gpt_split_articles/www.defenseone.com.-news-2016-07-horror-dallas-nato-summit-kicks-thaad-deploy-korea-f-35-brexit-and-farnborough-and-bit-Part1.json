She was writing, of course, about this: \\\"Two snipers shot and killed four Dallas police officers and a DART officer Thursday night during a protest downtown. Seven other officers and two civilians were wounded in a coordinated attack during the demonstration against recent shootings of black men by police in Louisiana and Minnesota.\\\" (Read continuing coverage of the attack from the Morning News, here.)  Continued Floyd: \\\"This is terrorism. This is what terrorists do. It is not a war - not black against blue, or us against them. When a reported two gunmen opened fire Thursday night on police officers, on our police officers, they attacked us all.\\\"  Brexit casts its shadow on NATO Summit. USA Today: \\\"President Obama and leaders of the European Union tried to put to rest any concerns that the United Kingdom's Brexit referendum would lead to further disintegration in Europe Friday, as they kicked off a two-day summit of NATO leaders.

Following our Strategic Defence and Security Review last year, we are investing $250 billion over the next decade in modern and capable Armed Forces.\\\" Read that, here.  What's on the table in Warsaw? Nothing less than the most important decisions in 25 years, according to Ivo Daalder, a former U.S. ambassador to NATO. \\\"The task of NATO leaders is to put in place policies and processes that respond to this triple challenge to Europe's security in ways that are clearly understood by the alliance's adversaries and supported by increasingly restive publics on both sides of the Atlantic. It is a tall task, indeed.\\\" Details here.  But can NATO's members come together? \\\"What are countries looking for from Warsaw? Unsurprisingly, many nations are going in with their own agendas, driven primarily by regional focuses,\\\" writes Defense News. \\\"Norway, for example, is looking for a focus on the High North region of Europe that could be imperiled by Russian naval forces\\u2026\\\" Read on, here.
