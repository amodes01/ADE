And you see it in Europe, all over Europe.\\\"  And while Scotland itself voted overwhelmingly to remain in the European Union, Trump is right. Right-wing nationalist movements, fueled by anger toward political elites and mistrust of immigration - and primarily backed by white voters - are gaining more and more momentum on the continent.  \\\"This is not a unique phenomenon to the United States, and 2016 is not a short moment that will pass,\\\" says Yascha Mounk, who teaches political theory at Harvard University and has studied the rise of nationalist movements. \\\"This is a real populist turn that has been happening for the last 15 or 20 years.\\\"  In recent decades, nationalist movements have shifted from vocal minorities to powerful parties that gained control of governments in places like Hungary, have lost national elections by the slimmest of margins in countries like Austria, and, this week, forced the United Kingdom out of the European Union.  Mounk pegs economic stagnation among lower- and middle-class whites as a main driver for nationalism's rise around the globe. \\\"You have a socially descending middle class that has not had real gains in the standard of living in 30 years,\\\" he said. \\\"And at the same time, you seem to have real improvements in social status, if not necessarily economic status, for ethnic minorities. So they feel like our country is being taken away.\\\"  Add to that mix an immigration and refugee crisis tied to Syria's civil war, which has flooded European countries, especially, with scores of migrants looking for jobs, social-services protections and housing.  While each movement has its own unique characteristics, there are many similarities that are fueling nationalism in the United States, the U.K. and other European nations.  A contempt for the elite ruling classes  \\\"People feel, quite rightly, that they have no real control over political systems - that the political class does what it wants and it sort of ignores ordinary people,\\\" Mounk says. \\\"And to a large extent, that's because of the necessities of globalization.\\\"  The contempt was clear in the victory speech of Nigel Farage, the head of the U.K. Independence Party and a leading voice in the long push for the U.K. to disassociate from the EU.  \\\"This will be a victory for the real people, a victory for the ordinary people,\\\" he said early Friday morning when it was clear the Leave campaign had won the referendum. \\\"We have fought against the multinationals. We fought against the big merchant banks. We fought against big politics.\\\"  Trump has sounded similar calls throughout his campaign.  \\\"We will never be able to fix a rigged system by counting on the same people who have rigged it in the first place,\\\" Trump said earlier this week, adding, \\\"It's rigged by big donors, who want to keep wages down. It's rigged by big businesses who want to leave our country.\\\"  While the feeling has largely gone mainstream in recent years - both of those quotes could have been said by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders - anti-elite sentiments have been a key part of nationalist parties' persona for decades.  Blaming immigrants  After the ISIS-inspired mass shooting in San\"}"
