"{\"uid\": \"www.salon.com.-2016-06-25-globalization-and-its-discontents-how-the-trumpbrexit-movements-might-herald-new-world-o\", \"text\": \"passage from Walt Whitman's \\\"Song of Myself,\\\" where he ticks off the noise and activity of a country teeming with industrial growth. Except that Trump is not a bard, he is a construction guy, first and foremost, as he himself readily admits. And no one argues that America's infrastructure is not crumbling. Even the opening of Trump's speech, a full-throated rant against corporate globalism, is a rhetorical Mobius strip that runs right into Bernie Sanders:  That's why we are asking Bernie Sanders' voters to join our movement: so together we can fix the system for ALL Americans. Importantly, this includes fixing all of our many disastrous trade deals. Because it's not just the political system that's rigged. It's the whole economy. It's rigged by big donors who want to keep down wages. It's rigged by big businesses who want to leave our country, fire our workers, and sell their products back into the U.S. with absolutely no consequences for them. It's rigged by bureaucrats who are trapping kids in failing schools. It's rigged against you, the American people.  Throughout his campaign, Trump's rhetoric has been vilified as racist, sexist, nativist and populist, depending upon the audience and the crisis. Reductive explanations are always problematic in that they ignore previous historical forces in play when technology, shifts in demographics, wealth disparity and immigration have given rise to similar \\\"movements\\\" of leaders with nativist tones.  Recently, two scholars from Oxford University, Ian Goldin and Chris Kutarna, published an audacious text about the lessons that could be drawn from the dislocation and demographic shifts that occurred during the Renaissance, a period of rapid advancement much like our own today. They argue the upheaval at the time due to technology led to a politics whose complexion is very similar to ours today.  \\\"Now, like then, new media have democratized information exchange, amplifying voices of those who feel they have been injured in the upheaval, said Goldin. In a column by Thomas Friedman, who reviews the book, he goes on to show how this turbulence led to the rise of an obscure firebrand friar, Girolamo Savonarola. He quotes Goldin as writing that \\\"he and his zealous supporters, though a small minority, swept away the Medici establishment and seized control of the city's councils.\\\"  \\\"From there,\\\" the article continues, \\\"Savonarola launched an ugly campaign of public purification, introducing radical laws including laws against homosexuality, and attacked public intellectuals in an act of intimidation that history still remembers as the Bonfire of the Vanities. Savonarola was amongst the first to tap into the information revolution of the time, and while others produced long sermons and treatises, Savonarola disseminated short pamphlets, in what may be thought of as the equivalent of political tweets.\\\"  Trump, like the Brexiters, has been an American Savanorola throughout his unorthodox campaign, smashing the idols of party structure, ruling class and fixed horizons. Whatever one thinks of Trump, you have to acknowledge that he is better at masterminding his own narrative than the rest of the world appears willing to give him credit for.  This poses dangers for America. While the global elite stare aghast at the steamy ruins of its grand EU experiment, it will have to take more seriously the prospect of a Trump presidency. Those ambassadors I hosted all expressed concerns about the idea of Trump's America-first solipsism, which, in their eyes, would render the geopolitical future into a Jackson\"}"
