Doug Mataconis \\u00b7 \\u00b7 26 comments  After months of often bitter campaigning that exposed real, and somewhat unpalatable, divides in British politics, the citizens of the United Kingdom are headed to the polls as we speakS to decide their future as part of the European and, perhaps, much, much more:  Britons from the far Scottish isles to the tip of Gibraltar began casting their ballots Thursday in a historic referendum that could reshape Britain's place in Europe and radiate economic, political and security implications across the globe. After months of bitter campaigning that sharply divided the country over questions of immigration and identity, election day dawned with a cliffhanger. Among the five polls released on the eve of the vote, two showed a lead for \\\"in,\\\" two gave the edge to \\\"out\\\" and one forecast a tie. The final average of all polls was 50-50, with Britons evenly split over whether the country should exit the 28-member European Union. Although \\\"leave\\\" had been leading the polls as of last week, \\\"remain\\\" has caught up since pro-E.U. member of Parliament Jo Cox was fatally shot and stabbed last week, jolting the country and prompting calls for an end to some of the campaign's more hateful rhetoric. Voting takes place throughout the day on Thursday, and the results are expected early Friday (Thursday evening Eastern time). The referendum marks an existential decision that could dramatically reshape Britain's global role in a way not seen since London shed its empire after World War II.

A powerful selling point for many votes is the claim that a farewell to E.U. ties could give the country the latitude to dramatically reduce immigration, which has hit record highs as Poles, Hungarians, Romanians and others from across Europe have flocked to the relative prosperity of the British economy. \\\"I really think tomorrow can be independence day,\\\" former London mayor Boris Johnson told supporters Wednesday as he posed for photos with fishmongers and waved copies of the virulently anti-E.U. Sun newspaper. Pro-Brexit leaders used the hashtag #IndependenceDay on Twitter Thursday morning to exhort their followers to get out and vote for what they promise will be a liberation from Brussels bureaucrats. But opponents say a vote to leave could be a grievous \\u00adself-inflicted wound from which it would take years, if not decades, for Britain to recover. \\\"We do not solve our immigration challenge by leaving the European Union, but we do create a massive problem for our economy,\\\" Cameron told the BBC on the eve of the vote. \\\"This is irreversible. You can not jump out of the airplane then climb back in through the cockpit hatch.\\\" Most economic, political and defense authorities - including nearly all foreign leaders - have joined the call for Britain to stay, and they have issued dire warnings about the consequences of\"}"
