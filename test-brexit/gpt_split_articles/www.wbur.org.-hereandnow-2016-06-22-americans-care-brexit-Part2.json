On long term effects of a potential \\\"Brexit\\\"  \\\"What we would see is less trade, increased tariffs, reduced profits for US firms and ultimately reduced wages, and that's where the pain is. Right in the wallet.\\\"  On how the United States fared before the EU was created  \\\"Actually the United States did extremely well in the 1960s and then in the 1950s and 1960s after World War II because we did not have infrastructure to rebuild. We were the only industrialized economy that was still intact. So I think it's bit of a false positive to say, 'Oh things were great back then.' They were great at the expense of the world.\\\"  Guest  Diane Swonk, economist. She tweets @DianeSwonk.\"}"
