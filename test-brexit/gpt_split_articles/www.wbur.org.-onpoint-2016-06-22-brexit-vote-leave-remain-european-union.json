Fishmonger Dave Crosbie speaks to the Associated Press at the market in Havering's Romford street market in London. (Frank Augstein/AP)  An epic vote in Britain tomorrow to decide whether the U.K. will stay in the European Union or take the \\\"Brexit.\\\" Passions are running very high. A promising British politician last week murdered by a man shouting \\\"Britain First!\\\" There are real consequences waiting here. For Britain, for Europe. By extension, the United States, the West. This hour On Point, on the eve of Britain's vote, we talk with Lionel Barber of the Financial Times, Roger Cohen of the New York Times and the Daily Telegraph's Tim Stanley on \\\"Brexit.\\\" - Tom Ashbrook  Guests  Lionel Barber, editor of the Financial Times. (@lionelbarber)  Roger Cohen, columnist for the New York Times. Author of the book, \\\"The Girl From Human Street.\\\" (@NYTimesCohen)  Tim Stanley, historian and columnist for the Daily Telegraph. (@timothy_stanley)  From Tom's Reading List  Financial Times: Young people will be the losers if Britain opts for isolation - \\\"If the UK votes for Brexit, there will be - as with all political experiments - a variety of unintended consequences. Many of these will fall hardest on the most vulnerable, in particular the young.\\\"  New York Times: Jo Cox and Britain's Place in Europe - \\\"The European Union has been through a tough decade. It has been beset by the structural flaws of the euro and a weak response to the financial meltdown of 2008. It has faced the ongoing difficulties of absorbing former Communist bloc nations and the challenge of mass immigration. It needs reinvigoration - of a kind Britain could lead.\\\"  Daily Telegraph: Brexit is not about nostalgia. It's about ambition. Trust me, I am a historian - \\\"There is no historical case for leaving the EU. There is no historical case for staying in. That's because this is not an existential matter. It's a practical decision. Do you think your country is better off in or out? I think the latter. So I am voting for Brexit.\\\"\"}"
