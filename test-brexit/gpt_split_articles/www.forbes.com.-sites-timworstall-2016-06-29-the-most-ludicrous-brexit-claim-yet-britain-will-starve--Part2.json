The challenge would be to put in place a Plan B for quick implementation. The UK is  not self-sufficient. Supplies would be disrupted. The public is used to full  supermarket shelves. The pound sterling is widely expected to drop, so imports  would be more expensive, and reliance on world markets could raise prices, but  could also incentive new sources at home and abroad. One key sensitivity would be  fruit and vegetables. The UK is 40% reliant on EU imports for fruit and vegetables.  The population ought to be eating far more horticultural produce, but even at  current consumption levels, the capacity for disruption would be considerable for  both UK and EU. Defra ought to consider this a priority for its Plan B.  What disruption? Someone's not going to sell Sainsbury's a truck or two of potatoes because Britain has left the EU? Seriously, this entire concept is drivel.  And I am sorry but it gets worse than this. Yes, really, worse:  Like all affluent societies, the UK has experienced a slow but dramatic change in  food prices since World War 2. The average household expenditure on food has  dropped from around 25% of disposable income to under 10% today (more if eating  out is included). The 20% lowest income households spend proportionately more,  around 16%.[117] In 2014, the Food Research Collaboration published an  assessment of UK food prices. In that, we presented government data suggesting  that UK food prices were 14th equal in Europe, i.e. exactly in the mid-point of  cheapness/expensiveness.[135] However, tariffs on imports if the UK was outside  the EU might affect this situation.  Figure 6 gives the tariff rates that the Government suggests could be applied to UK  goods entering the EU in the event of a Brexit. These are significant compared with  the current zero tariff allowances.  Here is Figure 6:  Note this well. Those are the tariffs which Britain has to charge, while in the EU, on food coming from outside the EU. Food from inside the EU moves free of tariffs of course. Britain leaves the EU and thus does not have to charge those tariffs on non-EU food. And of course we do not have to charge tariffs on food from the EU either, this is all entirely up to us. And not charging tariffs on food imports into Britain is going to make food in Britain more expensive?  Dang, I want to find out what was in that bong, sounds like some really good stuff.  In their conclusion:  And precisely how will the UK sever food ties with its main source of food  imports?  No, really, they are assuming that if we are not in the EU then we will no longer buy EU food. Why on Earth anyone would believe something of such monstrous stupidity is beyond me to divine I am afraid but there we have it. We are all going to starve because Martin Schulz is not our Parliamentary President any more.  And now we return you to your regularly scheduled reality. Britain's food supply will, as it has done for a century and a half or so, be largely domestically based with some 40% or so being provided by foreigners who like the taste of our money. That we are inside or outside a particular method of European governance is going to make no difference to that at all. And the absence of that European governance system's external tariffs will all, most likely, make it cheaper to boot.  Finally, an anecdote. All Brits will be familiar with the Oxo brand, most with Fray Bentos meat pies. While both are now UK produced they started in Victorian times, as brands coming from the Uruguayan town of Fray Bentos. All those cattle roaming the pampas turned into\"}"
