As the Pound continues to suffer, investors are fast seeking havens, yet with the Swiss (who intervened on Friday) and Japanese (who likely will in July) central banks likely to devalue, the US dollar index has surged to a three month high. Coming in the midst of the summer holiday's this is a bitter pill to swallow for holiday makers heading off to the US, whose holiday just became 12% more expensive.    Thursday's vote should have been about what was right for the country, rather than the personalities behind each campaign. However, amid the confusion surrounding the consequences of a Brexit, it seems Westminster cares more about the political repercussions than the economic ones. Jeremy Corbyn will do well to weather this storm, as his carefully selected shadow cabinet falls by the wayside.    What we really need is some form of decisive action, as financial markets seek reassurance that things will be OK. What we look likely to get is two months of political infighting, followed by another 20 months of uncertainty as the new leader somehow attempts to secure a deal which appeals to the many facets of the leave campaign. This will all take time and in the meanwhile, investors and businesses are left to ponder what the potential impact will be of this monumental decision.\"}"
