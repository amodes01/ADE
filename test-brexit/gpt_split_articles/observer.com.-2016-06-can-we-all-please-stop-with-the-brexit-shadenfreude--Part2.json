The conservative vote was split 42% Remain to 58% Leave. Even the Left-leaning Scottish National Party defies an easy label as it tilts anti-tax since coming into power; although conservatives are her political enemies, SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon stood alongside Cameron. This all makes for a very strange set of alliances, especially if you are accustomed to America's cleaner divisions. Imagine, though, Bernie Sanders campaigning with Chris Christie against 30% of Hillary supporters, who happen to side with Ted Cruz. In America, this would never happen, but that's a rough approximation of where loyalties stood in Britain.  It's further complicated because one of the core issues is immigration, which is about the most vexing one of all, with as wide a range of policy disagreements as you can find. Americans are familiar with how complex and contentious immigration debates can be-so you'd think they'd cut the Brits some slack and be careful with charges of racism. Yes, some Leave voters were no doubt motivated by racism (although most EU migrants are not ethnic minorities) and there have been sad stories of xenophobic graffiti, even attacks following the vote. But another take on EU migration flips the racism argument on its head: some polls showed a third of ethnic minority voters supported Leave, among them South Asians most strongly.  Here's why: Because EU rules set no limits on EU migration, and Britain has been forced to restrict non-European immigration, Brits of Indian or Bangladeshi origin who voted Leave often did so because they felt EU rules ultimately discriminate against people from non-European backgrounds, even those from Commonwealth countries. Some felt an EU thumb on the scales in favor of white Europeans with few or no ties to Britain.  But that's not a large swath of voters. Many Brits were simply eager for more of a say in who can live and work in their country. Under EU rules, anyone from another EU country can live, work and receive benefits in another EU country-no work visas, no interviews-and it's difficult to deport EU criminals. That's the bargain, and it's one that many feel is a raw deal.  Cameron's own plea to the EU before the referendum was to allow Britain to require EU workers to live in Britain for four years before claiming certain benefits. He did not get these concessions, obviously, and now Britain will have to figure out its immigration policy from scratch. For Americans who are confused: Picture a situation in which America voted to force Congress to throw out all existing immigration laws and start from square one. Much as many might like such an outcome, it's going to cause some complex issues.  Then there is the notion that pulling out of the EU is a brave feat of free market capitalism. Even if it's painful now, it's worth it in the long run, the argument goes. It's undeniably painful in the short run: yes, UK markets did bounce back somewhat from the initial shock, but the pound is still at its lowest levels since the 80's and $130Bn was wiped out of the FTSE (with many companies holding pensions and savings) in two days - that's almost five times as much as UKIP's leader Nigel Farage famously claimed Britain gives away to Europe every year. Yes, Europe can have onerous, sometimes silly regulation, but Britain's economy has done very well within the EU, and is now growing as fast as the US with unemployment diving to just above 5%. Some of Europe's pro-market regulation goes so far as to stop Britain from putting up tariffs, preventing it from propping up an\"}"
