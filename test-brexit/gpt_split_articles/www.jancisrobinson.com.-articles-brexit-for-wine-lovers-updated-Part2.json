Andrew Nielsen of Le Grappin commented, 'being both a French winemaker and importer of our wines into the UK, the Brexit result is a catastrophe. In the long term there is huge uncertainty obviously, but in the short term our UK business could quickly become untenable well before Brexit happens. Burgundy and Beaujolais are already facing the toughest vintage that anyone can remember following vineyard damage from frost and hail, and now poor fruit set and disease pressure from a wet spring. Fruit prices in Burgundy are already double what they were in 2011 and it is hard to see that there will not be further increases for 2016 as a result. Combined with the poor exchange rate, we can easily see our Burgundy wines being priced out of what the market can bear. Our Beaune Premiers Crus at over \\u00a360 on the shelf at our retail partners is well within the realm of possibility. Currency volatility will mean that it would be prudent for us to allocate more of our production to our other importers, keeping more of our revenue in the currency where our costs are denominated. If 1.2 to the euro is the new normal, it is hard to see a way forward for our UK business, and that is before any hurdles put in our way from an actual Brexit. Here in Beaune this week, every person we chat to is sad and horrified by the decision the UK has made and we, in turn, have no answer for them.'  What will the divorce look like?  In an effort to get a better understanding of the potential outcomes of a Brexit agreement, I called Jean-Claude Piris, who used to be the legal advisor to the EU and advised on the likes of the Maastricht, Amsterdam, Nice and Lisbon treaties.  He suggested that 'any arrangements that are agreed between the EU and the UK following Brexit would be worse than the conditions for trade than they have now'. He said that the arrangements which are in place between the EU and both Switzerland and Norway, which have both been referred to as possible examples of how the UK deal could work, would not be acceptable to the EU. Indeed the EU is seeking to change the terms of the treaties with both Switzerland and Norway because they do not work as currently drafted. Instead, he referred to a 'free-trade agreement model', which does not mean 'free' trade, but a limited series of trade arrangements between the EU and a so-called 'third state'.  He referred to the EU arrangement agreed with Canada in February 2016, the 'Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement between the EU and Canada' (known as CETA) as the type of arrangement that could be put in place with the UK. The following is an excerpt from the CETA summary document, which states 'wines and spirits are the major export item of the EU agricultural and food industry to Canada. Tariff elimination is complemented by the removal of other trade barriers, including several behind-the-border barriers that have prevented the EU from substantially improving its performance in the Canadian market.'  Therefore it is likely that, owing to the importance of the UK for EU wine-producing countries, an agreement would be reached which would make EU wine competitive in the UK. The issue is timing.  Piris outlined the devil in the detail of the Lisbon Treaty. The EU cannot negotiate the terms of trade with a third state until it becomes a third state. In the case of the UK, this will not happen until two years after the UK triggers Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty [the necessary mechanism for beginning exit negotiations].  Therefore, technically the two years will be used to determine the legal arrangements for\"}"
