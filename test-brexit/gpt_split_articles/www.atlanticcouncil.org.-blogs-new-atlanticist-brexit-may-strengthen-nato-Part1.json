Vershbow spoke at the Atlantic Council's NATO Future Leaders Summit in Warsaw. He was joined in a panel discussion by Douglas Lute, the US permanent representative to NATO, and Alexandra de Hoop Scheffer, a senior transatlantic fellow at the German Marshall Fund. Damon Wilson, executive vice president for programs and strategy at the Atlantic Council, moderated the discussion. The conference was held a day before NATO leaders were to meet for their two-day summit in the Polish capital.  In a June 23 referendum, British voters backed a UK departure from the European Union, a so-called Brexit, by 52 percent to 49 percent. The results of the vote are nonbinding. Brexit negotiations with Brussels will only officially start once the British prime minister informs the European Council of the decision to leave the EU-thereby invoking Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. British Prime Minister David Cameron, who has announced his decision to step down in October, has said he will leave that invocation to his successor.  Vershbow acknowledged that if Brexit negotiations turn \\\"divisive\\\" and \\\"rancorous\\\" it would have some spillover onto deliberations in NATO. \\\"[NATO] Secretary General [Jens Stoltenberg] is certainly trying to underscore that if anything, NATO is now important than ever and that our unity and solidarity will have to sustain us through what will clearly be a difficult period for Europe,\\\" he said.  The UK and NATO  The UK is a significant contributor to NATO. It is one of five NATO member states that meets the goal of contributing two percent of its GDP to defense.  Lute noted that \\\"elements of continuity\\\"-the US relationship with the UK, the US relationship with the EU, and the UK's contributions to NATO-would remain even if the UK were to leave the European bloc. \\\"Those are cornerstones that remain,\\\" said Lute.  \\\"Clearly, inside the halls of NATO, the UK is a leader, it leads with its capabilities and we do not expect that to change,\\\" he added.  De Hoop Scheffer noted that while the vote for Brexit sends a troubling political message to other EU members states, it would have the minimal impact on the \\\"defense domain\\\" as bilateral defense cooperation-such as the Lancaster House Agreement between the UK and France-will continue.  In fact, the EU Global Strategy document rolled out in June advocates that Europe needs to develop its own military autonomy. \\\"When it comes to collective defense, NATO remains the primary framework for most member states\\\" but \\\"as Europeans we must take greater responsibility for our security,\\\" according to the document from EU foreign policy\"}"
