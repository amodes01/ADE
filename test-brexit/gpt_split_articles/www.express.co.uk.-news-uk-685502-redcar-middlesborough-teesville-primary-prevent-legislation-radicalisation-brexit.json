The boy's parents have expressed their outrage that their son was \\\"singled out\\\" by staff at Teesville primary school, Middlesborough. The father of the child, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said: \\\"We have been informed that they will be reported to the relevant authorities for radicalisation and being racist. \\\"The school in question was talking about how the exit from the EU would effect our country.  GETTY Theresa May has pushed forward the campaign to get schools working under Prevent legislation  \\\"My child said 'It would stop refugees and immigrants coming in or leaving the country' which has been said numerous times in the news and social media since the referendum result. \\\"One thing for certain is that my child, me or his mum are not racist in any way shape or form. \\\"We are fuming that the school has taken this action against our child who is the most caring and great child a father could want. \\\"We are not happy that they have been singled out in this way.\\\"  More than five schoolchildren are reported every day under the Government counter-terrorism legislation. Last year 1,041 youngsters were flagged up as at risk of being drawn into terrorism and were subsequently referred to authorities through the counter-extremism programme. The total - the equivalent of more than five per school day - represents a huge increase from the legislation's first year of nationwide operation in 2012, when just nine children were reported. The deputy head of Teesville Primary said the incident was \\\"a minor issue that was dealt with internally.\\\"  SUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you have consented to and to improve our understanding of you.
