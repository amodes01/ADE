That's how we won greater civil rights in the U.S., led Congress to cut off funding for the Vietnam war, and together we forced Reagan to begin the disarmament negotiations with Gorbachev. It's how the Berlin Wall was breached and Soviet colonialism was relegated to history's dustbin.  The challenge we face is to respond to NATO's imperialism and to the increasing dangers of great power war with the imagination and urgency required by our times.  The challenge we face is to respond to NATO's imperialism and to the increasing dangers of great power war with the imagination and urgency required by our times. Neither Poland and Russia nor Washington and Moscow will be living in harmony any time soon, but Common Security provides a path to such a future.  Common Security embraces the ancient truth that a person or a nation cannot be secure if their actions lead their neighbor or rival to be more fearful and insecure. At the height of the Cold War, when the 30,000 nuclear weapons threatened apocalypse, Swedish Prime Minister Palme brought together leading U.S., European and Soviet figures to explore ways to step back from the brink.29 Common Security was their answer. It led to the negotiation of the Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty, which functionally ended the Cold War in 1987.  In essence, each side names what the other is doing that causes it fear and insecurity. The second party does the same.

Negotiations to create a neutral Ukraine with regional autonomy for its provinces and economic ties to both Russia and the West would end that war and create a more secure foundation for improved relations between Europe and Russia and between the great powers. The Deep Cuts Commission recommends that enhancing the role of the OSCE is \\\"the single multilateral platform on which dialogue on relevant security concerns can and should be resumed without delay.\\\"31 In time it should replace NATO. Other Deep Cuts Commission recommendations include:  Giving priority to U.S.-Russian negotiations to restrain and address the intense military buildup and military tensions in the Baltic area.  \\\"[P]revent[ing] dangerous military incidents by establishing specific rules of conduct...and revive dialogue on nuclear risk reduction measures.\\\"  U.S. and Russia committing to resolve their differences of compliance with the INF Treaty and eliminating the growing dangers of nuclear-armed cruise missile development and deployments.  Addressing the growing danger of hyper-sonic strategic weapons.  And, while the Commission calls for restraint in nuclear weapons modernization, clearly our goal should be an end to the development and deployment of these omnicidal weapons.  With reduced military spending, Common Security also means greater economic security, with more money for essential social services, to contain and reverse the devastations of\"}"
