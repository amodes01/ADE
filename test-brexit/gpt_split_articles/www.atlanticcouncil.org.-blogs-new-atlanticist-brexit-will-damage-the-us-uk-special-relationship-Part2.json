This will not find eager partners on the Continent and is likely to engender even more resentment, as well as delay. A process of disentanglement that is expected to take no less than two years has not even formally started but it has clearly become a distraction in an area of the world where the focus needs to be on regenerating economic growth with millions of new and good jobs, dealing with a Russia gleeful at the site of Western disarray, and managing immigration with some sort of veneer of confidence at the very least. And this is not to mention the shared challenges in the Middle East and Asia. Perforce the time and energy available for cooperating with the United States on the big problems will be reduced significantly. The idea that the UK will have more ability to focus, much less spend, on NATO at this juncture is ill-considered wishful thinking.  The forces of political entropy that Brexit released will be at best unpredictable and at worst unthinkable. The Scots are not going to sit around and wait to become a disinherited spinster sister of England and Wales. The Scots see the benefits of continued EU membership but have been told in no uncertain terms by European powers (particularly those with their own semi-autonomous regions) that the EU will only negotiate with sovereign countries. Unlike the English, the Scots apparently believe they can retain their identity comfortably within a European context and they are already envisioning the need for another referendum on whether to remain in the UK.  But the legitimization of fear of foreigners that was critical to mobilizing Brexit's voters will now have a stronger base on the Continent as well. And that could turn out to be the worst possible contribution the English and Welsh will make in the twenty-first century. The big winners of the referendum were the retrograde/ insular/prejudiced/racist elements that found a home in Nigel Farage's UK Independence Party. And now even Farage, a man who clearly does not have the stomach to take any responsibility for the consequences of what he so strongly supported, has resigned from politics. He knows that the medium-term prospects for any economic benefits to accrue to his voting base are nil, and that is likely to stoke further the politics of fear and resentment.  Americans have a real stake in a Europe that is not only trying but is unreservedly devoted to preventing the horrors of two horrendous wars in Europe. The EU is not simply another convenient economic bloc. US President Barack Obama was absolutely correct in writing in the UK's Telegraph before the vote: \\\"The tens of thousands of Americans who rest in Europe's cemeteries are a silent testament to just how intertwined our prosperity and security truly are.\\\"  The notion that Europe is beyond the point where it could all fall apart once again is no less than a willfully ignorant reading of recent history. The startling fact that Cameron's decision to pursue the Brexit referendum was made without consultation with the other partner in the so-called special relationship-the United States-is telling enough. We can only hope that the next generation of UK leaders will feel some small obligation to rebuild ties with the United States and make them somehow special again.
