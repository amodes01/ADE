"{\"uid\": \"nationalinterest.org.-feature-after-brexit-america-must-let-go-more-europe-16765\", \"text\": \"WTO rules, and post-Brexit arrangements must not result in market access for the United States or other third parties worse than those currently in force and established by bargaining in the Uruguay round and previous GATT rounds. The United States should not take sides in the EU-UK negotiations on political grounds, but President Obama's vow that the UK must go to \\\"the back of the queue\\\" clearly must be dropped. If it proves advantageous to negotiate a free trade agreement with the UK and London is interested, Washington should go for it, much as it has with Chile, Israel and any number of other countries.  The United States needs to reengage with NATO, a process already underway in response to tensions with Russia. The old quad mechanism within the alliance of the United States, UK, France and Germany could be reactivated, possibly with enlargement to Italy and Poland.  Washington should look for opportunities to enhance its foreign-policy and security dialogue with Europe, the prospects for which might improve with Britain out of the Union. Cooperation between the EU and NATO has long been hampered by fear in Europe about its supposed threat to the EU's foreign-policy autonomy. Dialogue might actually be enhanced in a forum that includes the United States, Britain, the EU (however it chose to be represented), Canada and someday, it is to be hoped, a less hostile and more democratic Russia.  The United States needs to stop pressing the EU to enlarge, especially to Turkey. The voters clearly do not want it, and to insist that they must accept it against their will is to risk further damage to the EU while doing nothing for Turkey. The same logic must apply to Moldova, Ukraine, Georgia and any number of other countries that pose challenges, which at various times U.S. officials have hoped could be \\\"solved\\\" through the deus ex machina of EU accession.\"}"
