Again, it's uncertain what impact Brexit will have here, but as the EU and the US have yet to agree a final text or indeed what the scope of Privacy Shield and how it will work, that's a moot point perhaps. Neville-Rolfe says:  Throughout the negotiations, the UK Government has been urging both the Commission and the US to conclude negotiations on this new legally robust adequacy decision, in order to provide clarity to the businesses that transfer data from the EU to the US, and to reassure citizens that their rights will be upheld in the new agreement. All of our discussions with the Commission and the US have recognised the need to strike the balance between commercial interests and fundamental rights.  Neville-Rolfe explains that there will be more to say in the government's digital strategy, but that it \\\"would be imprudent\\\" to forecast its exact timing. But in uncertain times, she urges a need to \\\"unleash economic dynamism\\\" to counter any Brexit downturn. This includes tapping into the Internet of Things as a booster for the economy:  If political events were less exciting I could have waxed lyrical and long about the Internet of Things, how we are going to see exponential growth of ordinary objects and devices connected to the internet. Many of these devices are already on the market and in time nearly all products and services will have a digital element. This is a huge opportunity for Britain at home and overseas with its strength in digital, its creative, innovative people and strong universities to keep up the flow of new ideas and IP.  Her conclusion is simple:  To quote the Chinese proverb we 'live in interesting times'. The essentials are I suggest first, that the explosive growth in digital developments of all kinds will continue apace and second that the need to protect citizens' interests and data will remain a priority. But how we achieve the latter objective has got a little more difficult.  My take  A lucid exploration of the data protection and data transfer limbo in which the UK - and Europe - finds itself in. No answers, but lots of questions. A very Brexit-situation. But this is an area in which the government needs to get its party-line sorted out fast.\"}"
