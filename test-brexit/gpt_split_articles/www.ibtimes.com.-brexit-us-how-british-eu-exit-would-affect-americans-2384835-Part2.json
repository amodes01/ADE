Brexit Opinion Polling: Remain vs. Leave | Graphiq  3. Tariffs could rise for certain products. If the U.K. leaves the EU, trade deals and policies would have to be renegotiated. For U.S. businesses that have treated Britain as their gateway to the EU, this could mean an increase in tariffs to gain access to European markets once the EU no longer counts the United Kingdom among its members.  \\\"There will likely be tariffs to pay for cross-border market access,\\\" Matthew Beesley, head of global equities for Henderson Global Investors, told CNBC. \\\"It is to be negotiated, so we just do not know.

The United Kingdom has long been the bridge between the U.S. and the European continent - militarily, diplomatically and economically.

If the U.K. votes against a Brexit, the U.S. does not have to contemplate that possibility. But it will have to wait until the early hours of Friday to find out.\"}"
