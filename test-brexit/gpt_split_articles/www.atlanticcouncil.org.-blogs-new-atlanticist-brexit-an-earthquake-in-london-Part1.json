It should, instead, set off alarm bells about the future of the European project.  British Prime Minister David Cameron's campaign to keep the United Kingdom in the EU was defeated by 52 percent to 48 percent despite overwhelming support from voters in Scotland, Northern Ireland, and London. The United Kingdom must now negotiate its exit from the EU under the terms of Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. These negotiations could last up to two years-thereby creating a period of uncertainty for global financial markets and political sentiment on the European continent.  Peter Westmacott, a former British ambassador to the United States, described the outcome of the so-called Brexit referendum on June 23 as an \\\"earthquake.\\\"  \\\"We have a lot of work to do in the United Kingdom in terms of limiting the damage and restoring the confidence\\\" in the United Kingdom as being a good place to invest, he added.    The vote's repercussions will be felt across Europe, said Natalie Nougayrede, a columnist with the Guardian. \\\"It would be a serious mistake to think that this is one isolated demonstration of rejection of the European project,\\\" she said.  \\\"There are forces at work on the continent that will benefit from this vote. They are already making that very, very clear,\\\" she added. The leaders of far-right, anti-immigrant political parties across Europe have been quick to welcome the outcome of the British vote.  Nougayrede and Westmacott spoke on a conference call hosted by the Atlantic Council on June 24. They were joined by Richard L. Morningstar, founding director and chairman of the Atlantic Council's Global Energy Center and a former US ambassador to the European Union. Claire Yorke, a nonresident senior fellow at the Council's Brent Scowcroft Center on International Security moderated the call.  If European leaders now say that they will continue with the European project, \\\"it simply will not do the trick,\\\" said Nougayrede. \\\"There has to be a deep rethink, literally a rebuilding of the European project from ground up, not from top down.\\\"  \\\"It would be delusional to start thinking about deepening integration,\\\" she said.  Noting that a concerted effort needs to be made to restore the connection between the European project and citizens across the European Union, she added: \\\"This is going to be a very big task because we have been in denial for many years.\\\"  Morningstar agreed. \\\"This has to be a wake-up call to the EU,\\\" he said. \\\"Any idea of rushing into further integration, at this point anyway, is not going to help. The EU and Brussels have to work with the member states to develop more transparency, to develop more confidence among the citizenry of these states. But at the end of the day that is only going to happen if the EU comes up with the right policies and does not come across as overly technocratic and bureaucratic, and addresses some of the legitimate grievances that have come up as part of this debate.\\\"  The referendum  The outcome of the British referendum is \\\"partly about a sense in the United Kingdom that the institutions of the European Union are not working properly, even though the United Kingdom is insulated from the effects of what is going on in Europe,\\\" said Westmacott.  Westmacott said the Leave campaign had resorted to a campaign of misinformation, including baseless warnings about Turkey being on the brink of joining the EU, which would flood the United Kingdom with Turkish immigrants.\"}"
