I am scared,\\\" said Arseniy Yatsenyuk at the Atlantic Council on June 30.  In one of his first public appearances in Washington since stepping down as Ukraine's prime minister on April 14, Yatsenyuk urged Europe to get its act together.  Brexit, he said, is a \\\"huge geopolitical crisis\\\": The United Kingdom's exit from the EU could split the union, weaken Europe, trigger a domino effect and undermine trust and confidence in the European idea among Ukrainians. \\\"We need a united Europe,\\\" he said.  Like other reformers, Yatsenyuk is counting on Ukrainians' strong desire to join Europe as a means to incentivize continued legislative reform and clean up the country.  Ukraine has another stake in the EU game, as well, Yatsenyuk pointed out. The EU will extend its punishing sanctions on Russia, although there are early indications that it may not renew them when they expire in January 2017.  \\\"Mr. President [Barack Obama] and the EU leaders, you are not allowed to lift sanctions against Russia until Russia fully implements Minsk [cease-fire agreement]. And until Ukraine takes over control of Luhansk, Donetsk, and Crimea. Full stop,\\\" Yatsenyuk said. \\\"We are not just fighting for our borders....We are fighting for European borders, and for NATO member states' borders, too. And for peace and stability in Europe.\\\"  After speaking extemporaneously from the podium for 10 minutes, Yatsenyuk took questions from the audience for 50 minutes. His charisma and charm were matched by an intense delivery style and numerous facts.  He laid out his successes as prime minister between February 2014 and April 2016, noting that his government faced tremendous challenges. On his watch, Ukraine got its finances under control, cleaned up its corrupt energy sector and took meaningful steps toward energy independence, established new anti-corruption bodies and reformed the patrol police-all while holding the Russians at bay.  \\\"We deterred Russian forces.... We built up a new army. We are the only country in Europe which is fighting against a well-equipped, armed-to-the-teeth Russian army,\\\" he noted.  The former prime minister did not shy away from Ukraine's notorious corruption problem. \\\"It's true that corruption exists.... We did a lot to decrease the level of corruption,\\\" Yatsenyuk said, outlining his government's actions in that area.  The government made an effort to reduce the power of oligarchs, he claimed, including Dmytro Firtash, Rinat Akhmetov and Ihor Kolomoisky. Critics will be quick to point out, however, that these efforts were mere slaps on the wrist; all of the men maintain a strong influence in Ukraine's parliament and Ukraine's media is still owned by oligarchs.  He explained that new anti-corruption bodies have been established and have begun investigations into top-level officials. However, no high-level officials from the Yanukovych regime or any since the\"}"
