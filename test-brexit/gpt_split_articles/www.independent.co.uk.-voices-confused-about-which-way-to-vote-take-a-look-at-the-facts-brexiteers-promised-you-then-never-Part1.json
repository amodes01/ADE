Read our privacy policy  Winston Churchill's delightful quote, \\\"the best argument against democracy is a five minute conversation with the average voter\\\" could never be more apposite when it comes to the EU referendum. Moreover, the average voter could be forgiven for replying, \\\"The best argument against democracy is a five-minute conversation with the average politician.\\\" What should have been an intelligent debate on the pros and cons of remaining in Europe has been dumbed down to a shouting match and desperate confirmation bias - the search and use of data to prove the point one believes in, coupled with an infinite capacity to ignore or refuse to listen to any counter arguments.  John Major came closest to presenting an honest case when he said that he was \\\"no starry eyed Europe enthusiast but had no doubt that the UK should remain in the EU\\\". The decision whether or not to remain hinges on making a large number of often complex trade-offs, ideally based on facts. I too have ended up firmly in favour of remaining.  Put simply, the Leave campaign has failed completely to convince me that the balance of advantage lies in quitting. No positive case has been made and no substantive counter arguments to the risks and uncertainties of leaving have been provided. Dismissing alternative points of view from credible independent experts as Cameron-sponsored collusion is schoolboy stuff and insulting to the average voter.  The Leave campaign now seems to be focusing on two issues: firstly, immigration - \\\"We need to control our borders\\\" - and secondly, sovereignty - \\\"We need to control our own laws\\\". They have lost the economic argument (more on that later). Moreover, their logic on immigration and sovereignty is fatally flawed and misleading.  Contrary to voter expectations, at no time has the Leave campaign argued that Brexit will result in lower immigration from the EU. Their rhetoric suggests they favour the prospect of an Australian-style points system to decide whom we would allow to enter the country. This is a seductive proposition but dangerously misleading when viewed in isolation or out of context. First, the statistical truth: 27.3 per cent of Australia's population is foreign born compared to 12.3 per cent in the UK. So what Leave is really saying is that the number of EU immigrants coming to the UK might not change with Brexit but that labour markets are inefficient and that Government is better placed to decide what skills we need and do not need. Putting aside my cynicism that Government knows better than employers with free access to EU labour skills, the facts do not support this case.  Employers thus far have done an excellent job at taking advantage of access to EU skills - and the UK as a country has benefited. 78 per cent of EU immigrants are in work in the UK compared to 73 per cent of the rest of the population. Moreover, the value of these immigrants to the UK economy is well documented by detailed research by Christian Dustmann, University College London (born in Herford, Germany) and Tomas Frattini, University of Milan (born in Bergamo, Italy), neither of whom can be dismissed as \\\"Remain stooges\\\". Their study showed that between 1995 and 2011, migrants made a positive contribution of more than \\u00a34bn to\"}"
