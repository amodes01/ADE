Last year, half or more in Germany, France, and Italy said their country should not use force to defend a NATO ally that got into a conflict with Russia.  Moreover, Europeans are still wary of America's power and reach. Obama's increased use of drone strikes has met with widespread opposition. And Edward Snowden's revelations about NSA eavesdropping exposed a whole new dimension of U.S. power, generating a new set of fears about an American cyber superpower extending its electronic reach across the globe. The Snowden story damaged America's reputation for respecting individual liberty in Europe, especially in Germany, where the U.S. allegedly tapped Chancellor Angela Merkel's cellphone. There is still an undercurrent of distrust of American power in European minds, even with popular president in the White House.  Attitudes toward likely Republican nominee Donald Trump are stunningly negative: A median of just 9 percent have confidence in him.  America's image is deeply impacted by who sits in the Oval Office. Obama's chosen successor, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, does not receive his sky-high ratings, but she is mostly well-received among Europeans. Across the 10 EU nations polled, a median of 59 percent express confidence in the presumptive Democratic nominee. In contrast, attitudes toward likely Republican nominee Donald Trump are stunningly negative: A median of just 9 percent have confidence in him, and his ratings actually look quite similar to Bush's when he left office. In 2008, at least eight-in-10 in Spain, France, Germany, and the U.K. lacked confidence in Bush, and more than eight-in-10 in these countries say the same about Trump today.  As the Economist's Lexington column recently noted, Trump seems to embrace many of the things that generated so much hostility toward the U.S. during the Bush years, such as an America-first unilateralism and using waterboarding and worse to fight terrorists. It is, writes Lexington, as if \\\"the caricature of America that so much of the world hated from 2001 to 2008 is Mr. Trump's pitch.\\\"  The last decade and a half has shown how quickly European attitudes toward the U.S. can change. There are many different facets to the reputation of the world's dominant superpower - soft power, military power, economic power - and regardless of who wins in November, Europeans will continue to look across the Atlantic with some mixture of admiration and trepidation. Still, the outcome of the election will likely have a big impact on the balance between esteem and fear.  Richard Wike is director of Global Attitudes Research at the Pew Research Center.\"}"
