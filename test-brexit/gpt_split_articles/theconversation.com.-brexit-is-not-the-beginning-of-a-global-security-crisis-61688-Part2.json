Whatever they need from Russia, the leaders of the other 27 member states do not wish to encourage their looming neighbour's expansion plans, and the UK will remain a heavyweight partner in their efforts to deter it. Even now, Britain is engaged in a significant military exercise in Poland and deterring actions against the Baltic States in particular.  More broadly, by refocusing on NATO and the transatlantic partnership, Britain might have inadvertently kicked off a long-overdue reconsideration of Europe-wide defence commitments and spending. While the US-UK relationship (\\\"special\\\" or otherwise) may never look the same, its security dimension will most likely endure. As will the defence business, for that matter: Britain's BAE Systems is a very significant player in the US defence market, and is currently one of the top international sellers to the US government - selling more to the Pentagon than it does to the UK's own Ministry of Defence.  So even as the direction and integrity of both the UK and the EU are called into question as never before, there is just no real reason to expect new direct security threats in the short and medium-term. The coming adjustments and realignments will have implications for Europe and beyond, but doomy predictions of global or regional insecurity are (for now at least) gross exaggerations.\"}"
