A federal Europe was the magic bullet that would make unnecessary the permanent stationing of U.S. troops in Europe. Reinforced by his own admiration for Monnet, John Foster Dulles backed the ill-fated European Defense Community long after it had any chance of becoming a reality. While enthusiastically supporting the Common Market, notwithstanding the economic discrimination that lay at the heart of the enterprise, Dulles declined to back a British proposal for a wider European Free Trade Agreement intended to head off the UK's isolation from the continent.  The Kennedy administration was even more single-minded in its pursuit of integration along federalist lines. Led by Under Secretary of State George W. Ball, Monnet's American lobbyist and lawyer, the United States pressured the UK to apply for membership in the European Community. The administration expunged the \\\"Atlantic Community\\\" from its vocabulary in favor of an \\\"Atlantic Partnership,\\\" said to be composed of two equals, the United States and an enlarged EC. To advance the partnership, the administration proposed special U.S.-EC trade arrangements and cooked up a crazy scheme, the Multilateral Nuclear Force, which it was hoped would promote the federation of Europe and encourage Britain and France to abandon their national nuclear arsenals. In the end the EC rejected the trade agreement, the MLF collapsed under its own weight and French president Charles de Gaulle vetoed Britain's bid for EC membership.  The Johnson administration picked up the pieces of what Ball had called the \\\"Grand Design\\\" by reforming NATO and patching relations with Britain and West Germany. Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger later sought to inject a new flexibility into U.S. policy by building bridges to de Gaulle. But patterns had been set, de Gaulle soon left the scene and Kissinger was frustrated in his attempt to negotiate a \\\"New Atlantic Charter.\\\" Subsequent administrations came to support any advance on integration emanating from Brussels, a trend that reached its apogee in the post-Cold War 1990s, as the United States urged the EU to expand faster and further to the east and southeast and cheered on the march to the disastrous euro.  This era is now over. There is no going back to the past, although it is worth asking whether any of the alternative orders that the United States so fiercely opposed-some variant of de Gaulle's Europe des patries or of Harold Macmillan's European Free Trade Area-might have been preferable to the outcome we now have. The original Europe of the Six, now threatened by the likes of Geert Wilders and Marine Le Pen, might have progressed to a genuine federal union with all its advantages. Beyond, a looser, more differentiated area would have muted the existential importance of \\\"in\\\" versus \\\"out.\\\" There might have been less need for the centralized bureaucracy that the voters so detest. Russia, a European country that finds no place in Europe, could have been accommodated more easily following the collapse of communism.  But all this is food for historical speculation. Today, there is much that needs to be done.  The economic agencies of the U.S. government should be in overdrive. Setting the terms for UK-EU trade in the post-Brexit world is not a strictly bilateral matter, and still less a unilateral decision by which the EU dictates the terms of divorce. Trade agreements concluded by the EU and the UK are subject to\"}"
