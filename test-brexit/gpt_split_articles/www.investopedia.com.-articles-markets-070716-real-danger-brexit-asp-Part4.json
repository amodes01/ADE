Another possibility would be to use the pound, which would mean forfeiting control over monetary policy.  Upsides for Some  On the other hand, a weak currency that floats on global markets can be a boon to U.K. producers that export goods. Industries that rely heavily on exports could actually see some benefit.  In 2024, the top 10 exports from the U.K. were (in U.S. dollars):  Precious metals: $63.5 billion Motor vehicle manufacturing: $28.8 Aircraft, engines, and parts manufacturing: $27.4 billion Petroleum refining: $21.4 billion Pharmaceuticals preparations manufacturing: $15.4 billion Crude petroleum and natural gas extraction: $12.8 billion Off-road vehicle manufacturing: $8.9 billion Measuring, testing, and navigational equipment manufacturing: $8.4 billion Spirit Production: $6.9 billion  Whiskey production: $5.8 billion  Some sectors were prepared to benefit from the exit. Multinationals listed on the FTSE 100 saw earnings rise as a result of a soft pound. A weak currency was also a boon to the tourism, energy, and service industries.  In May 2016, the State Bank of India, India's largest commercial bank, suggested that Brexit would benefit India economically. While leaving the eurozone meant that the U.K. no longer had unfettered access to Europe's single market, it would allow for more focus on trade with India. India would also have more wiggle room if the U.K. were no longer under European trade rules and regulations.  U.K.-EU Trade After Brexit  May advocated a \\\"hard Brexit.\\\" By that, she meant that Britain should leave the EU's single market and customs union and negotiate a trade deal to govern their future relationship. These negotiations would have been conducted during a transition period once a divorce deal was ratified.  The Conservatives' poor showing in the June 2017 snap election called popular support for a hard Brexit into question. Many in the press speculated that the government could take a softer line. The Brexit White Paper released in July 2018 revealed plans for a softer Brexit. It was too soft for many MPs in her party and too audacious for the EU.  The white paper said the government planned to leave the EU single market and customs union. However, it proposed the creation of a free trade area for goods, which would \\\"avoid the need for customs and regulatory checks at the border and mean that businesses would not need to complete costly customs declarations. And it would enable products to only undergo one set of approvals and authorizations in either market, before being sold in both.\\\" This meant the U.K. would follow EU single-market rules regarding goods.  The white paper acknowledged that a borderless customs arrangement with the EU-one that allowed the U.K. to negotiate free trade agreements with third countries-was \\\"broader in scope than any other that exists between the EU and a third country.\\\"  The government was correct that there was no example of this kind of relationship in Europe. The four broad precedents that existed were the EU's relationship with Norway, Switzerland, Canada, and WTO members.  The Norway Model: Join the EEA  The first option was for the U.K. to join Norway, Iceland, and Lichtenstein in the European Economic Area (EEA), which provides access to the EU's single market for most goods and services (agriculture and fisheries are excluded). At the same time, the EEA is outside the customs union, so Britain could have entered into trade deals with non-EU countries.  But the arrangement was hardly a win-win. The U.K. would be bound by some\"}"
