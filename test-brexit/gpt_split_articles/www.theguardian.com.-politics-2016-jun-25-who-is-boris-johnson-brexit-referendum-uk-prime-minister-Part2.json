He may be about to greatly enhance his own standing, but only at the cost of diminishing that of the country he seeks to lead.  He stepped down as mayor of London last month, after eight years. Yet in the EU referendum the city he led for so long voted 60% to 40% for Remain, exposing another vast gulf in his posturing.  Then there is the paradox that a politician who has issues with integrity should liken himself none-too subtly to Winston Churchill, the British wartime leader who had no problem expressing his true mind. Here again, the question arises of the demarcation line between the genuine Boris Johnson and his scheming alter ego.

The rise of an opportunistic politician who plays on populist fears about a sluggish economy and immigration to further his own prospects also echoes loudly across the Atlantic. Donald Trump's \\\"insurgent\\\" assault on the US presidency begs inevitable comparison.    It's not just that the two men both have funny hair, which gave the Briton the uncomfortable experience of being mistaken for the real estate billionaire on a recent trip to New York. It's that they both appear to be driven by one political aim above all others: their own ascendancy.    Should both achieve their objective, the chilling prospect opens of two master self-publicists with outsized egos ensconced in Downing Street and the Oval Office. Now that would truly be a special relationship.\"}"
