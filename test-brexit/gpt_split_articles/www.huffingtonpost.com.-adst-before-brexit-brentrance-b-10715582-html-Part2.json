My last meeting was with the number three man in the French Foreign Office, Olivier Wormser. He was always a very tough negotiator and a thorough Frenchman. I explained how Kennedy and Macmillan had met and how the British were earnestly seeking entry into the EEC. He just shook his head and he said, \\\"You know, the trouble with you and the British is that you think you speak the same language.\\\"  He made a valid point, by saying that the British were not ready for their entry in the EEC. Ironically, the agreement eventually defeated itself because de Gaulle was so furious that the Americans were helping the British acquire the bomb (and not the French) that he vowed to veto British entry into the EEC.  At the beginning of the 60's, British entry into the EEC seemed impossible. However, to try and jumpstart further negotiations on British integration, George Ball sent me to London in 1963 as head of the Economic Section of the Embassy... When I arrived in London [in 1963], we were in the middle of a dispute called the Chicken War. The Chicken War was all about how the United States could not get its chickens into the European Community. They managed to come up with regulations that denied us this great export from Arkansas.I remember my first press conference at the Embassy -- a young officer new to London explaining the Chicken War to a very doubtful but amused British press corps. What I really wanted to do, and what Ball wanted me to do, was go to London and get immersed into the politics of the European Community there, because it was the time of their second application to the EEC.  I did a lot of speaking around the country. Not saying, \\\"You must join\\\" but finding a way during the middle of trade negotiations to talk about trade and what access to the Common Market could mean for British trade.  I wanted to get through the implicit message that there did not seem to be any other place for the British to go except the European Union, and then kind of educating people about it this one option. I told them that it wasn't simply a free trade area, but that these fellows on the continent had higher aspirations, involving a much more politicized and political union.  There was a group that worked out of Chatham House, which was a British Council on Foreign Relations that was building up support for joining the European Community. I encouraged some of my friends on the continent to come on over to London to talk at Chatham House, and by doing so establish communication with the British who were beginning to be pro-European. Around that time, a political group was formed that was much more favorable to the European Community than either of the two leadership parties. Within the parties, there were also people who were very pro-European and they helped convince most of the politicians that integration was a smart move for Britain.  However, some politicians were a real thorn in this European integration debate because they promised to uphold Britain's national identity.  Ironically, the man who swore up and down that he would never let it happen was a conservative politician from Scotland. It took all the efforts of the smaller group of people who were favorable to integration to overcome nationalist opposition. It was not so much that they were convinced Europeanists, like Monnet, but they pragmatically saw that even though they were close to the United States, they were losing their Empire status and they could not afford to stay out of Europe.
