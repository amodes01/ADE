Wisely, a majority of her voters saw through the EU illusion and decided they should abandon the vessel.  The British lifeboat will likely be on troubled waters for a while until she steadies on her beam, but that's better than being on a plunging ship.  But why is the ship sinking?

The EU is most definitely not singing that. The framers of its constitution intentionally left out reference to God and Europe's Christian roots because, they said, such inclusions might be divisive.  They may as well have been singing, \\\"As Far From God As We Can Get.\\\"  A leader of Britain's National Secular Society said: \\\"We are very glad a reference to God has been left out, it would have created unnecessary barriers in Europe ... Europe has to be secular for it to be really unified.\\\"  In light of the disjointedness of European society one can only say, \\\"Really?\\\"  It's pointless to include mention of God in the EU constitution because of \\\"the increased secularization of morality and public life,\\\" declared the British Gay and Lesbian Humanist Association almost fifteen years ago.  The thuggery and explosion of public disorder in many European cities shows graphically what that \\\"secularization\\\" has produced.  Second, the EU \\\"Titanic\\\" is in peril because it is little more than the old Europe attempting to be a new Europe. Though many of the Brussels elite may disdain the past tradition of royal houses, they themselves have become every bit as dominating.  For example, their flowery views of immigration are no less romantic than Queen Victoria's might have been whiling away a sleepy afternoon at Balmoral as the Prussians were invading Denmark.  So the ruling highbrows in the European Parliament seemed oblivious to the way their policies were affecting workers in the British Midlands and big industrial cities. The shock was that this time the blue-collared Labour voters defied that party's potentates. The heaviest voting for Brexit was in working-class areas.  The left is always shouting, \\\"Power to the People!\\\" Now that the people really have taken the slogan seriously the elites are stupefied. Even Hollywood, as represented by such profound political thinkers as Lindsay Lohan, is in an uproar.  Leftists do not like authoritarianism unless it is their own.  Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban is one of Europe's most insightful leaders. \\\"We want a democratic European Union with internal relations, day-to-day rules, an ethnic composition and culture which are determined by the people living in the countries of Europe, rather than by a Brussels elite,\\\" he told a radio interviewer. The current EU elitists are \\\"quite clearly acting against the will of the European peoples,\\\" he said.  Jonathan Sandys is no elitist, but he is the great-grandson of Sir Winston Churchill. He and I co-authored God and Churchill, which explores Jonathan's great-grandfather's spiritual background and providential destiny. Jonathan, a British citizen now living in Houston, very much wanted Britain to remain in the EU.\"}"
