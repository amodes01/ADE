That's a free trade deal that the Tories spent years trying to finalize and promoted as unique access to the world's largest market of 500 million people in 28 countries with a combined GDP of $20 trillion.  \\\"It does not really matter if it is CETA or whatever,\\\" Obhrai said. \\\"We have free-trade agreements with multitudes of countries around the world. We could have free-trade agreements with Britain, Germany, France and doing it all at the same time.\\\"  During his decade as the parliamentary secretary for foreign affairs, Obhrai said he represented Canada at countless forums where the tables were taken over by foreign ministers of European countries as well as a representative of the EU.  \\\"The European Union acts like a sovereign nation!\\\" he said.  The European Union has grown too big. Either this is a lesson for them, what has happened, and if Britain leaves, it's fine it will bring them down to size, if they do not, they will have other revolts as well.\\\"  Advertisement  Scheer calls for Brexit  On Saturday, another Conservative MP, former speaker of the House of Commons Andrew Scheer, penned an op-ed suggesting a Brexit would be better for Britain and better for local decision-making.  \\\"The supremacy of Parliament - the will of the people expressed through their elected representatives - is increasingly being replaced by the dictates of EU bureaucrats in Brussels,\\\" Scheer wrote.  Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, however, firmly supports Britain's continued participation in the EU.  \\\"More unity is a path toward greater prosperity. We have a great relationship with a strong and united Europe and certainly hope that that continues,\\\" he told Reuters in May. \\\"Britain is always going to have clout, it's just obviously amplified by its strength as part of the EU.\\\"  A British exit from the EU would strip the organization from its second-largest economy, one of its top military powers and its biggest financial centre, the news agency noted.\"}"
