He is meeting his counterpart Nirmala Sitharaman, finance minister Arun Jaitley and other government officials in Delhi to prepare for a free trade agreement between the two countries once Britain has exited the EU.  It is the first in a series of global trade meetings the Business Secretary will conduct over the coming months, including visits to the United States, China, Japan and South Korea.  Before setting off Mr Javid said: \\\"Following the referendum result, my absolute priority is making sure the UK has the tools it needs to continue to compete on the global stage.\\\"  Brexit has been closely watched in India particularly by exporters.  Dr Jagdish Joshi of Jarosniv Exports has been trading with companies in Britain and other European countries for many decades, and he's anxious of the outcome.  He told Sky News: \\\"It is essential to have a bilateral agreement with the UK individually. This will solve a lot of business problems. The deal will be the best solution for the future. Do not forget the UK is our largest business partner, more than 30% of exports go to the UK.\\\"  A free trade agreement between India and the EU has been held up for nine years over contentious issues.  A bilateral trade agreement could be easier and faster to make.
