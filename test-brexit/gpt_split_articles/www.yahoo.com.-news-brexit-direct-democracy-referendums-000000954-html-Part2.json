Some are so ill-thought-out that they achieve the opposite of their intent: for all its small-government pretensions, Proposition 13 ended up centralizing California's finances, shifting them from local to state government. Rather than being the curb on elites that they were supposed to be, ballot initiatives have become a tool of special interests, with lobbyists and extremists bankrolling laws that are often bewildering in their complexity and obscure in their ramifications. And they have impoverished the state's representative government. Who would want to sit in a legislature where 70-90% of the budget has already been allocated?\\\"  The best evidence of the effects of this dysfunction perhaps is that during this period, California experienced a precipitous decline in its credit rating. In 1980, California had an AAA rating. By the early 1990s it had fallen to single A, and it bounced around that level for decades until as recently as 2014, when it was the second-lowest rated state in the nation. (This is a state, of course, with Silicon Valley, Hollywood, oil and gas, timber, minerals and the richest farmland in the nation.) Say what you will about Jerry Brown (twice!), Arnold Schwarzenegger and Pete Wilson, but it ain't all the governors' fault. In fact it may be Jerry Brown's multiterm experience with government by referendum that has allowed him get a handle on the state's finances and help boost its credit rating back up to AA (from S&P), its highest rating since 2001. But that's hardly consolation.  Direct democracy does have a shining example of efficacy, and that is Switzerland, though there certainly are reasons particular to that country - homogeneity being one - that explain why it has worked there.  Otherwise, I would argue that direct democracy is best used sparingly, for local initiatives perhaps. A big drawback of direct democracy is that those who want change - no matter its validity - are much more fired up than those who want to maintain the status quo, and therefore many more of the \\\"Changers\\\" go to the polls, as was perhaps the case in the Brexit vote. Think about the consequences of that.  I know it sounds horribly anachronistic, but checks and balances, branches of government, and slow, messy and deliberate governance actually have their place. It is true that both in the case of Britain's relationship with the EU and with real estate taxes in California in the 1970s, real change was needed. In cases like this, and probably just in general, politicians need to step up more briskly than they are typically comfortable doing. But putting the onus all back on the people may not be the answer. One thing's for sure, it certainly has its consequences.
