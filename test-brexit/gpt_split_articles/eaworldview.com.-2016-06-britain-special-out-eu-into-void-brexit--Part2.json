"{\"uid\": \"eaworldview.com.-2016-06-britain-special-out-eu-into-void-brexit-\", \"text\": \"while the Leave campaign made much of its desire to \\\"take back control\\\", the UK may well find itself with remarkably little \\\"control\\\" over the final agreement and its future relationship with the EU.  Huw Macartney: Shock and Decline  This will certainly be a Black Friday for sterling and global financial markets. The real issue is the longer-term decline that will follow the immediate shock.  Even the Brexit campaigners admitted that Exit would inevitably be painful in the \\\"short term\\\". Aside from the blame tactics, against Europe and immigrants, used by the Brexiteers though, there was also a promise of hope.  Yet we have already seen the effect that the Referendum uncertainty had on investment and the economic recovery in the first half of 2016. And so as that uncertainty continues, almost certainly for more than the two year renegotiation period, recession will lead to further job losses and welfare cuts and that hope will quickly evaporate.  Experts predicted this, but we were told that we did not need experts. But the reality is that the Leave voters were not told how bad things are going to get (for them).  And as that reality starts to bite, the politics of hate, targeting immigrants and the politics of austerity, targeting the poor, will only increase. If we think Britain looks divided now, I fear that our condition is only going to deteriorate.  Scott Lucas: \\\"God Help Our Country\\\"  The former leader of the Liberal Democrats, Paddy Ashdown, captured the moment in four words after the BBC declared victory for the Leave campaign in Britain's EU referendum:  God help our country.  I could try to soften Ashdown's reaction or cloak it in academic analysis. I will not.  See full response in Britain Analysis: \\\"God Help Our Country\\\" - UK Out of European Union  Catherine Needham: The National Health Service  What are the implications of the referendum result for the NHS? There are lots of things we do not know yet. Here are some that we do:  What will not happen is \\u00a3350 million a week more for the NHS. Even the UK Independence party leader Nigel Farage said, soon after the result was announced, that it was \\\"a mistake\\\" to make that claim. The NHS faces intense financial pressures and the best way to address those pressures is through a growing economy and increased tax revenues. The financial uncertainties introduced by the Leave vote look very unlikely to generate that growth, in the short-term at least.  The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership - a trade deal between the US and the EU that had been feared by some as exposing the NHS to marketization - is likely to recede from view as Britain \\\"takes back\\\" its \\\"sovereignty\\\". However, people opposed to NHS marketization would be na\\u00efve to see this as an EU-led agenda, when so much of the opening up of the NHS to market competition has come from the policies of recent Westminster governments.  Health services research will suffer as universities find sources of European funding closed off, as well as reduced freedom of movement for academics and students sharing knowledge across the continent.  Anthony Arnull: The Burden of Black Friday  A question near the top of the Government's agenda, following the vote to leave the EU, will be when to inform the Union that the UK intends to withdraw. Once that is done, there would then be a period of up to two years to reach an agreement. That period could be extended, but only if everyone agrees.  The agreement would deal with disentangling the UK from the rest of the EU. What should be done about EU\"}"
